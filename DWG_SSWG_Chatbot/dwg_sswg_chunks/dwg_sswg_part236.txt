present capabilities consistent with the DGR/DESR requirements in the ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide. 
RE provided models will be used to represent synchronous DGRs. If the RE is not required to provide a model and/or an adequate model is not available to DWG, a generic model with DWG approved parameters in the ERCOT DWG DG Parameterization Guideline will be used with capabilities consistent with the DGR requirements in the ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide.
3.5.2 Settlement Only Distribution Generator (SODG)
RE provided models will be used to represent inverter-based SODGs with nameplate capacity of 5 MW or greater. If the RE is not required to provide a model and/or an adequate model is not available to DWG, the DER_A model with DWG approved parameters in the ERCOT DWG DG Parameterization Guideline will be used.
