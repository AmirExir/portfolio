Foreword
This Procedure Manual is intended for use by the stakeholder members of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) for the purpose of creating and maintaining the dynamics database and dynamics simulation cases which are used to evaluate the dynamic performance of the ERCOT system.  



â€ƒ
Activities of the Dynamics Working Group (DWG)
	The DWG builds dynamic data sets and dynamic study cases for the ERCOT system from data supplied by equipment owners. ERCOT coordinates the compilation and publication of dynamic
