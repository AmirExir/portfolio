t be identified by “SS”. If there are multiple self-serve loads at the same bus, then the self-serve loads will be identified by S1, S2, S3, etc.  See Section 4.3.1.1.  Partial self-serve load should be modeled as a multiple load with “SS” identifying the self-serve portion. See Appendix E for additional details.
(2)	The load data record zone number must be in the zone range of the TSP submitting the load, or in the zone range of ERCOT for loads associated with PUNs.  Zone numbers for loads do not have to be the same as the bus to which the load is connected.
(3)	Generator auxiliary load should not be modeled at generating station buses. Refer to section 4.3.1. 
(4)	In conformance with NERC Reliability Standards and the Planning Guide Section 6.5, entities not having representation on SSWG shall submit their load data to ERCOT or, if the directly connected TDSP has agreed to be the agent on SSWG for that entity, to that TSP.  If load data is not timely submitted on the schedule and in
