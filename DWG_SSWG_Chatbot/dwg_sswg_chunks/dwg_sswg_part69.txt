t other ratings (e.g., Rate 1) should be used.  If problems exist using Rate 2 and Rate 2 is significantly different from Rate 4, then ERCOT will contact the TSP. There may also be 8888 or 9999 ratings in the SSWG Cases. The 8888 rating represents items such as change of ownership at a substation facility, a radial Point Of Interconnect to a customer, normally open facilities inside a substation used for load transfer and other similar situations that are not an integral part of the transmission grid itself. The 8888 ratings are used by the facility owner to indicate they have reviewed the rating. The 9999 ratings are a default value assigned to facilities by the NMMS system as part of the base case preparation; they apply to similar situations as the 8888 ratings and are not an integral part of the transmission grid itself. For Rate 5, the default value for an element that is not protected by a relay loadability rating is 88888, and the default value for an element that will be protec
