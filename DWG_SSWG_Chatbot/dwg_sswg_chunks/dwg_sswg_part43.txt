Self-Serve Generation
Self-serve generators serve local load that does not flow through the ERCOT transmission system. Generation dispatch may be submitted by TSPs on a biannual basis for self-serve facilities serving self-serve load modeled in the SSWG Case. If no generation dispatch is submitted by the TSPs, ERCOT will dispatch the units accordingly to meet the self-serve load.  Total self-serve generation MWs shall match total self-serve load MWs. 
4.3.1.4	Distribution Generation Resources, Distribution Energy Storage Resources, and Settlement Only Distribution Generators 
ERCOT will utilize Resource Registration data provided by IEs/REs to model DGR, DESR, and SODG. SODG will be aggregated by fuel type and represented as a simple model and will be assumed to operate at unity power factor with no voltage control.
4.3.1.5	Coordination with other ERCOT Working Groups 
All generator data should be coordinated with the Dynamics Working Group, Operations Working Group, Network Data Suppo
