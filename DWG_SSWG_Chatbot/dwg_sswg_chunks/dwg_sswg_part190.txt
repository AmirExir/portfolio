imulations should be run for a minimum of 20 seconds and show that the facility response has stabilized. 
Example test cases for an Inverter-Based Resource (IBR) with a STATCOM and a synchronous generator test case are shown below.
 

 
3.1.5.2 Flat Start Test
Perform a no-disturbance test of the prepared simulation case as described in Section 3.1.5.1 above for a minimum of 20 seconds.  Flat responses of voltage, MW, MVAR, and frequency, as shown in the figure below, are expected to remain very close to the initial system condition. 
 
3.1.5.3 Small Voltage Disturbance Test
Apply a 3% step increase, and in a separate simulation, a 3% step decrease of voltage at the POI.  The plant Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) and the associated droop and dead-band settings (if applicable) should transition the plant to/near maximum leading power factor , or in the latter case, to/near maximum lagging power factor in an attempt to regulate the original voltage set point.  Any oscillations should b
