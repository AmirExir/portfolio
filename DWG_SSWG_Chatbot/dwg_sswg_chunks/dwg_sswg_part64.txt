4.4	Branch Data
4.4.1	Use of Branch Record Data Fields
All existing and planned transmission lines (60 kV and above) shall be modeled in the SSWG Cases.
4.4.1.1	Bus Specifications 
The end points of each branch in the SSWG Cases are specified by “from” and “to” bus numbers.  In most cases the end point buses are in the same TSP area.  However, when the “from” and “to” buses used to specify a branch are in different TSP areas, the branch is considered to be a tie line (See Section 4.4.3, Coordination of Tie Lines). Branch data includes exactly two buses. The end points of Multi-Section Lines (MSL) are defined by two buses specified in a branch data record (See Section 4.4.2). There are other components that are modeled with more than two buses, such as transformers with tertiary
