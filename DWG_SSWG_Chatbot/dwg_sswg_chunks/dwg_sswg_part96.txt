4.7	Dynamic Control Devices
All existing and planned FACTS devices shall be modeled in the SSWG Cases. There are a multitude of FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission System) devices currently available, comprising shunt devices, such as Static VAR Compensator (SVC), Static Compensator (STATCOM), series devices such as the Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC), combined devices such as the Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) and the Interline Power Flow Controller
