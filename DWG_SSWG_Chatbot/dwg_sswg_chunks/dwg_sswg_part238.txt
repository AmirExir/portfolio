t start cases and providing associated dynamic contingencies.  The DWG shall begin the flat start case development process as soon as practicable after SSWG base cases are posted â€“ normally in May.  The DWG shall prepare flat start cases for near term on-peak, near term off-peak and long-term on-peak conditions to facilitate planning assessments required by NERC Standard TPL-001-4 and TPL-001-5.1 (effective July 1, 2023).  It is intended that the three dynamic data sets be developed concurrently to be utilized in planning assessments for the next year (YR+1).  The following diagram presents a schedule as a reference for DWG flat start case development:
