Appendix E

Load ID Prefixes

This appendix provides an explanation of selected Load ID prefixes with specific meaning that correspond to modeling in the SSWG Cases.

Types of Loads	Load ID Prefix	Load ID	Comment	Explanation
				
City Loads	E	E1	Two loads connected to same bus 	Loads for which a TSP has historically submitted data but no longer accepts responsibility.
		E2		
				
Self-Serve Loads	S	S1	Two loads connected to same bus 	Self-Serve units
		S2		
		SS	Only one unit	
				
Co-Located Large Loads	U	U#		Loads 75 MW or greater, that are going or have gone through the LLI process, co-located with generation facilities and registered as either CLR or NCLR.
Co-Located Large Loads	V	V#		Loads 75 MW or greater, that are going or have gone through the LLI process co-located with generation facilities and not registered as either CLR or NCLR.
				
Large Transmission Loads	X	X#		Loads 75 MW or greater, that are going or have gone through the LLI process, connected to Transmission and registered as either CLR or NCLR.
Large Transmission Loads	Y	Y#		Loads 75 MW or greater, that are going or have gone through the LLI process, connected to Transmission and not registered as either CLR or NCLR.

 
Appendix F 
 
Technical Rationale for Less limiting Facilities 
 
ERCOT and TSPs shall model Facility Ratings and System steady-state voltage limits (voltage-based Facility Ratings) that are equally limiting or more limiting than operational Facility Ratings and voltage limits developed in accordance with the ERCOT System Operating Limit (SOL) Methodology for the Operations Time Horizon, as represented in the MOD Base Case. Facility Ratings and voltage limits include, but are not limited to, bus voltage limits, transformer ratings, line ratings, breaker ratings, and switch ratings.

ERCOT or TSPs must provide one of the following technical rationale to model less limiting Facility Ratings or voltage limits in the SSWG Cases:

•	Transmission Project, for planned transmission projects that would modify transmission facilities. This category generally applies to the following PMCR types:
o	Tier 1, 2, 3, & 4
o	No_TPIT
o	Generation Interconnection
•	Data Corrections, for modeling adjustments to correct errors that cannot be corrected in the operational Facility Rating or voltage limit. This category generally applies to the following PMCR type:
o	Standard_PMCR
•	Data Updates, for data quality checks and updates for in-service equipment and to reflect as-built Facilities. This category generally applies to the following PMCR types:
o	NOMCR_Pending
o	NOMCR_Submitted
•	Other, for technical rationale that is not in one of the above categories

Foreword
This Procedure Manual is intended for use by the stakeholder members of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) for the purpose of creating and maintaining the dynamics database and dynamics simulation cases which are used to evaluate the dynamic performance of the ERCOT system.  



 
Activities of the Dynamics Working Group (DWG)
	The DWG builds dynamic data sets and dynamic study cases for the ERCOT system from data supplied by equipment owners. ERCOT coordinates the compilation and publication of dynamics data and dynamics study cases. The dynamics data are published in the form of dynamics study cases (flat start cases) as described within this document.
	The DWG prepares the annual update of the Stability Book that documents dynamic data used in the flat start cases.
	The DWG provides a forum for discussing dynamic modeling and system dynamic performance issues and questions.
	The DWG performs other activities as directed by the Reliability and Operating Subcommittee (ROS).
