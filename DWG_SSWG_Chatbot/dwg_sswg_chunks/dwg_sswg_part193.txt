the model should inject reactive current throughout the voltage recovery period.  At the POI, both P and Q are necessarily zero during zero voltage. Q injection at the POI should be observable immediately or very shortly after voltage begins ramp up from zero.
	For 0.9 pu sustained POI voltage, the AVR should provide voltage support that moves the resource towards nearly full reactive production (significantly lagging).
	Real power recovery should start prior to the POI voltage recovering to 0.9 pu.
	Real power should recover to full output within 1.0 seconds of POI voltage recovery to 0.9 pu.  A modest real power reduction  (typically 5% of Pmax or less) may be acceptable to accommodate greater terminal reactive power injection for sustained POI voltages in the range of 0.90 pu to 0.95 pu provided real power fully recovers when POI voltage returns to normal operating range (0.95-1.05 pu).
