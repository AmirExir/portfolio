nit shall be provided using a base MVA (MBASE) in accordance with appropriate modeling techniques for the software platform, where the MBASE is typically the generator MVA rating.
	No model shall restrict the DWG from using any integration time-step less than or equal to a ¼ cycle in simulations when using positive sequence simulation tools.
	No model in the DWG’s Unacceptable Model List shall be used. Refer to Section 3.1.10.
	Standard Dynamic Models
The use of standard dynamic models provided by the software is preferred when they can accurately represent the dynamic performance of the device being modeled. 
	User-Written Dynamic Models
A user written model is any model that is not a standard library model within the software(s) and version(s) listed in Section 3.1.1.  When no compatible standard dynamic model(s) provided within the software can be used to represent the dynamics of a device, accurate and appropriate user written models can be used, if accepted by ERCOT and the DWG af
