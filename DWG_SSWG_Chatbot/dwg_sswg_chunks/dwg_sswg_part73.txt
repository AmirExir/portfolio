these taps would be served by means of low-side rollover to buses 4100 and 4671 on Circuit 21.  This is the type of situation for which multi-section lines are used to accurately model load flows.

 
Figure 1.  Example of circuits needing to use multi-section line modeling.

Figure 2 represents a power-flow data model of the circuits in Figure 1.  Branch data record would have included the following:
4001,4099,09,…
4099,4672,09,…
4672,4742,09,…
4001,4100,21,…
4100,4671,21,…
4671,4742,21,…
along with the necessary bus, load, and shunt data.  To identify these two circuits as multi-section lines, entries must be made in the raw data input file.  The multi-section line data record format is as follows:
                    
 
I,J,ID,DUM1,DUM2, … DUM9  where :

I	“From bus” number.
J	“To bus” number. 
ID	Two characters multi-section line grouping identifier. The first character must be an ampersand (“&”).  ID = ‘&1’ by default.
DUMi	Bus numbers, or extended bus name enclosed in single quot
