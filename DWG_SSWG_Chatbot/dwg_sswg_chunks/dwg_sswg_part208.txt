nse time to 90% of the initial change in instantaneous reactive power should occur within 1 cycle. 

	After each step change resulting in POI voltage above or below the nominal value, the reactive power should start to transition toward the maximum reactive capability of the plant in an attempt to regulate the original voltage set point.

 

3.1.5.12 AGS-ESR Frequency Change and Inertia Response Test
This test is to evaluate the active power response of the ESR and to estimate its inertia response to frequency change. The test system should be set up with a SCR of 3 at the connection point and with a X/R ratio of 6. The initial dispatch of ESR should be set to zero for active power with approximately zero reactive power
The figure below illustrates the frequency profile applied to the source at the POI, with initial ramps of 1 Hz/s followed by 0.3 Hz steps which is the same test for the existing IBRs.
 
The following performance criteria apply:
