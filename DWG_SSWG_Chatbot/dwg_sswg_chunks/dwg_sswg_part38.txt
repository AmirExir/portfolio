resenting the aggregated total nameplate value for UDG behind each load point in each load distributed generation field, with the ‘Distributed Generation Operator Mode’ field disabled. This is to ensure that only the aggregated total nameplate capability for the UDG is reflected in the models. Enabling the ‘Distributed Generation Operator Mode’ field could risk disproportionate representation of the UDG contribution due to the load models currently aggregating UDG contributions.
4.2.2	Load Data Source	
NMMS determines the bus where the load is connected.  TSPs and ERCOT will assign MW and MVAR values by submitting Load/Generation Profiles through MOD.  New loads or corrections to the location of existing loads will be submitted by PMCR through MOD.
