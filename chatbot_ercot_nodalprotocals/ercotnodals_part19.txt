8.1.1.4	Ancillary Service and Energy Deployment Compliance Criteria 
(1)	ERCOT shall measure the performance of each Resource in providing Ancillary Services and energy in response to Dispatch Instructions according to the requirements in the sections below.  Failure to meet these requirements will be reported to the Reliability Monitor as non-compliance.  
8.1.1.4.1	Regulation Service and Generation Resource/Controllable Load Resource Energy Deployment Performance, and Ancillary Service Capacity Performance Metrics
(1)	ERCOT shall limit the deployment of Regulation Service of each QSE for each LFC cycle equal to 125% of the total amount of Regulation Service in the ERCOT System divided by the number of control cycles in five minutes.
(2)	For those Resources that do not have a Resource Status of ONDSR or ONDSRREG or Intermittent Renewable Resource (IRR) Groups with no member IRR having a status of ONDSR or ONDSRREG, ERCOT shall compute the GREDP for each Generation Resource that is On-Line and released to SCED Base Point Dispatch Instructions.  The GREDP is calculated for each five-minute clock interval as a percentage and in MWs for those Resources with a Resource Status that is not ONDSR or ONDSRREG as follows:
GREDP (%) = ABS[((ATG – AEPFR)/(ABP + ARI)) – 1.0] * 100
GREDP (MW) = ABS(ATG – AEPFR – ABP - ARI)
Where:
ATG = Average Telemetered Generation = the average telemetered generation of the Generation Resource or for the aggregate of the IRRs within an IRR Group for the five-minute clock interval
ARI = Average Regulation Instruction = the amount of regulation that the Generation Resource or IRR Group should have produced based on the LFC deployment signals, calculated by LFC, during each five-minute clock interval
∆frequency is actual frequency minus 60 Hz
EPFR = Estimated Primary Frequency Response (MW) = if │∆frequency│≤ Governor Dead-Band then EPFR = zero, if not then if ∆frequency > zero, EPFR = (∆frequency - Governor Dead-Band)/((droop value * 60) – Governor Dead-Band) * HSL * -1, if not then if ∆frequency < zero, EPFR = (∆frequency + Governor Dead-Band)/((droop value * 60) – Governor Dead-Band) * HSL * -1
AEPFR = Average Estimated Primary Frequency Response = the Estimated Primary Frequency Response (MW) will be calculated every four seconds using a Resource specific droop value where 5% droop = 0.05 the Governor Dead-Band (Hz) and Resource HSL (MW) provided by the Resource Entity, and the frequency deviation (Hz) from 60 Hz and averaged for the five-minute clock interval.  For Combined Cycle Generation Resources, or Generation Resources that have been approved to telemeter Non-Frequency Responsive Capacity (NFRC), the HSL will be reduced by the telemetered NFRC MW to calculate the EPFR.  For Combined Cycle Generation Resources, 5.78% Governor droop shall be used.  The Resource-specific calculations will be aggregated for IRR Groups.
ABP = Average Base Point = the time-weighted average of a linearly ramped Base Point or sum of Base Points for IRR Groups, for the five-minute clock interval.  The linearly ramped Base Point is calculated every four seconds such that it ramps from its initial value to the SCED Base Point over a five-minute period.  The initial value of the linearly ramped Base Point will be the four-second value of the previous linearly ramped Base Point at the time the new SCED Base Point is received into the ERCOT Energy Management System (EMS).  In the event that the SCED Base Point is received after the five-minute ramp period, the linearly ramped Base Point will continue at a constant value equal to the ending four-second value of the five-minute ramp. 
(3)	For all of a QSE’s Resources that have a Resource Status of ONDSR or ONDSRREG (“Dynamically Scheduled Resource (DSR) Portfolio”), ERCOT shall calculate an aggregate GREDP as a percentage and in MWs for those Resources as follows:
GREDP (%) = ABS[(∑DSR ATG – ∑DSR DBPOS + Intra-QSE Purchase – Intra-QSE Sale – ARRDDSRLR – AECRDDSRLR – ANSDDSRLR – ∑DSR AEPFR) / (ATDSRL + ∑DSR ARI) – 1.0] * 100
GREDP (MW) = ABS(∑DSR ATG – ∑DSR DBPOS – ATDSRL– ARRDDSRLR – AECRDDSRLR – ANSDDSRLR + Intra-QSE Purchase - Intra-QSE Sale – ∑DSR AEPFR – ∑DSR ARI)
Where:
∑DSR ATG = Sum of Average Telemetered Generation for all Resources with a Resource Status of ONDSR or ONDSRREG of the QSE for the five-minute clock interval
∑DSR ARI = Sum of Average Regulation Instruction for all Resources with a Resource Status of ONDSR or ONDSRREG of the QSE for the five-minute clock interval
ATDSRL = Average Telemetered DSR Load = the average telemetered DSR Load for the QSE for the five-minute clock interval
Intra-QSE Purchase = Energy Trade where the QSE is both the buyer and seller with the flag set to “Purchase”
Intra-QSE Sale = Energy Trade where the QSE is both the buyer and seller with the flag set to “Sale”
∑DSR AEPFR = Sum of Average Estimated Primary Frequency Response for all Resources with a Resource Status of ONDSR or ONDSRREG of the QSE for the five-minute clock interval
∑DSR DBPOS = Sum of the difference between a linearly ramped Base Point minus Output Schedule for all Resources with a Resource Status of ONDSR or ONDSRREG of the QSE for the five-minute clock interval.  The linearly ramped Base Point is calculated every four seconds such that it ramps from its initial value to the SCED Base Point over a five minute period
ARRDDSRLR = Average Responsive Reserve Deployment DSR Load Resource = the average RRS energy deployment for the five-minute clock interval from Load Resources that are part of the DSR Load
AECRDDSRLR = Average ERCOT Contingency Response Deployment DSR Load Resource = the average ECRS energy deployment for the five-minute clock interval from Load Resources that are part of the DSR Load
ANSDDSRLR = Average Non-Spin Deployment DSR Load Resource = the average Non-Spin energy deployment for the five-minute clock interval from Load Resources that are part of the DSR Load
(4)	For CLRs that have a Resource Status of ONRGL or ONCLR, ERCOT shall compute the CLREDP.  The CLREDP will be calculated both as a percentage and in MWs as follows:
CLREDP (%) = ABS[((ATPC + AEPFR)/(ABP – ARI)) – 1.0] * 100
CLREDP (MW) = ABS(ATPC – (ABP – AEPFR – ARI))
Where:
ATPC = Average Telemetered Power Consumption = the average telemetered power consumption of the CLR for the five-minute clock interval
ARI = Average Regulation Instruction = the amount of regulation that the CLR should have produced based on the LFC deployment signals, calculated by LFC, during each five-minute clock interval.  Reg-Up is considered a positive value for this calculation
AEPFR = Average Estimated Primary Frequency Response = the Estimated Primary Frequency Response (MW) will be calculated every four seconds using a Resource specific droop value where 5% droop = 0.05, the Governor Dead-Band (Hz) and Resource HSL (MW) provided by the Resource Entity, and the frequency deviation (Hz) from 60 Hz and averaged for the five-minute clock interval
ABP = Average Base Point = the time-weighted average of a linearly ramped Base Point for the five-minute clock interval.  The linearly ramped Base Point is calculated every four seconds such that it ramps from its initial value to the SCED Base Point over a five-minute period.  The initial value of the linearly ramped Base Point will be the four second value of the previous linearly ramped Base Point at the time the new SCED Base Point is received into the ERCOT EMS.  In the event that the SCED Base Point is received after the five minute ramp period, the linearly ramped Base Point will continue at a constant value equal to the ending four second value of the five-minute ramp.

(12)	If at the end of the month during which GREDP was calculated, a Resource has a GREDP less than X% or Y MW for 85% of the five-minute clock intervals, the Reliability Monitor shall, at the request of the QSE, recalculate GREDP excluding the five-minute clock intervals when a Resource is deployed above the unit’s ramp rate due to ramp rate sharing between energy and Regulation Service.  The requesting QSE shall provide to the Reliability Monitor information validating the ramp rate violation for the intervals in dispute.
8.1.1.4.2	Responsive Reserve Energy Deployment Criteria
(1)	Each QSE providing RRS shall so indicate by appropriate entries in the Resource’s Ancillary Service Schedule and the Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility providing that service.  When manually deployed as specified in Nodal Operating Guide Section 4.8, Responsive Reserve Service During Scarcity Conditions, SCED shall adjust the Generation Resource’s Base Point for any requested RRS energy in the next cycle of SCED as specified in Section 6.5.7.6.2.2, Deployment of Responsive Reserve Service.  For Controllable Load Resources, the QSE shall control its Resources to operate to the Resource’s Scheduled Power Consumption minus any Ancillary Service deployments.  Control performance during periods in which RRS has been self-deployed shall be based on the requirements below and failure to meet any one of these requirements may be reported to the Reliability Monitor as non-compliance:
(a)	Within one minute following a deployment instruction, the QSE must update the telemetered Ancillary Service Schedule for RRS for Generation Resources and Load Resources to reflect the deployment amount.  The difference between the sum of the QSE’s Resource RRS schedules and the sum of the QSE’s Resource RRS responsibilities must be equal to the QSE’s total RRS deployment instruction, excluding the deployment to Load Resources which are not Controllable Load Resources.
(b)	A QSE providing RRS must reserve sufficient Primary Frequency Response capable capacity on each Generation Resource with a RRS responsibility or must reserve sufficient capacity capable of FFR to supply the full amount of RRS scheduled for that Resource.  The QSE shall not use NFRC, such as power augmentation capacity on a Generation Resource, to provide RRS.  
(c)	ERCOT shall evaluate the Primary Frequency Response of all RRS providers as calculated in Nodal Operating Guide Section 8, Attachment J, Initial and Sustained Measurements for Primary Frequency Response.
(2)	For all Frequency Measurable Events (FMEs), ERCOT shall use the recorded data for each two-second scan rate value of real power output for each Generation Resource, Settlement Only Transmission Generator (SOTG), Settlement Only Transmission Self-Generator (SOTSG), Resource capable of FFR providing RRS, and Controllable Load Resource.  ERCOT shall use the recorded MW data beginning one minute before the start of the frequency excursion event until ten minutes after the start of the frequency excursion event.  Satisfactory performance for those Resources with a RRS responsibility must be measured by comparing actual Primary Frequency Response to the expected Primary Frequency Response as required in the Operating Guides. 
(3)	ERCOT shall monitor the Primary Frequency Response that is delivered during FMEs of Generation Resources, SOTGs, SOTSGs, Resources capable of FFR, and Controllable Load Resources with RRS responsibilities using the methodology specified in the Operating Guides.  ERCOT shall monitor the Primary Frequency Response that is delivered during FMEs of Controllable Load Resources, relay response for Loads and Generation Resources operating in the synchronous condenser fast-response mode providing RRS at the frequency specified in paragraph (3)(b) of Section 3.18, Resource Limits in Providing Ancillary Service.
(4)	For QSEs with Load Resources, excluding Controllable Load Resources, ten minutes following deployment instruction the sum of the QSE’s Load Resource response shall not be less than 95% of the requested MW deployment, nor more than 150% of the lesser of the following: 
(i)	The QSE’s Responsibility for RRS from non-Controllable Load Resources; or
(ii)	The requested MW deployment.
	The QSE’s portfolio shall maintain this response until recalled or the Resource’s obligation to provide RRS expires.  The combination of the QSE’s RRS responsibility and additional available capacity shall not exceed 150% of the sum of the QSE’s Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility for RRS from non-Controllable Load Resources.  Any additional available capacity from Load Resources other than Controllable Load Resources shall be deployed concurrently with RRS.
(5)	For Load Resources, excluding Controllable Load Resources, associated with a QSE that does not successfully deploy as defined under this Section, ERCOT shall evaluate, identify and investigate each Load Resource that contributed to such failure, in order to determine failure under paragraph (9) of Section 8.1.1.1, Ancillary Service Qualification and Testing.
(6)	A Load Resource providing RRS excluding Controllable Load Resources must return to at least 95% of its Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility for RRS within three hours following a recall instruction unless replaced by another Resource as described below.  However, the Load Resource should attempt to return to at least 95% of its Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility for RRS as soon as practical considering process constraints.  For a Load Resource that is not a Controllable Load Resource that is unable to return to its Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility within three hours of recall instruction, its QSE may replace the quantity of deficient RRS capacity within that same three hours using other Generation Resources or other Load Resources not previously committed to provide RRS.
(7)	During periods when the Load level of a Load Resource (excluding Controllable Load Resources) has been affected by a Dispatch Instruction from ERCOT, the performance of a Load Resource in response to a Dispatch Instruction must be determined by subtracting the Load Resource’s actual Load response from its Baseline.  “Baseline” capacity is calculated by measuring the average of the real power consumption for five minutes before the Dispatch Instruction if the Load level of a Load Resource had not been affected by a Dispatch Instruction from ERCOT.  The actual Load response is the average of the real power consumption data being telemetered to ERCOT during the Settlement Interval indicated in the Dispatch Instruction.
[NPRR995 and NPRR1011:  Replace applicable portions of Section 8.1.1.4.2 above with the following upon system implementation for NPRR995; or upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project for NPRR1011:]
8.1.1.4.2	Responsive Reserve Energy Deployment Criteria
(1)	Control performance during periods in which RRS has been self-deployed shall be based on the requirements below and failure to meet any one of these requirements may be reported to the Reliability Monitor as non-compliance:
(a)	A QSE providing RRS must reserve sufficient Primary Frequency Response capable capacity on each Generation Resource with a RRS award or must reserve sufficient capacity capable of FFR to supply the full amount of RRS awarded to that Resource.  The QSE shall not use non-FRC, such as power augmentation capacity on a Generation Resource, to provide RRS.  
(b)	ERCOT shall evaluate the Primary Frequency Response of all RRS providers as calculated in Nodal Operating Guide Section 8, Attachment J, Initial and Sustained Measurements for Primary Frequency Response.
(2)	For all Frequency Measurable Events (FMEs), ERCOT shall use the recorded data for each two-second scan rate value of real power output for each Generation Resource, Settlement Only Transmission Generator (SOTG), Settlement Only Transmission Self-Generator (SOTSG), Settlement Only Transmission Energy Storage System (SOTESS), Resource capable of FFR providing RRS, and Controllable Load Resource.  ERCOT shall use the recorded MW data beginning one minute before the start of the frequency excursion event until ten minutes after the start of the frequency excursion event.  Satisfactory performance for those Resources with an RRS award must be measured by comparing actual Primary Frequency Response to the expected Primary Frequency Response as required in the Operating Guides. 
(3)	ERCOT shall monitor the Primary Frequency Response that is delivered during FMEs of Generation Resources, SOTGs, SOTSGs, SOTESSs, Resources capable of FFR, and Controllable Load Resources with RRS responsibilities using the methodology specified in the Operating Guides.  ERCOT shall monitor the Primary Frequency Response that is delivered during FMEs of Controllable Load Resources, relay response for Loads and Generation Resources operating in the synchronous condenser fast-response mode providing RRS at the frequency specified in paragraph (3)(b) of Section 3.18, Resource Limits in Providing Ancillary Service.
(4)	For Resources providing FFR, once the FFR is deployed, the Resource must stay deployed for the duration of the sustained response period, defined as 15 minutes or until the time of recall instruction from ERCOT, whichever occurs first.  A Load Resource that is controlled by a high-set under-frequency relay and is providing FFR may only withdraw energy from the grid after the frequency has recovered to 60 Hz and Physical Responsive Capability (PRC) is above 2,500 MW, or if instructed to do so by ERCOT.
(5)	For a Resource providing RRS with a Resource Status of ONSC, once the RRS is deployed, the Resource must maintain the response until recalled by ERCOT.
(6)	For a Load Resource that is controlled by a high-set under-frequency relay and is providing RRS, once the RRS is deployed, the Resource must maintain the response to the deployment until recalled by ERCOT.
(7)	For QSEs with Load Resources, excluding Controllable Load Resources, ten minutes following deployment instruction the sum of the QSE’s Load Resource response shall not be less than 95% of the requested MW deployment, nor more than 150% of the lesser of the following: 
(i)	The QSE’s award for RRS from non-Controllable Load Resources; or
(ii)	The requested MW deployment.
	The QSE’s portfolio shall maintain this response until recalled.
(8)	For Load Resources, excluding Controllable Load Resources, associated with a QSE that does not successfully deploy as defined under this Section, ERCOT shall evaluate, identify and investigate each Load Resource that contributed to such failure, in order to determine failure under paragraph (9) of Section 8.1.1.1, Ancillary Service Qualification and Testing.
(9)	For a QSE self-providing RRS on Load Resources, excluding Controllable Load Resources that have been deployed for RRS, the QSE may move the self-provided amount to another Load Resource, while maintaining the deployment instructions on the previously deployed Load Resource, if:
(a) 	The Load Resource to which the RRS is to be moved is not a Controllable Load Resource and has not been deployed for RRS; and 
(b)	The self-provided amount of RRS is within the QSE’s portfolio.
(10)	During periods when the Load level of a Load Resource (excluding Controllable Load Resources) has been affected by a Dispatch Instruction from ERCOT, the performance of a Load Resource in response to a Dispatch Instruction must be determined by subtracting the Load Resource’s actual Load response from its Baseline.  “Baseline” capacity is calculated by measuring the average of the real power consumption for five minutes before the Dispatch Instruction if the Load level of a Load Resource had not been affected by a Dispatch Instruction from ERCOT.  The actual Load response is the average of the real power consumption data being telemetered to ERCOT during the Settlement Interval indicated in the Dispatch Instruction.
8.1.1.4.3	Non-Spinning Reserve Service Energy Deployment Criteria
(1)	ERCOT shall, as part of its Ancillary Service deployment procedure under Section 6.5.7.6.2.3, Non-Spinning Reserve Service Deployment, include all performance metrics for a Resource receiving a Non-Spin recall instruction from ERCOT. 
(2)	A Non-Spin Dispatch Instruction from ERCOT must respect the minimum runtime of a Generation Resource.  After the recall of a Non-Spin Dispatch Instruction, any Generation Resource previously Off-Line providing Non-Spin is allowed to remain On-Line for 30 minutes following the recall.  During that time period, the On-Line Generation Resource is treated as if the Non-Spin is being provided.  
(3)	Control performance during periods in which ERCOT has deployed Non-Spin shall be based on the requirements below and failure to meet any one of these requirements for the greater of one or 5% of Non-Spin deployments during a month shall be reported to the Reliability Monitor as non-compliance:
(a)	Within 20 minutes following a deployment instruction, the QSE must update the telemetered Ancillary Service Schedule for Non-Spin for Generation Resources and CLRs to reflect the deployment amount.
(b)	Off-Line Generation Resources, within 25 minutes following a deployment instruction, must be On-Line with an Energy Offer Curve and the telemetered net generation must be greater than or equal to the Resource’s telemetered LSL multiplied by P1 where P1 is defined in the “ERCOT and QSE Operations Business Practices During the Operating Hour.”  The Resource Status that must be telemetered indicating that the Resource has come On-Line with an Energy Offer Curve is ON as described in paragraph (5)(b)(i) of Section 3.9.1, Current Operating Plan (COP) Criteria.
(c)	If an Off-Line Generation Resource experiences a Startup Loading Failure (excluding those caused by operator error), the Resource may be considered for exclusion from performance non-compliance if the QSE provides to ERCOT the following documentation regarding the incident:
(i)	Its generation log documenting the Startup Loading Failure; and 
(ii)	Equipment failure documentation such as, but not limited to, GADS reports, plant operator logs, work orders, or other applicable information.  
(d)	For QSEs with Load Resources that are not CLRs, 30 minutes following deployment instruction the sum of the QSE’s Load Resource response shall not be less than 95% of the requested MW deployment, nor more than 150% of the lesser of the following: 
(i)	The QSE’s award for Non-Spin from Load Resources that are not CLRs; or
(ii)	The requested MW deployment.
	The QSE’s portfolio shall maintain this response until recalled.
(e)	During periods when the Load level of a Load Resource that is not a CLR providing Non-Spin has been affected by a Dispatch Instruction from ERCOT, the performance of a Load Resource in response to a Dispatch Instruction must be determined by subtracting the Load Resource’s actual Load response from its Baseline.  “Baseline” capacity is calculated by measuring the average of the real power consumption for five minutes before the Dispatch Instruction if the Load level of a Load Resource had not been affected by a Dispatch Instruction from ERCOT.  The actual Load response is the difference between the Baseline and the average of the real power consumption data being telemetered to ERCOT over the Settlement Interval for the period beginning 30 minutes after the Dispatch Instruction and ending at the time of recall.  The instantaneous response at any point in time during the sustained response period must be no less than 95% and no more than 150% of the Dispatch Instruction.
(4)	A Load Resource that is not a CLR providing Non-Spin must return to at least 95% of its Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility for Non-Spin within three hours following a recall instruction unless replaced by another Resource as described below.  However, the Load Resource should attempt to return to at least 95% of its Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility for Non-Spin as soon as practical considering process constraints.  For a Load Resource that is not a CLR that is unable to return to its Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility within three hours of recall instruction, its QSE may replace the quantity of deficient Non-Spin capacity within that same three hours using other Resources not previously committed to provide Non-Spin.
(5)	ERCOT may revoke the Ancillary Service qualification of any Load Resource that is not a CLR for failure to comply with the required performance standards, based on the evaluation it performed under this Section.  Specifically, if a Load Resource that is not a CLR that is providing Non-Spin fails to respond with at least 95% of its Dispatch Instruction for Non-Spin within 30 minutes of an ERCOT Dispatch Instruction, that response shall be considered a failure.  Two Load Resource performance failures within any rolling 365-day period shall result in disqualification of that Load Resource.  After six months of disqualification, the Load Resource may reapply for qualification provided it submits a corrective action plan to ERCOT that identifies actions taken to correct performance deficiencies and the disqualified Load Resource successfully passes qualification test as specified in Section 8.1.1.1, Ancillary Service Qualification and Testing.
[NPRR1011 and NPRR1188:  Replace applicable portions of Section 8.1.1.4.3 above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project for NPRR1011; or upon system implementation for NPRR1188:]
8.1.1.4.3	Non-Spinning Reserve Service Energy Deployment Criteria
(1)	ERCOT shall, as part of its Ancillary Service deployment procedure under Section 6.5.7.6.2.3, Non-Spinning Reserve Service Deployment, include all performance metrics for a Resource receiving a Non-Spin recall instruction from ERCOT. 
(2)	A Non-Spin Dispatch Instruction from ERCOT must respect the minimum runtime of a Generation Resource. 
(3)	Control performance during periods in which ERCOT has manually deployed Non-Spin shall be based on the requirements below and failure to meet any one of these requirements for the greater of one or 5% of Non-Spin deployments during a month shall be reported to the Reliability Monitor as non-compliance:
(a)	Off-Line Generation Resources, within 25 minutes following a deployment instruction, must be On-Line with an Energy Offer Curve and the telemetered net generation must be greater than or equal to the Resource’s telemetered LSL multiplied by P1 where P1 is defined in the “ERCOT and QSE Operations Business Practices During the Operating Hour.”  The Resource Status that must be telemetered indicating that the Resource has come On-Line with an Energy Offer Curve is ON as described in paragraph (5)(b)(i) of Section 3.9.1, Current Operating Plan (COP) Criteria.
(b)	If an Off-Line Generation Resource experiences a Startup Loading Failure (excluding those caused by operator error), the Resource may be considered for exclusion from performance non-compliance if the QSE provides to ERCOT the following documentation regarding the incident:
(i)	Its generation log documenting the Startup Loading Failure; and 
(ii)	Equipment failure documentation such as, but not limited to, GADS reports, plant operator logs, work orders, or other applicable information.  
(c)	CLRs must be available to SCED, and must have an Energy Bid Curve and the telemetered net real power consumption must be greater than or equal to the Resource’s telemetered LPC. 
(d)	For QSEs with Load Resources that are not CLRs, 30 minutes following deployment instruction, the sum of the QSE’s Load Resource response shall not be less than 95% of the requested MW deployment, nor more than 150% of the lesser of the following: 
(i)	The QSE’s award for Non-Spin from Load Resources that are not CLRs; or
(ii)	The requested MW deployment.
	The QSE’s portfolio shall maintain this response until recalled.
(e)	During periods when the Load level of a Load Resource that is not a CLR providing Non-Spin has been affected by a Dispatch Instruction from ERCOT, the performance of a Load Resource in response to a Dispatch Instruction must be determined by subtracting the Load Resource’s actual Load response from its Baseline.  “Baseline” capacity is calculated by measuring the average of the real power consumption for five minutes before the Dispatch Instruction if the Load level of a Load Resource had not been affected by a Dispatch Instruction from ERCOT.  The actual Load response is the difference between the Baseline and the average of the real power consumption data being telemetered to ERCOT over the Settlement Interval for the period beginning 30 minutes after the Dispatch Instruction and ending at the time of recall.  The instantaneous response at any point in time during the sustained response period must be no less than 95% and no more than 150% of the Dispatch Instruction.
(4)	Once Non-Spin capacity has been manually deployed by ERCOT, the Resource’s Non-Spin capacity shall remain available for dispatch by SCED until ERCOT issues a recall instruction or the Resource has exhausted its ability to maintain the deployed capacity after meeting the requirements of paragraph (2) of Section 8.1.1.3.3, Non-Spinning Reserve Capacity Monitoring Criteria, whichever occurs first.
(5)	A Load Resource that is not a CLR providing Non-Spin must return to at least 95% of its Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility for Non-Spin within three hours following a recall instruction unless replaced by another Resource as described below.  However, the Load Resource should attempt to return to at least 95% of its Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility for Non-Spin as soon as practical considering process constraints.  For a Load Resource that is not a CLR that is unable to return to its Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility within three hours of recall instruction, its QSE may replace the quantity of deficient Non-Spin capacity within that same three hours using other Resources not previously committed to provide Non-Spin.
(6)	ERCOT may revoke the Ancillary Service qualification of any Load Resource that is not a CLR for failure to comply with the required performance standards, based on the evaluation it performed under this Section.  Specifically, if a Load Resource that is not a CLR that is providing Non-Spin fails to respond with at least 95% of its Dispatch Instruction for Non-Spin within 30 minutes of an ERCOT Dispatch Instruction, that response shall be considered a failure.  Two Load Resource performance failures within any rolling 365-day period shall result in disqualification of that Load Resource.  After six months of disqualification, the Load Resource may reapply for qualification provided it submits a corrective action plan to ERCOT that identifies actions taken to correct performance deficiencies and the disqualified Load Resource successfully passes qualification test as specified in Section 8.1.1.1, Ancillary Service Qualification and Testing.
8.1.1.4.4	ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service Energy Deployment Criteria
(1)	Each QSE providing ECRS shall so indicate by appropriate entries in the Resource’s Ancillary Service Schedule and the Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility providing that service.  ERCOT shall adjust the Generation Resource’s Base Point for any requested ECRS energy in the next cycle of SCED as specified in Section 6.5.7.6.2.4, Deployment and Recall of ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service.  For Controllable Load Resources, the QSE shall control its Controllable Load Resources such that each operates to the Resource’s Scheduled Power Consumption minus any Ancillary Service deployments.  Control performance during periods in which ERCOT has deployed ECRS shall be based on the requirements below and failure to meet any one of these requirements shall be reported to the Reliability Monitor as non-compliance: 
(a)	Within one minute following a deployment instruction, the QSE must update the telemetered Ancillary Service Schedule for ECRS for its Generation Resources and Load Resources to reflect the deployment amount.  The difference between the sum of the QSE’s Resource ECRS schedules and the sum of the QSE’s Resource ECRS responsibilities must be equal to the QSE’s total ECRS deployment instruction, excluding the deployment to Load Resources that are not Controllable Load Resources. 
(b)	For QSEs with Load Resources, excluding Controllable Load Resources, ten minutes following deployment instruction the sum of the QSE’s Load Resource response shall not be less than 95% of the requested MW deployment, nor more than 150% of the lesser of the following: 
(i)	The QSE’s Responsibility for ECRS from non-Controllable Load Resources; or
(ii)	The requested MW deployment.
	The QSE’s portfolio shall maintain this response until recalled.  The combination of the QSE’s ECRS responsibility and additional available capacity shall not exceed 150% of the sum of the QSE’s Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility for ECRS from non-Controllable Load Resources.  Any additional available capacity from Load Resources other than Controllable Load Resources shall be deployed concurrently with ECRS.
(c)	For Load Resources, excluding Controllable Load Resources, associated with a QSE that does not successfully deploy as defined under this Section, ERCOT shall evaluate, identify and investigate each Load Resource that contributed to such failure in order to determine failure under paragraph (9) of Section 8.1.1.1, Ancillary Service Qualification and Testing.
(d)	A Load Resource providing ECRS, excluding Controllable Load Resources, must return to at least 95% of its Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility for ECRS within three hours following a recall instruction unless replaced by another Resource as described below.  However, the Load Resource should attempt to return to at least 95% of its Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility for ECRS as soon as practical considering process constraints.  For a Load Resource that is not a Controllable Load Resource that is unable to return to its Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility within three hours of a recall instruction, its QSE may replace the quantity of deficient ECRS capacity within that same three hours using other Generation Resources or other Load Resources not previously committed to provide ECRS.
(e)	During periods when the Load level of a Load Resource (excluding Controllable Load Resources) has been affected by a Dispatch Instruction from ERCOT, the performance of a Load Resource in response to a Dispatch Instruction must be determined by subtracting the Load Resource’s actual Load response from its Baseline.  “Baseline” capacity is calculated by measuring the average of the real power consumption for five minutes before the Dispatch Instruction if the Load level of a Load Resource had not been affected by a Dispatch Instruction from ERCOT.  The actual Load response is the average of the real power consumption data being telemetered to ERCOT during the Settlement Interval indicated in the Dispatch Instruction.
[NPRR1011:  Replace Section 8.1.1.4.4 above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project for NPRR1011:]
8.1.1.4.4	ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service Energy Deployment Criteria
(1)	Control performance during periods in which ERCOT has manually deployed ECRS shall be based on the requirements below and failure to meet any one of these requirements shall be reported to the Reliability Monitor as non-compliance: 
(a)	For a Resource providing ECRS with a Resource Status of ONSC, once the ECRS is deployed, the Resource must maintain the response until recalled by ERCOT.
(b)       	For QSEs with Load Resources, excluding Controllable Load Resources, ten minutes following deployment instruction the sum of the QSE’s Load Resource response shall not be less than 95% of the requested MW deployment, nor more than 150% of the lesser of the following: 
(i)	The QSE’s awards for ECRS from non-Controllable Load Resources; or
(ii)	The requested MW deployment.
	The QSE’s portfolio shall maintain this response until recalled.  
(c)	For Load Resources, excluding Controllable Load Resources, associated with a QSE that does not successfully deploy as defined under this Section, ERCOT shall evaluate, identify and investigate each Load Resource that contributed to such failure, in order to determine failure under paragraph (9) of Section 8.1.1.1, Ancillary Service Qualification and Testing.
(d)	For a QSE self-providing ECRS on a Load Resource, excluding Controllable Load Resources that have been deployed, the QSE may move the self-provided amount to another Load Resource, while maintaining the deployment instructions on the previously deployed Load Resources, if: 
(i) 	The Load Resource to which the ECRS is to be moved is not a Controllable Load Resource and has not been deployed for ECRS; and
(ii)	The self-provided amount of ECRS is within the QSE’s portfolio.
(e)	During periods when the Load level of a Load Resource (excluding Controllable Load Resources) has been affected by a Dispatch Instruction from ERCOT, the performance of a Load Resource in response to a Dispatch Instruction must be determined by subtracting the Load Resource’s actual Load response from its Baseline.  “Baseline” capacity is calculated by measuring the average of the real power consumption for five minutes before the Dispatch Instruction if the Load level of a Load Resource had not been affected by a Dispatch Instruction from ERCOT.  The actual Load response is the average of the real power consumption data being telemetered to ERCOT during the Settlement Interval indicated in the Dispatch Instruction.
8.1.2	Current Operating Plan (COP) Performance Requirements
(1)	Each QSE representing a Resource must submit a COP in accordance with Section 3.9, Current Operating Plan (COP).
(2)	For each QSE, ERCOT shall post for each month the number, by Operating Hour, of valid COP failures to meet the provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4) of Section 3.9.2, Current Operating Plan Validation, for Ancillary Service Resource Responsibilities contained in the QSE’s COP used for the DRUC and each HRUC during the Operating Day.  QSEs shall have no more than three hours during an Operating Day or 74 hours during a month that contains COP Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility validation failures.

[NPRR1011:  Delete paragraph (2) above upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project and renumber accordingly.]
(3)	For each QSE, ERCOT shall post for each month the number of Operating Hours during which a Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC)-committed QSE Resource, not Off-Line as the result of a Forced Outage, failed to be On-Line and released to SCED for deployment within the first 15 minutes of the RUC-Commitment Hour.  QSEs shall have no more than three hours during an Operating Day and no more than 74 hours during a month that contains one or more of these events.
[NPRR1239:  Replace paragraph (3) above with the following upon system implementation:]

8.1.3	Emergency Response Service Performance and Testing
(1)	Performance metrics for Emergency Response Service (ERS) event performance, availability, and testing are detailed in this section for both ERS Loads and ERS Generators.
8.1.3.1	Performance Criteria for Emergency Response Service Resources
(1)	ERS Resources’ compliance will be based on their performance during ERS deployment event(s), their performance in ERS testing, and their availability during an ERS Contract Period.  The performance evaluation has three purposes:
(a)	To provide the QSE a basis for determining the ERS Resource’s offer capacity; 
(b)	To provide the basis for ERCOT to determine the ERS Resource’s availability during its committed hours in an ERS Contract Period; and 
(c)	To measure and verify the ERS Resource’s performance, as compared to its contracted capacity, during an ERS deployment event or test.
8.1.3.1.1	Baselines for Emergency Response Service Loads
(1)	As part of the ERS procurement process, ERCOT shall notify QSEs of an ERS Load’s eligibility to be evaluated on one or more of the following baselines, which are developed and administered by ERCOT consistent with the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) Practice Standards:
(a)	The “ERS Default Baseline” requires an ERS Load to reduce its Load by its contracted amount, and is a method of estimating the electricity that would have been consumed by an ERS Load in the absence of an ERS deployment event;
(b)	The “ERS Alternate Baseline” requires an ERS Load to reduce Load to a contracted level of electricity Demand (its maximum base load) in an ERS deployment event. 
(2)	ERS Default Baseline:
(a)	As part of its Resource identification process, ERCOT will determine if each ERS Load can qualify under a default baseline methodology.  A default baseline methodology is designed to predict the interval Load based on variables which may include historic Load data, weather, time of day and other relevant calendar information.  ERCOT may use other data variables in a default baseline methodology at ERCOT’s sole discretion, if ERCOT determines the additional data will enhance the accuracy of the default baseline.  Development of a default baseline for each ERS Load will be consistent with practices described in the document entitled “Demand Response Baseline Methodologies” posted on the ERCOT website.  
(b)	For aggregated ERS Loads, ERCOT may develop either a single baseline model at the aggregate level or multiple baseline models for individual sites and/or subsets of sites within the aggregation.  If ERCOT develops the model at the site and/or subset level, ERCOT shall establish the default baseline for the aggregated ERS Load by summing the baselines of the individual sites and/or subsets of sites in the aggregation.  ERCOT shall verify the performance at the ERS Load level.
(c)	ERCOT will develop a default baseline for an ERS Load by analyzing historic 15-minute interval usage data.
(d)	If ERCOT determines that an ERS Load qualifies for a default baseline, ERCOT shall provide default baseline analysis results for the ERS Load to the QSE representing that ERS Resource.
(3)	ERS Alternate Baseline:
(a)	ERCOT may assign an ERS Load to an alternate baseline formula for one of the following reasons:
(i)	ERCOT determines that the ERS Load does not have sufficient predictability for a default baseline;
(ii)	The QSE requests an alternate baseline for the ERS Load; or
(iii)	ERCOT has insufficient historical meter data available at the time of baseline evaluation to accurately model the ERS Load.
(b)	If, following ERS procurement, ERCOT determines that sufficient historical data is available and the ERS Load has sufficient predictability for a default baseline, ERCOT with the QSE’s consent may reassign the ERS Load to a default baseline, notify the QSE of the reassignment, and calculate performance for the ERS Contract Period accordingly.  
(c)	Under the alternate baseline formula, ERCOT shall calculate an ERS Load’s average (mean) Load (MWh) over the most recent available 12-month period, with an emphasis on the months corresponding to the upcoming ERS Standard Contract Term.  ERCOT will validate the MW capacity offer for each ERS Load for the applicable ERS Time Period, based upon the difference between this average Load calculation (MWh) and the ERS Load’s declared maximum base Load (MWh).  In selecting an ERS Load with an alternate baseline, ERCOT may award the lesser of the MW offer or the MW capacity validated by ERCOT.  
(4)	ERS Weather-Sensitive Load:
(a)	ERCOT shall assign a residential Weather-Sensitive ERS Load to either the regression baseline performance evaluation methodology or the control group baseline performance evaluation methodology.  Both methodologies are described in the document entitled “Demand Response Baseline Methodologies” posted to the ERCOT website.  The control group baseline performance evaluation methodology shall only be available to ERS Loads consisting entirely of residential sites.
(i)	At least nine months of interval data for all sites within an ERS Load are required for the Load to be eligible for the regression baseline evaluation methodology.  If one or more sites lack sufficient interval data, the ERS Load will either be evaluated using the control group baseline performance evaluation methodology or will be disqualified from participation as an ERS Load.
(ii)	Sites in an ERS Load assigned to the control group baseline are required to have fully functional interval metering in place at the start of an ERS Standard Contract Term, but are not required to have historical meter data prior to that time.
(iii)	If ERCOT determines that the residential ERS Load may be assigned to either baseline methodology, the QSE may select its preferred option.
(b)	If the ERS Load consists of non-residential sites, the ERS Load must qualify for at least one ERS default baseline methodology, as described in paragraph (2) above.
(c)	For an ERS Load assigned to the control group baseline, ERCOT will divide the aggregation into multiple randomly assigned numbered groups for purposes of testing and deployment event Dispatch, and one of these groups will be designated as the control group, to be held out of the test or event, at time of Dispatch.  All remaining ERS Loads will participate and be evaluated in each test or event relative to the control group.  ERCOT will strive to minimize control group size while preserving the ability to achieve accurate Demand response measurement and verification.  The number of groups, group size and group designations are subject to change if the QSE adjusts the population of the ERS Load during the ERS Standard Contract Term, as described in paragraph (15) of Section 3.14.3.1, Emergency Response Service Procurement.
(5)	All ESI IDs within an aggregated ERS Load must be on the same baseline methodology (either the ERS Default Baseline, or the ERS Alternate Baseline). 
8.1.3.1.2	Performance Evaluation for Emergency Response Service Generators
(1)	ERCOT shall evaluate the event performance of an ERS Generator by measuring net injection of energy to the ERCOT System using data from metering as described in paragraph (5)(a) of Section 3.14.3.3, Emergency Response Service Provision and Technical Requirements.
(2)	A Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS Load will be classified as co-located with an ERS Generator if each site in the ERS Load is physically located with a site in the ERS Generator, and if both the ERS Generator and the ERS Load are represented by the same QSE and are participating in the same ERS service type and Time Periods.  If separate offers are received from different QSEs, both offers will be rejected.  A Weather-Sensitive ERS Load is not eligible to be classified as co-located with an ERS Generator.
(3)	If an ERS Generator is co-located with an ERS Load the following shall apply:
(a)	If a default baseline has been selected by a QSE for ERS performance evaluation for an ERS Load that is co-located with an ERS Generator, event and test performance of the ERS Generator and ERS Load shall be evaluated jointly using interval data from the Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) installed metering. The joint performance will be attributed to both the ERS Load and ERS Generator.
(b) 	The self-serve capacity used to calculate availability in each ERS Time Period for the ERS Generator shall be deemed to be the lesser of the self-serve capacity specified on the offer or the peak Load of the ERS Load during that ERS Time Period over the 12 months preceding the beginning of the ERS Standard Contract Term.
(c)	If the co-located ERS Load is assigned to the ERS Alternate Baseline, the performance during an ERS deployment event or ERCOT test shall be evaluated using one of two methods selected by the QSE:
(i)	The QSE may elect to have the performance of the ERS Generator and ERS Load evaluated separately.  In this case:
(A)	All site Load must participate in the ERS Load and ERCOT shall calculate interval-by-interval values for the Load of each site in the ERS Load by adding the MWh output measured by the QSE-installed metering on the generator(s) at the site to the MWh consumption measured by the TDSP metering and by subtracting the MWh export from the site, as measured by the TDSP metering.  The performance of the ERS Load shall be evaluated using the ERCOT calculated values of the site Load.
(B)	The ERS Generator shall be evaluated using the interval data measured by the metering on the output of the generator(s) as required by paragraph (5)(a) of Section 3.14.3.3.  For purposes of determining ERS Generator performance, the injection capacity in each ERS Time Period for the ERS Generator shall be deemed to be the sum of self-serve capacity and injection capacity submitted on the offer for that ERS Time Period, and the self-serve capacity used to measure performance for that ERS Time Period shall be deemed to be zero. 
(ii)	The QSE may elect to have the performance of the ERS Generator and ERS Load evaluated jointly.  In this case, ERCOT shall use the TDSP metering installed for the performance evaluation.
(A)	If ERCOT determines that one of its established default baseline types accurately represents the ERS Load’s Demand response contribution, the contribution of the ERS Load to the joint performance shall be based on that response.
(B)	If ERCOT determines that none of its established default baseline types accurately represents the ERS Load’s Demand response contribution, the contribution of the ERS Load to the joint performance shall be deemed to be the product of the ERS Load’s obligation for the interval and the ERS Interval Performance Factor (EIPFi) as computed in Section 8.1.3.1.4, Event Performance Criteria for Emergency Response Service Resources.
(C)	The joint performance will be attributed to both the ERS Load and ERS Generator.
(4)	If the ERS Generator is not co-located with an ERS Load the following shall apply:
(a)	For purposes of determining ERS performance, the self-serve capacity used to measure performance in each time period for the ERS Generator shall be deemed to be zero and the injection capacity used to measure performance shall be equal to the amount submitted on the offer.
(b)	The ERS Generator shall have its performance based on its metered output to the ERCOT System as measured by the TDSP metering.
8.1.3.1.3	Availability Criteria for Emergency Response Service Resources
(1)	No later than 45 days after the end of an ERS Standard Contract Term, ERCOT shall provide each QSE representing ERS Resources with an availability report for its ERS portfolio for each ERS service type.  The report shall contain:
(a)	For each ERS Time Period and each ERS Contract Period in the ERS Standard Contract Term, the ERS availability factor (ERSAF) for each ERS Resource in the QSE’s ERS portfolio, as described in Sections 8.1.3.1.3.1, Time Period Availability Calculations for Emergency Response Service Loads, and 8.1.3.1.3.2, Time Period Availability Calculations for Emergency Response Service Generators.
(b)	For each ERS Contract Period in the ERS Standard Contract Term, the QSE’s portfolio-level availability factor, as described in Section 8.1.3.3, Payment Reductions and Suspension of Qualification of Emergency Response Service Resources and/or their Qualified Scheduling Entities.
(c)	The QSE’s portfolio-level availability factor for the Standard Contract Term, as described in Section 8.1.3.3. 
8.1.3.1.3.1	Time Period Availability Calculations for Emergency Response Service Loads
(1)	For an ERS Load on an ERS Default Baseline, ERCOT will calculate its ERSAF as follows:
(a)	ERCOT will consider the ERS Load to have been unavailable for a 15-minute interval in a contracted ERS Time Period in which any of the following apply:
(i) 	The interval Load of the ERS Load was less than 95% of its contracted ERS MW capacity; or
(ii)	Required metered interval data was not provided to ERCOT by the time ERCOT calculated availability for one or more sites in the ERS Resource.  
(b)  	Otherwise, the ERS Load will be considered available for that 15-minute interval.  The ERSAF will be the ratio of the number of 15-minute intervals the ERS Load was available during the ERS Time Period divided by the total number of 15-minute intervals in the ERS Time Period.
(c)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, in determining the ERSAF, ERCOT will exclude from the calculation the following contracted intervals: 
(i)	Any 15-minute interval in which the ERS Load was deployed during an ERS deployment event or unannounced test, including intervals that begin during the ten-hour ERS recovery period following the issuance of the recall instruction; and
(ii)	Any 15-minute interval following an ERS deployment resulting in exhaustion of the ERS Load’s obligation in an ERS Contract Period.
(2)	For an ERS Load assigned to the alternate baseline, ERCOT will calculate its ERSAF for an ERS Time Period using the following formula:
ERSAF qce(tp)d  = MIN (1, (AV qce(tp)d / (OFFERMW qce(tp)d)))
The above variables are defined as follows:
Variable	Unit	Description
AV qce(tp)d	MW	Average MW Load, calculated as the average of the actual interval MW values or the MW values determined in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) below, per 15-minute interval for an ERS Load in a contracted ERS Time Period per ERS service type d, excluding declared maximum base Load. 
OFFERMW qce(tp)d	MW	An ERS Load’s contracted capacity for an ERS Time Period, per ERS service type d, applicable to either competitively procured or self-provided ERS.
ERSAF qce(tp)d	None	Availability factor for an ERS Load for an ERS Time Period per ERS service type d.
q	None	A QSE.
c	None	ERS Contract Period.
e	None	An ERS Load.
tp	None	ERS Time Period.
d	None	ERS service type (Weather-Sensitive ERS-10, Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS-10, Weather -Sensitive ERS-30, or Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS-30).
(a)	If the ERS Load is co-located with an ERS Generator and the QSE has opted for separate evaluation, its Load, for purposes of availability calculations, shall be determined as specified in paragraph (3)(c) of Section 8.1.3.1.2, Performance Evaluation for Emergency Response Service Generators.  
(b) 	For purposes of calculating availability, the interval MW value will be deemed to be equal to the declared maximum base Load if the following condition is met:
(i)	Required metered interval data was not provided to ERCOT by the time ERCOT calculated availability for one or more sites in the ERS Resource.   
(c)	For purposes of calculating availability, ERCOT shall exclude from the average any 15-minute interval meeting one or more of the following descriptions:
(i)	Any 15-minute interval in which the ERS Load was deployed during an ERS deployment event or unannounced test, including intervals that begin during the ten-hour ERS recovery period following the issuance of the recall instruction; or
(ii)	Any 15-minute interval following the ERS deployment resulting in exhaustion of the ERS Load’s obligation in an ERS Contract Period.
(3)	A Weather-Sensitive ERS Load shall always have its availability factor for an ERS Contract Period set to 1.0 and its availability settlement weighting factor (ERSAFWT) set to zero.
8.1.3.1.3.2	Time Period Availability Calculations for Emergency Response Service Generators
(1)	ERCOT shall evaluate the availability of an ERS Generator by using data from 15-minute interval metering dedicated to the ERS Generator.
(2)	ERCOT will calculate an ERSAF using interval meter readings for an ERS Generator for each committed ERS Time Period as the ratio of the number of 15-minute intervals the ERS Generator was available in the ERS Time Period divided by the total number of obligated 15-minute intervals in the ERS Time Period.  ERS Generators are considered available for any 15-minute interval except the following:
(a)	An ERS Generator that is not co-located with an ERS Load will be considered unavailable for all 15-minute intervals that are part of an unsuccessful unannounced ERCOT test or event, as well as any subsequent intervals following the end of the test or event up to the interval immediately preceding the first full 15-minute interval for which the ERS Generator injects energy to the ERCOT System at a level greater than or equal to the sum of its injection capacity and obligation at the time of the test or event.  The success or lack of success of an unannounced ERCOT test or event is determined by the criteria specified in Section 8.1.3.2, Testing of Emergency Response Service Resources.
(b)	An ERS Generator that is co-located with an ERS Load and is being separately evaluated from the ERS Load will be considered unavailable for all 15-minute intervals that are part of an unsuccessful unannounced ERCOT test or event, as well as any subsequent intervals following the end of the test up to the interval immediately preceding the first full 15-minute interval for which the ERS Generator’s output energy is greater than or equal to  the sum of its injection capacity and obligation at the time of the test or event.  The success or lack of success of an unannounced ERCOT test or event is determined by the criteria specified in Section 8.1.3.2.
(c) 	An ERS Generator that is co-located with an ERS Load and is being evaluated jointly with the ERS Load will be considered unavailable for all 15-minute intervals that are part of an unsuccessful unannounced ERCOT test or event, as well as any subsequent intervals following the end of the test up to the interval immediately preceding the first full 15-minute interval for which the combined performance of the ERS Load and ERS Generator is greater than or equal to the combined obligation at the time of the test or event.  The success or lack of success of an unannounced ERCOT test or event is determined by the criteria specified in Section 8.1.3.2.   
(d)	An ERS Generator will be considered unavailable during any 15-minute interval of an obligated ERS Time Period in which any of the following conditions are present:
(i)	The ERS Generator output is greater than the sum of its self-serve capacity and its declared injection capacity for the ERS Time Period; 
(ii)	The export to the grid for the ERS Generator is greater than the injection capacity for the ERS Time Period; or
(iii)	Required metered interval data was not provided to ERCOT by the time ERCOT calculated availability for one or more sites in the ERS Resource.
(e)	ERCOT shall exclude any 15-minute intervals meeting one or more of the following descriptions from the availability: 
(i)	Any 15-minute interval in which the ERS Generator was deployed during an ERS deployment event or unannounced test, including intervals that begin during the ten-hour ERS recovery period following the issuance of the recall instruction; and
(ii)	15-minute intervals during a successfully completed ERCOT unannounced test of the ERS Generator including intervals that begin during the ten-hour ERS recovery period.
8.1.3.1.3.3	Contract Period Availability Calculations for Emergency Response Service Resources 
(1)	ERCOT shall compute a single time- and capacity-weighted availability factor (ERSAFCOMB) for each ERS Resource for an ERS Contract Period from the ERS Time Period ERSAFs calculated in Sections 8.1.3.1.1, Baselines for Emergency Response Service Loads, and 8.1.3.1.3.2, Time Period Availability Calculations for Emergency Response Service Generators, as follows:
If HOURS qce(tp)d = 0, ERSAFCOMB qced = 1
Otherwise
ERSAFCOMB qced =   (HOURS qce(tp)d * OFFERMW qce(tp)d * ERSAF qce(tp)d) /   (HOURS qce(tp)d * OFFERMW qce(tp)d)
The above variables are defined as follows:
Variable	Unit	Description
ERSAFCOMB qced	None	Time- and capacity-weighted availability factor for an ERS Contract Period per ERS service type d.
HOURS qce(tp)d	Hours	The number of hours an ERS Resource is obligated in an ERS Time Period per ERS service type d minus any hours in that Time Period excluded for purposes of computing availability.
OFFERMW qce(tp)d	MWh	The ERS Resource’s contracted capacity for that time period per ERS service type d expressed in units of MWh.
ERSAF qce(tp)d	None	Availability factor for an ERS Resource for an ERS Time Period and per ERS service type d.
q	None	A QSE.
c	None	ERS Contract Period.
e	None	Individual ERS Resource.
tp	None	ERS Time Period.
d 	None	ERS service type (Weather-Sensitive ERS-10, Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS-10, Weather-Sensitive ERS-30, or Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS-30).
(2)	In an ERS Contract Period with no ERS deployment events, the ERSAFWT for all ERS Resources shall be set to 1.0. 
(3)	In an ERS Contract Period with one or more ERS deployment events and in which no ERS Resource’s ERS obligation is exhausted, the ERSAFWT for deployed ERS Resources shall be set to 0.25 and the ERSAFWT for all undeployed ERS Resources shall be set to 1.0.
(4)	If, pursuant to Section 3.14.3.1, Emergency Response Service Procurement, an ERS Contract Period is shorter than the associated ERS Standard Contract Term the following shall apply:
(a)	For all deployed ERS Resources, the ERSAFWT of the exhausted or discontinued ERS Resource shall be set to 0.25 × ERSAFHRS qced with ERSAFHRS qced determined as calculated in paragraph (c) below.  
(b)	For all ERS Resources with no deployments during the ERS Contract Period, ERSAFWT shall be set to 1.0.
(c)	ERSAFHRSqced for the ERS Contract Period shall be calculated using the following formula:
ERSAFHRS qced = AFHOURS qced /  HOURS qse(tp)d
The above variables are defined as follows:
Variable	Unit	Description
ERSAFHRS qced	None	The ratio of Availability Factor Hours (AFHOURS qced) to the total awarded hours in the ERS Standard Contract Term s for ERS Resource e per ERS service type d.
AFHOURS qced  	Hours	The total number of the ERS Resource’s obligated hours in ERS Contract Period c, minus any hours during that time excluded for purposes of computing availability.

tp	None	ERS Time Period.
d 	None	ERS service type (Weather-Sensitive ERS-10, Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS-10, Weather-Sensitive ERS-30, or Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS-30).
(d)	An ERS Resource shall be deemed to have met its availability requirements for an ERS Contract Period if ERSAFHRS for the ERS Contract Period is less than 0.5 and if the ERS Resource achieves an ERSAFCOMB greater than or equal to the value calculated in the formula below:
3.8 * ERSAFHRS qced – 3.8 * (ERSAFHRS qced)2
(e)	An ERS Resource that is deemed to have met its availability requirements under paragraph (d) above shall have its availability factor for that ERS Contract Period set to 1.0.
8.1.3.1.4	Event Performance Criteria for Emergency Response Service Resources
(1)	No later than 45 days after the end of an ERS Standard Contract Term in which one or more ERS deployment events occurred, ERCOT shall provide each QSE representing ERS Resources with an event performance report containing the results of ERCOT’s evaluation of the event(s).  The report shall contain:
(a)	For each event, the ERS event performance factor (ERSEPF) for each ERS Resource in the QSE’s ERS portfolio, as described in this Section;
(b)	For each event, the QSE’s portfolio-level event performance factor, as described in Section 8.1.3.3, Payment Reductions and Suspension of Qualification of Emergency Response Service Resources and/or their Qualified Scheduling Entities;
(c)	The QSE’s portfolio-level event performance factor for the ERS Standard Contract Term, as described in Section 8.1.3.3. 
(2)	An ERS Resource’s performance shall not be evaluated for an ERS deployment if one of the following is true:
(a) 	The Resource is in a ten-hour recovery period following a prior deployment at the beginning of the sustained response period of the deployment;
(b)	The ERS Resource does not have an obligation for at least one full interval during the Sustained Response Period of that event;
(c)	For Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS Resources, one or more sites of an ERS Resource were disabled or unverifiable due to events on the TDSP side of the meter affecting the supply, delivery or measurement of electricity either during the event or prior that impacts the creation of a credible baseline.  QSEs must provide verification of such events from the TDSP or Meter Reading Entity (MRE); or
(d)	For Weather-Sensitive ERS Resources, 10% or more sites of an ERS Load were disabled or unverifiable due to events on the TDSP side of the meter affecting the supply, delivery or measurement of electricity either during the event or prior that impacts the creation of a credible baseline.
(3)	Otherwise, ERCOT shall evaluate an ERS Resource’s performance during an ERS deployment based on the following criteria:
(a)	Within the applicable ramp period, ERS Loads shall curtail Load and ERS Generators shall output energy and reach a level of energy injection to the ERCOT System in accordance with their ERS contractual obligations.  The ramp period for ERS Resources in ERS-10 is ten minutes.  The ramp period for ERS Resources in ERS-30 is 30 minutes.
(b)	An ERS Load on a default baseline is expected to not increase its Load during the ramp period prior to an ERS test or deployment event.  ERCOT will deem repeated occurrences of such Load increases to be a violation of the Protocols. 
(c)	ERCOT shall measure each ERS Resource’s performance throughout the duration of an ERS deployment event by analyzing 15-minute interval meter data associated with the ERS Resource.  ERCOT will compute an ERSEPF for each ERS Resource based upon this analysis.  
(i)	The ERSEPF is computed as the time-weighted arithmetic average of the EIPFs for the Sustained Response Period.  An EIPF is computed for the ERS Resource for each of the 15-minute intervals in an ERS Sustained Response Period for which the ERS Resource has contracted capacity.  If the last interval of the Sustained Response Period has an interval fraction (IntFrac) of less than one, the EIPF for that interval shall be excluded for the computation of ERSEPF.  For an interval, EIPFi is computed as follows:
EIPF i 	= 	Max(Min(((Base_MWh i – Actual_MWh i) / (IntFrac i * OFFERMW)),1),0)
The above variables are defined as follows:
Variable	Unit	Description
IntFrac i	None	Interval fraction for that ERS Resource for that interval.
Base_MWh i	MWh	For an ERS Load on a default baseline, the aggregated sum of baseline MWh values estimated by ERCOT for all sites in the ERS Load for that interval.
For an ERS Load assigned to the alternate baseline, the sum of the ERS Load’s OFFERMW and maximum base Load for that interval.
For a stand-alone ERS Generator or an ERS Generator co-located and jointly evaluated with an ERS Load, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System for that interval.
For an ERS Generator co-located with, but evaluated separately from an ERS Load, the energy output of the ERS Generator.
Actual_MWh i	MWh	For an ERS Load, the aggregated sum of the actual MWh values for all sites in the ERS Load for that interval.
For an ERS Generator, the ERS Generator’s declared injection capacity, expressed in units of MWh.
OFFERMW	MWh	The ERS Resource’s contracted capacity for that interval expressed in units of MWh.
i	None	An interval.
	and where IntFrac i corresponds to the fraction of time for that interval for which the Sustained Response Period is in effect and is computed as follows:
IntFrac i = (CEndT i – CBegT i) / 15
The above variables are defined as follows: 
Variable	Unit	Description
IntFrac i	None	Interval fraction for that ERS Resource for that interval.
CBegT i	Minutes	If the Sustained Response Period begins after the start of that interval, the time in minutes from the beginning of that interval to the beginning of the Sustained Response Period, otherwise it is zero.
CEndT i	Minutes	If the Sustained Response Period ends during that interval, the time in minutes from the beginning of that interval to the end of the Sustained Response Period, otherwise it is 15.
i	None	An interval.
(ii)	For an ERS Load assigned to an alternate baseline, if the IntFrac for the first interval of the Sustained Response Period is less than one, the EIPF for that interval shall be calculated as follows:  
(A)	If the actual Load of the full 15-minute interval is less than the maximum base Load, the EIPF for that interval shall be set to one.
(B)	If the QSE submits interval data for the day of the event that is more granular than at the 15-minute interval level that shows the average Load for the ERS Resource was below its maximum base Load for the portion of the interval in the Sustained Response Period, the EIPF for that interval shall be set to one.  This submitted data must be in a format acceptable to ERCOT and include, at a minimum, the actual Load and associated time stamps.
(C)	If the QSE submits other documentary evidence that ERCOT determines, in its discretion, demonstrates the average Load for the ERS Resource was below its maximum base Load for the portion of the interval in the Sustained Response Period, the EIPF for that interval shall be set to one.  The documentary evidence must be supported by a sworn affidavit.
(D)	If none of the above applies, then ERCOT shall calculate EIPF using the formula in subsection (i) above with Base_MWhi determined using one of the baselines described in the document titled “Demand Response Baseline Methodologies” on ERCOT.com.
(iii)	In any ERS Standard Contract Term in which ERCOT has deployed ERS, the ERSEPF for an ERS Resource shall be the time-weighted average of the event performance factors for all events for which the ERS Resource was deployed. 
(iv)	Irrespective of its ERSEPF, an ERS Resource shall be deemed to have met its event performance requirements if it is an ERS Load determined by ERCOT to have met its Load reduction obligations in the ERS deployment event if measured on one of ERCOT’s established default baseline types other than the baseline type selected by the QSE, and ERCOT determines that the different baseline more accurately represents the ERS Load’s Demand response contribution.
(4)	For an ERS deployment event, ERCOT shall calculate EIPFs and an ERSEPF for a Weather-Sensitive ERS Load, using actual 15-minute interval meter data, or, for Distributed Renewable Generation (DRG) that has been designated by the QSE to be evaluated by using its native load calculated 15-minute interval native load data, consistent with the provisions of paragraph (3)(c)(i) above.  No other provisions in paragraph (3) above shall apply to Weather-Sensitive ERS Loads.
(5)	Regardless of the number of enrolled sites in the Weather-Sensitive ERS Load at the time of an event or test, the contracted capacity value (OFFERMW) used will be the value submitted by the QSE in its offer.
8.1.3.2	Testing of Emergency Response Service Resources
(1)	ERCOT may conduct an unannounced test of any ERS Resource at any time during an ERS Time Period in which the ERS Resource is contracted to provide ERS.  Prior to the beginning of a Standard Contract Term, a QSE may request that one or more of its ERS Resources awarded in ERS-30 be tested as if subject to a ten-minute ramp during that ERS Standard Contract Term.  The duration of a test will not count toward the ERS Resource’s maximum cumulative deployment time for an ERS Contract Period.  
(a)	For Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS Resources, ERCOT shall determine a test performance factor for each test using the methodology defined in Section 8.1.3.1.4, Event Performance Criteria for Emergency Response Service Resources.  
(i)	The test performance factors for Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS Resources resulting from those tests will be used in Settlement for that and subsequent ERS Standard Contract Terms as specified in Section 8.1.3.3, Payment Reductions and Suspension of Qualification of Emergency Response Service Resources and/or their Qualified Scheduling Entities.  
(ii)	A test shall be deemed to be successful if the ERS Resource achieves both a test performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an EIPF for the full first interval of the test of 0.95 or greater.  
(iii)	An ERS Resource for which the most recent test with a ten-minute ramp was successful shall not be subject to a test for at least 330 days regardless of whether the ERS Resource is participating in ERS-10 or ERS-30.  
(iv)	An ERS Resource for which the most recent test with a 30-minute ramp was successful shall not be subject to a test for at least 330 days unless the ERS Resource participates in ERS-10 during that period.  
(v)	An ERS Resource participating in ERS-10 that meets its ERS-10 performance obligations for all ERS deployment events by achieving both an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an EIPF for the full first interval of 0.95 or greater during an ERS Standard Contract Term shall not be subject to a test for ERS-10 or ERS-30 for at least 330 calendar days following the date of the last deployment of ERS-10 during that ERS Standard Contract Term.  
(vi)	An ERS Resource participating in ERS-30 that meets its ERS-30 performance obligations for all ERS deployment events by achieving both an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an EIPF for the full first interval of 0.95 or greater during an ERS Standard Contract Term shall not be subject to a test for ERS-30 for at least 330 calendar days following the date of the last deployment of ERS-30 during that ERS Standard Contract Term.  
(vii)	Notwithstanding the foregoing:
(A)	If the ERSAFCOMB for an ERS Resource for an ERS Standard Contract Term consisting of a single ERS Contract Period is less than 0.85, or the ERSAFCOMB for an ERS Resource for an ERS Contract Period with a duration that is less than an ERS Standard Contract Term is lower than the threshold specified in paragraph (4)(d) of Section 8.1.3.1.3.3, Contract Period Availability Calculations for Emergency Response Service Resources, ERCOT may re-test that ERS Resource without regard to the 330 day
