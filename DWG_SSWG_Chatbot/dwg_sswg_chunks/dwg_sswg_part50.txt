wind and solar data of the past 18 months
a.	Monthly report on uncurtailed generation estimate data is posted on the WMWG meeting page each month
https://www.ercot.com/committees/wms/wmwg 
2.	Remove hours where uncurtailed wind or solar capacity output is less than 50%
3.	Sum the hourly uncurtailed wind and solar capacity output
4.	Find the penetration of the sum of the hourly uncurtailed wind and solar capacity output to system load during the hour (sum/load)
5.	Rank the hours by the penetration percentage from the previous step from highest to lowest and select the top twenty hours
6.	Find the average estimated uncurtailed renewable output (wind output + solar output respectively) from the top twenty hours
7.	Calculate the average ERCOT load in the top 20 hours
8.	Take the average estimated uncurtailed renewable output and divide it by the average ERCOT load in the top 20 hours to get the average uncurtailed renewable penetration of the top 20 hours for wind and solar respectively
