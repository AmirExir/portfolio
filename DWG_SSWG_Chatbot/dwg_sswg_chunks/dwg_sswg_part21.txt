tic and dynamic reactive resources and transformer settings via a Device Control Profile for each case.  Scheduled bus voltages are maintained by the TSPs and submitted via Device Control Profiles as well.  TSPs can suggest different generator reactive limits Qmax and Qmin for ERCOT to submit in the Load Generation Profiles and should submit data to collaborate the need for the change such as historical unit operation and biennial reactive tests.  ERCOT will submit the change and follow-up with the RE and TSP to determine any Resource Registration Data modifications.
•	If the TSPs identify errors with generator data or RE topology, the TSPs will notify ERCOT staff in accordance with the identified NMMS process.  This process entails email notification to the TSP of a Resource Registration Data change in their footprint and posting of updated Resource Registration Data data on the Citrix NMMS_POSTINGS area of the ERCOT Market Information System.
•	Review and resolve all inconsistencies
