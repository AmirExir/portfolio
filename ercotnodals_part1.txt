1	OVERVIEW
1.1	Summary of the ERCOT Protocols Document
(1)	The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) Protocols, created through the collaborative efforts of representatives of all segments of Market Participants, means the document adopted by ERCOT, including any attachments or exhibits referenced in these Protocols, as amended from time to time, that contains the scheduling, operating, planning, reliability, and Settlement (including Customer registration) policies, rules, guidelines, procedures, standards, and criteria of ERCOT.  To determine responsibilities at a given time, the version of the ERCOT Protocols in effect at the time of the performance or non-performance of an action governs with respect to that action.  These Protocols are intended to implement ERCOT’s functions as the Independent Organization for the ERCOT Region as certified by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) and as the Program Administrator appointed by the PUCT that is responsible for carrying out the administrative responsibilities related to the Renewable Energy Credit (REC) Program as set forth in subsection (h) of P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.173, Renewable Energy Credit Program.  Market Participants, the Independent Market Monitor (IMM), and ERCOT shall abide by these Protocols. 
(2)	The ERCOT Board, Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), and other ERCOT subcommittees authorized by the ERCOT Board or TAC or ERCOT may develop polices, guidelines, procedures, forms, and applications for the implementation of and operation under, these Protocols and to comply with applicable rules, laws, and orders of a Governmental Authority.  A policy, guideline, procedure, form, or application described above is an “Other Binding Document.”  Other Binding Documents do not include ERCOT’s internal administrative procedures, documents and processes necessary to fulfill its role as the Independent Organization or as a registered Entity with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). 
(3)	ERCOT shall post the Other Binding Documents List and all Other Binding Documents to a part of the ERCOT website reserved for posting Other Binding Documents.  A TAC designated subcommittee shall review the Other Binding Documents List at least every four years, and modifications to the Other Binding Documents List shall be reviewed and considered by the TAC designated subcommittee and by TAC at its next scheduled meeting.  
(4)	Any revision of an Other Binding Document must follow the revision process set forth in that Other Binding Document.  If an Other Binding Document does not specify a revision process, the Other Binding Document shall be subject to the procedures in Section 21, Revision Request Process, and shall be treated as if it were a Protocol for purposes of the revision process.  
(5)	To the extent that Other Binding Documents are not in conflict with these Protocols or with an Agreement to which it is a party, each Market Participant, the IMM, and ERCOT shall abide by the Other Binding Documents.  Taken together, these Protocols and the Other Binding Documents constitute all of the “scheduling, operating, planning, reliability, and Settlement policies, rules, guidelines, and procedures established by the independent System Operator in ERCOT,” as that phrase is used in subsection (j) of the Public Utility Regulatory Act, TEX. UTIL. CODE ANN. § 39.151 (Vernon 1998 & Supp. 2007) (PURA), Essential Organizations, that bind Market Participants.
(6)	Except as provided below, if the provisions in any attachment to these Protocols or in any of the Other Binding Documents conflict with the provisions of Section 1, Overview, through Section 21, and Section 24, Retail Point to Point Communications, through Section 27, Securitization Uplift Charges, then the provisions of Section 1 through Section 21, and Section 24 through Section 27 prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.  If any provision of any Agreement conflicts with any provision of the Protocols, the Agreement prevails to the extent of the conflict.  Any Agreement provision that deviates from the standard form for that Agreement in Section 22, Attachments, must expressly state that the Agreement provision deviates from the standard form in Section 22.  Agreement provisions that deviate from the Protocols are effective only upon approval by the ERCOT Board on a showing of good cause.   
(7)	These Protocols are not intended to govern the direct relationships between or among Market Participants except as expressly provided in these Protocols.  ERCOT is not responsible for any relationship between or among Market Participants to which ERCOT is not a party.
1.2	Functions of ERCOT
(1)	ERCOT is the Independent Organization certified by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) for the ERCOT Region. The major functions of ERCOT, as the Independent Organization, are to: 
(a)	Ensure access to the ERCOT Transmission Grid and distribution systems for all buyers and sellers of electricity on nondiscriminatory terms; 
(b)	Ensure the reliability and adequacy of the ERCOT Transmission Grid;
(c)	Ensure that information relating to a Customer’s choice of Retail Electric Provider (REP) in Texas is conveyed in a timely manner to the persons who need that information; and
(d)	Ensure that electricity production and delivery are accurately accounted for among the Generation Resources and Settlement Only Generators (SOGs) and wholesale buyers and sellers, and Transmission Service Providers (TSPs) and Distribution Service Providers (DSPs), in the ERCOT Region.
[NPRR995:  Replace paragraph (d) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(d)	Ensure that electricity production and delivery are accurately accounted for among wholesale buyers and sellers, and Transmission Service Providers (TSPs) and Distribution Service Providers (DSPs), in the ERCOT Region.

The request shall also include a statement of how long the ECEII designation should apply to the information and support for the period proposed.  ERCOT shall consider any submitted justification before determining whether the information qualifies as ECEII.  ERCOT shall not disclose or permit disclosure of any information protected from disclosure pursuant to law, regulation, or order.  ERCOT shall notify the submitter of its determination within five Business Days after receiving the submission.  ERCOT shall continue to treat as ECEII information originally claimed to be ECEII for five Business Days following the date ERCOT notified the submitter of its determination.  A determination by ERCOT not to classify information as ECEII is subject to review by the PUCT as set forth in Section 1.3.8, Commission Review of ERCOT Determinations Regarding Protected Information or ERCOT Critical Energy Infrastructure Information Status.

(p)	Incidentally as part of a tour of the ERCOT control room provided to persons determined by ERCOT to be eligible to participate in the tour.  Prior to accessing the ERCOT control room, such persons must sign a nondisclosure agreement required by ERCOT and comply with the screening and other requirements provided in a policy adopted by ERCOT security.  The policy will include a prohibition against taking photographs or recordings of Protected Information or ECEII.  This subsection does not apply to a person who is a director, officer, employee, agent, representative, contractor, or consultant of a Market Participant that is registered with ERCOT as one or more of the following registration types: Resource Entity, QSE, LSE, or CRR Account Holder. 
(2)	Protected Information may not be disclosed to other Market Participants prior to ten days following the Operating Day under review, except as permitted in paragraph (1)(n) above.
(3)	ERCOT may disclose, and may authorize a Receiving Party or Creating Party to disclose, ECEII to the public or to any person under the provisions of this paragraph, except for ECEII otherwise protected from disclosure pursuant to law, regulation, or order. 
(a)	ERCOT may propose to disclose ECEII that is not otherwise protected from disclosure pursuant to law, regulation, or order.  Any Receiving Party or Creating Party other than ERCOT may request ERCOT authorization to disclose such ECEII.
(i)	ERCOT may propose to disclose ECEII that is not otherwise protected from disclosure pursuant to law, regulation, or order if it determines that the public benefit of the proposed disclosure of ECEII outweighs the potential harm resulting from the disclosure.  ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice regarding ERCOT’s intent to disclose the ECEII, subject to objection as further provided in paragraph (c) below. 
(ii)	A request by a Receiving Party or Creating Party other than ERCOT for authorization to disclose ECEII shall be submitted by e-mail to ERCOT’s General Counsel.  If the ECEII is not otherwise protected from disclosure pursuant to law, regulation, or order, and ERCOT determines that the public benefit of the proposed disclosure of ECEII outweighs the potential harm resulting from the disclosure, ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice authorizing the ECEII to be disclosed, subject to objection as further provided in paragraph (c) below.  ERCOT shall make such a determination no later than five Business Days following the date it receives the request.
(b)	The Market Notice issued pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) above shall identify the ECEII to be disclosed; the party requesting the disclosure; the public benefit justifying the proposed disclosure; the date on which the information may be disclosed, which shall be no sooner than five Business Days following the date of the Market Notice; and, if the proposed disclosure is not to the public, the persons to whom ECEII would be disclosed.  The authorization shall be effective unless a Market Participant submits an objection pursuant to paragraph (c) below.  
(c)	Any Market Participant may submit written objections to the proposed disclosure.  Such objections shall be submitted by e-mail to ERCOT’s General Counsel no later than the end of the fourth Business Day following the issuance of the Market Notice described in paragraph (b) above.  Failure to object to the proposed allowance of ECEII disclosure pursuant to this paragraph shall constitute a waiver of any such objection for all purposes.  ERCOT shall provide notice of the objection to the party requesting authorization to disclose ECEII no later than the end of the Business Day following receipt of the objection.  The party requesting authorization to disclose ECEII shall not disclose the ECEII if it has been notified of any objection pursuant to this paragraph unless and until ERCOT issues a second Market Notice authorizing disclosure, as provided in paragraph (d) below.  
(d)	If one or more objections to disclosure is submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) above, ERCOT shall issue a second Market Notice describing each such objection and stating whether the objection affects ERCOT’s determination as to the proposed disclosure of ECEII.  If ERCOT determines that the ECEII should still be disclosed notwithstanding these objections, the second Market Notice shall establish the date on which the ECEII may be disclosed, which shall be no sooner than the fifth Business Day following the issuance of the second Market Notice.  ERCOT’s determination in the second Market Notice is a final decision that may be challenged at the PUCT without using the processes described in Section 20, Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedure and Procedure for Return of Settlement Funds.  If ERCOT authorizes a non-public disclosure of ECEII, the party disclosing the ECEII shall require each recipient of ECEII to enter into a nondisclosure agreement that includes the restrictions against disclosure described in Section 1.3.2, ERCOT Critical Energy Infrastructure Information, as a condition for obtaining the ECEII.
(e)	Notwithstanding anything in this Section, ERCOT may disclose ECEII to any federal, state or local government official without issuing a Market Notice if ERCOT determines that such disclosure is necessary to facilitate the government official’s public duties and that the delay associated with providing the Notice otherwise required by this paragraph (3) would impair that government official’s ability to take action to address a public emergency.  As soon as practicable, but no later than 24 hours following the disclosure:
(i)	ERCOT shall provide Notice to the Disclosing Party and all Market Participants materially impacted by the disclosure; and
(ii)	ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice describing the disclosure, unless ERCOT determines that such a Notice could jeopardize public safety or welfare, in which case no Notice is required.
(iii)	Each Disclosing Party, other than ERCOT, shall provide Notice to each Creating Party whose information has been disclosed pursuant to this paragraph (e).
(f)	Notwithstanding anything in this Section, any Receiving Party or Creating Party other than ERCOT may disclose ECEII to any federal, state or local government official without requesting prior authorization from ERCOT if the Receiving Party or Creating Party determines that such disclosure is necessary to facilitate the government official’s public duties and that the delay associated with requesting prior ERCOT authorization as otherwise required by this paragraph (3) would impair that government official’s ability to take action to address a public emergency.  
(i)	The Receiving Party or Creating Party shall provide Notice to ERCOT and all Market Participants materially impacted by the disclosure as soon as practicable, but no later than 24 hours following the disclosure.
(ii)	ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice describing the disclosure as soon as practicable, but no later than 24 hours following receipt of notice from the Receiving Party or Creating Party, unless ERCOT determines that such a Notice could jeopardize public safety or welfare, in which case no Notice is required.
1.3.7	Specific Performance 
(1)	It will be impossible or very difficult to measure in monetary terms the damages that would accrue due to any breach by Receiving Party of Section 1.3, Confidentiality, or any failure to perform any obligation contained in Section 1.3 and, for that reason, among others, a Disclosing Party affected by a disclosure or threatened disclosure is entitled to specific performance of Section 1.3.  In the event that a Disclosing Party institutes any proceeding to enforce any part of Section 1.3, the affected Receiving Party, by entering any agreement incorporating these Protocols, now waives any claim or defense that an adequate remedy at law exists for such a breach.
1.3.8	Commission Review of ERCOT Determinations Regarding Protected Information or ERCOT Critical Energy Infrastructure Information Status 
(1)	A determination by ERCOT that one or more items are or are not Protected Information or ECEII, or that the public benefit of the proposed disclosure of ECEII outweighs the potential harm resulting from the disclosure, is a final decision that may be challenged at the PUCT without using the processes described in Section 20, Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedure and Procedure for Return of Settlement Funds.  Any Entity materially affected by ERCOT’s determination shall, as a condition for seeking relief at the PUCT, notify ERCOT’s General Counsel no later than 1700 Central Prevailing Time (CPT) on the date five Business Days following the date ERCOT notified the submitter of its determination and shall file any complaint against ERCOT no later than 35 days following the date of the final decision, pursuant to P.U.C. PROC. R. 22.251, Review of Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) Conduct.  If an Entity materially affected by ERCOT’s determination notifies ERCOT that it is challenging ERCOT’s determination and files a complaint no later than 35 days following the ERCOT determination, ERCOT shall not disclose the information until the PUCT issues a final order authorizing such release.
1.4	Operational Audit
1.4.1	Materials Subject to Audit
(1)	ERCOT’s records and documentation pertaining to its operation as the certified Independent Organization for the ERCOT Region are subject to audit in the manner prescribed herein.  The rights of Market Participants to audit ERCOT are limited to the provisions in Section 1.4, Operational Audit.

1.4.3.2	Material Issues
(1)	The audits performed under Section 1.4.3.1, Audits to be Performed,  may also include material issues raised by ERCOT Members and/or Market Participants if:
(a)	Such issues have been presented to TAC, approved by TAC and approved by the ERCOT F&A Committee for inclusion in the audit scope; or 
(b)	Such issues are part of a random sample of complaints selected by the auditors for review, and affected Market Participants have agreed in writing to the examination of their related information in the compliance audit.
(2)	Members and Market Participants shall send any requests regarding such issues to the ERCOT TAC Chairperson designee identified on the MIS for inclusion on the TAC agenda.
1.4.4	Audit Results
(1)	Unless a longer time frame is reasonably necessary (e.g., for the market Settlements SOC audit, which is performed over a significant period of time), each audit report will be prepared and finalized no later than four months after the initiation of the audit.  Results of all audits performed pursuant to this Section shall be reported to the ERCOT F&A Committee.  These audits will be filed with the PUCT in accordance with PUCT Rules.  ERCOT may file an audit as confidential and Protected Information in order to protect Protected Information and other confidential or sensitive information therein.  Findings and recommended actions identified as a result of an audit will be reviewed by the ERCOT F&A Committee. The results of the audits required by this Section and the recommended actions to be taken by ERCOT shall be provided to ERCOT Members and Market Participants upon request to the extent these items do not contain Protected Information or other confidential or sensitive information.  
1.4.5	Availability of Records
(1)	Subject to the requirements of Section 1.4.6, Confidentiality of Information, ERCOT will provide the ERCOT Internal Audit Department, and/or the Appointed Firm and any other staff augmentation resources full and complete access to all financial books, cost statements, accounting records, and all documentation pertaining to the requirements of the specific audits being performed.  ERCOT will retain records relating to audits until the records retention requirements of ERCOT are satisfied; or until the audit issues are fully resolved, whichever is the later.  Such retention shall be a term of not less than four years and not be required for more than seven years.  This Section 1.4, Operational Audit, is not intended to require ERCOT to create any new records, reports, studies, or evaluations.
1.4.6	Confidentiality of Information
