Methodology for Calculating Wind Generation levels in the SSWG Cases

Goal – Use available forecast data to set the dispatch for wind generation in the new SSWG Cases.

Section 3.2.6.2.2 of the Nodal Procotols 

WINDPEAKPCT s, r	%	Seasonal Peak Average Wind Capacity as a Percent of Installed Capacity—The average wind capacity available for the summer and winter Peak Load Seasons s and region r, divided by the installed capacity for region r, expressed as a percentage. The Seasonal Peak Average, derived from Settlement data, is first calculated as the average capacity during the 20 highest system-wide peak Load hours for a given year’s summer and winter Peak Load Seasons. The final value is the average of the previous ten eligible years of Seasonal Peak Average values. Eligible years include 2009 through the most recent year for which COP data is available for the summer and winter Peak Load Seasons.  If the number of eligible years is less than ten, the average shall be based on the numbe
