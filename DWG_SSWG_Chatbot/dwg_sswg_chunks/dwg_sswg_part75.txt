ity in performing contingency studies on SSWG Cases.  When set up correctly, where automatic low-side load rollover occurs, hundreds of contingencies can be analyzed and reported within minutes.

4.4.3	Coordination of Tie Lines 
A tie line is defined as any transmission circuit with multiple owners represented within the context of the transmission circuit’s associated facility.  As used here, a transmission circuit’s associated facility includes all terminal buses as well as the transmission branch, transformer, bus section, or another electrical component connecting systems together.  For a tie line, each of the interconnected entities (TSP/TSP or TSP/RE) owns one or more elements of the tie line’s associated facility.

Careful coordination and discussion is required among SSWG members to verify all modeled tie line data.  Even in situations where no new tie lines are added to a network model, there could be many tie line changes.  Construction timing for future points of interconnec
