d be verified from field data and actual values entered into the power flow model.  A simple check can be utilized to verify certain modeling parameters for overhead lines.  The following equation is an approximation that applies to transmission lines that are completely overhead or assuming    MVA then


 

 
4.4.2	Multi-Section Line Grouping 
A multi-section line is defined as a grouping of several previously defined branches into one long circuit having several sub-sections or segments. 

Example: Two circuits exist (Figure 1) which originate at the same substation (4001) and terminate at the same substation (4742).  Each circuit has a tap to Substation A and a tap to Substation B.  If a fault occurs or maintenance requires an outage of Circuit 09, the circuit would be out-of-service between bus 4001 and bus 4742 including the taps to buses 4099 and 4672.  The loads normally served by these taps would be served by means of low-side rollover to buses 4100 and 4671 on Circuit 21.  Thi
