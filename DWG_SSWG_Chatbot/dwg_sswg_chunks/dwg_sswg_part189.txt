o a nominal position appropriate for the initial POI voltage and real power dispatch.
	Any switching controls that are expected to provide a response within 20 seconds (e.g. automatic switched shunts or on-load transformer tap changers) should be reflected in the dynamic model for the resource. 
	Aggregate Generation Resources, such as wind and solar, should be represented by a single equivalent aggregate model per registered Resource (i.e. allowed aggregation) and include a representation for the collector impedance and pad-mount transformer.  All dynamic control systems should be modeled (generator, exciter, governor, power system stabilizer, automatic voltage regulator, power plant controller, voltage and frequency protection, etc. as applicable).
	PSCAD models are not required to be aggregated to match resource registration.  However, PSS/E and TSAT models must match registration.
	Simulations should be run for a minimum of 20 seconds and show that the facility response has stabili
