When I re-ran the study with the full set, I noticed that several units were failing the flat-start and dynamic response portions of the MOD tests \u2014 including oscillations in the excitation and governor responses that did not match expected behavior.\nTask: My task was to identify the root cause of the failed validation and guide the customer toward correcting their model so it would pass both the reactive power (excitation) and turbine/governor response tests. This required careful analysis to determine whether the issue stemmed from data input, model parameterization, or the simulation setup itself.\nAction: I re-examined their DYRE file line by line and compared it to the validated versions used in ERCOT\u2019s Dynamics Working Group (DWG) base cases. I found that one of the key parameters in their model had the opposite sign from what it should have been \u2014 causing the oscillations and failed results. I communicated my findings to the customer, explaining the likely root cause and confirming whether the negative sign was intentional. To ensure the validity of my approach, I performed the same series of tests on another plant model that had passed verification previously, and the results matched perfectly. Once the customer corrected the sign and provided an updated DYRE file, I re-ran the study and confirmed that all validation tests passed successfully.\nResult: The corrected model passed both MOD-26 and MOD-27 requirements on the next attempt, saving the customer from further delays and compliance issues. By independently verifying the methodology on another plant, I built confidence in both the accuracy of our testing process and the integrity of our validation results. The customer expressed strong appreciation for my thoroughness and clear technical communication, and the project was used as a best-practice example for future dynamic model validations.",

However, our process for generating P3 and P6 contingencies was highly manual \u2014 we had to visually inspect the network, select pairs of elements by trial and error, and run multiple iterations to find all possible violations. To ensure completeness, my colleagues and I were asked to perform these studies independently and then cross-verify our results, which was both time-consuming and inefficient.\nTask: My goal was to improve the efficiency and consistency of this analysis by automating the generation of P3 and P6 contingencies, ensuring that no potential violations were missed while saving analyst time and effort.\nAction: I developed a Python-based automation tool that systematically created all possible P3 and P6 contingencies by defining the appropriate subsystem size and generating every valid combination of two elements within that boundary. The tool automatically fed these contingencies into PSS\u00aeE for evaluation and extracted the resulting thermal and voltage violations. I tested the tool across multiple cases to confirm its accuracy and compared its outputs with manually generated studies to verify completeness. The results showed that my tool identified additional contingencies and violations that manual reviews had missed.\nResult: The automation tool significantly improved the speed and thoroughness of our contingency analysis process. It reduced manual effort, eliminated redundant cross-verifications among engineers, and increased confidence in the completeness of the study results. The tool was later adopted by other engineers in our group as part of the standard workflow, becoming a key resource for improving consistency and efficiency in N-1 contingency analysis.",

    "text": "Principle: Invent and Simplify / Think Big / Customer Obsession\nQuestion: Tell me about a time when you created a tool or solution that made complex information easier to access or use.\nSituation: In ERCOT planning and operations, engineers often rely on lengthy documents such as the Nodal Protocols, Planning Guides, Resource Integration Handbook, and DWG/SSWG procedure manuals. These documents contain thousands of pages of technical requirements and standards that are essential for studies, compliance, and project integration. However, searching for specific clauses or procedures was tedious and time-consuming, especially during tight deadlines for compliance filings or study validations.\nTask: My goal was to simplify access to these complex resources by creating an intelligent assistant that could instantly retrieve relevant guidance and procedures from across ERCOT documentation. The intent was to make the process more efficient for engineers and compliance analysts who needed quick, accurate information for studies and model validations.\nAction: I developed a series of AI-powered assistants trained on ERCOT\u2019s official documentation, including Nodal Protocols, Planning Guides, and Resource Integration Manuals. Using a custom embedding and retrieval pipeline built with OpenAI\u2019s text-embedding-3 models, I chunked and embedded each document and implemented semantic search using cosine similarity to return the most relevant sections. I optimized the bots to handle token-bounded queries, ensuring precise retrieval even for long-form technical content. These assistants were deployed through a Streamlit interface, allowing instant search, summarization, and compliance reference capabilities for internal users.\nResult: The ERCOT AI assistants drastically reduced the time required to locate relevant standards and procedures\u2014from hours to seconds. They improved accuracy in model validation, compliance reporting, and interconnection study workflows by providing direct, contextual access to ERCOT documentation. The tools were well received by colleagues and served as proof of concept for integrating AI-powered retrieval systems into utility operations, reinforcing a culture of innovation and continuous improvement.",

Engineers typically write or debug lengthy Python scripts from scratch, which can slow down study workflows and lead to inconsistencies. I saw an opportunity to create an intelligent automation assistant to simplify this process and make PSS\u00aeE scripting accessible to everyone, regardless of their programming background.\nTask: My goal was to design a Copilot-style AI assistant that could automatically generate and explain Python scripts for PSS\u00aeE tasks based on natural language queries. The system needed to retrieve the correct APIs, functions, and syntax from the PSS\u00aeE documentation and integrate them into ready-to-run code for engineers performing planning and dynamic studies.\nAction: I developed the PSS\u00aeE Automation Assistant Bot, which uses a custom semantic retrieval and generation pipeline trained on the full PSS\u00aeE API documentation. The assistant converts user queries into context-aware scripts for contingency analysis, model setup, and validation. Building on this, I created a Multi-Agent Automation Bot that autonomously plans, retrieves, and executes PSS\u00aeE automation tasks using coordinated agents\u2014Planner, Retriever, and Executor\u2014operating in a closed-loop reasoning cycle. Both systems were powered by OpenAI\u2019s embedding and chat models, enabling precise technical retrieval and adaptive script generation through a Streamlit interface.\nResult: The automation assistants significantly reduced the time required to develop and validate PSS\u00aeE automation scripts\u2014from hours to minutes\u2014while maintaining accuracy and consistency across studies. The multi-agent version demonstrated the potential for autonomous workflow execution, freeing engineers from repetitive coding tasks and allowing them to focus on higher-level analysis.

I wanted to create a fast, user-friendly solution to automatically classify fault types using real measurement data.\nTask: My goal was to design and implement a web-based machine learning application that could accurately classify power system faults using phasor measurements such as currents (Ia, Ib, Ic) and voltages (Va, Vb, Vc). The tool needed to compare multiple ML models, visualize their performance, and allow easy testing with new data.\nAction: I developed the Power Fault Classifier App using Streamlit and Python.

I decided to take ownership of both the steady-state and dynamic reviews to ensure everything was accurate before the auditors arrived.\nAction: I reviewed both steady-state and dynamic models, cross-verifying results against operational data and the rating calculator outputs. Using my operations background, I compared transformer and line ratings across different systems and noticed inconsistencies between models and the official calculator data. I traced the issue through SharePoint archives, identified the original submission, and found that incorrect rating data had been entered.

Together, we launched experimental projects in three key areas: predictive maintenance using SCADA telemetry data, AI-based load forecasting models using historical demand data, and natural-language retrieval tools for ERCOT documentation. To accelerate this, I personally built a series of AI assistants\u2014custom RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) bots trained on ERCOT Nodal Protocols, Planning Guides, and the Resource Integration Handbook\u2014that allowed engineers to query standards, model validation procedures, and interconnection processes instantly instead of searching lengthy PDFs. I also developed AELAB and load forecasting apps to automate contingency and demand analysis workflows. To strengthen my technical base, I enrolled in the M.S. in Artificial Intelligence program at UT Austin and later encouraged a Corporate Strategy Analyst to join the program, expanding our internal AI capability.\nResult: These efforts kick-started a digital transformation mindset across departments, leading to multiple active AI pilot projects and growing leadership interest in broader automation initiatives. The RAG assistants became daily reference tools for planning engineers, reducing document lookup time dramatically, while the forecasting and analysis tools improved operational readiness. My work proved that innovation can coexist with compliance in critical infrastructure. It positioned our organization\u2014and my career\u2014for a future where power systems and AI evolve together, aligning perfectly with the culture of companies like Amazon and NextEra that value forward-thinking, scalable innovation.",

Did you take that opportunity? Why or why not? What was the outcome?\nSituation: During my M.S. in Artificial Intelligence program at UT Austin, I took an Optimization course where we worked on complex real-world problems like electric power capacity expansion and workforce scheduling. Both problems involved balancing multiple competing constraints\u2014demand forecasts, cost efficiency, and regulatory limits\u2014while ensuring reliability and long-term scalability.\nTask: My goal was to develop optimization models that not only solved the given problem but also revealed broader opportunities for improving cost efficiency and adaptability. I wanted to push beyond the assignment requirements to create scalable frameworks applicable to real-world energy systems and operations planning.\nAction: I applied linear programming, mixed-integer optimization, and constraint modeling to simulate realistic decision-making environments. In the power capacity expansion project, I incorporated future demand forecasts, cost per megawatt, policy constraints, and reliability margins to determine the optimal mix of nuclear and coal generation. In the scheduling problem, I used similar principles to minimize labor costs for nurse shift assignments while maintaining coverage and fairness constraints. Throughout both projects, I 'looked around corners' by anticipating external factors like policy shifts, equipment retirement, and renewable integration, ensuring my models were flexible and forward-compatible.\nResult: The models I built delivered scalable, cost-efficient solutions\u2014reducing expansion costs in the energy project by optimizing the mix of generation resources and cutting staffing costs by 20% in the scheduling project. These outcomes demonstrated how strategic optimization can extend beyond immediate goals to drive long-term efficiency and resilience. The experience reinforced my passion for using AI and optimization to anticipate challenges and design intelligent, future-ready solutions in power systems.",

These projects had tight deadlines, and any delays in submission could directly impact energization timelines and cause costly operational delays.\nTask: My responsibility was to manage and organize critical project information\u2014such as costs, substation buses, lines, and equipment configurations\u2014from various sources. I needed to submit this data accurately and on time to ERCOT, ensuring compliance with strict deadlines and preventing any energization or operational delays.\nAction: To manage these complex tasks and avoid missing deadlines, I developed a structured, step-by-step process: gathered data from multiple internal and external sources, mapped and organized project data, analyzed and modeled system changes in PSS/E and MAGE, created one-line diagrams to visualize configurations, and tracked project milestones like energization dates and ERCOT deadlines. This structured workflow ensured nothing was missed even under heavy workload.\nResult: By breaking down the process and managing each step systematically, I ensured 100% on-time submissions to ERCOT, preventing energization delays.

The high pressure had lowered morale and was beginning to affect both productivity and communication.\nTask: As the project lead, I needed to re-engage the team, restore motivation, and ensure we delivered the forecast update on time and with high accuracy.\nAction: I began by holding an open team meeting where I acknowledged the challenges and encouraged everyone to share their concerns honestly. Then, I divided the workload into smaller, manageable tasks and reassigned responsibilities based on each member\u2019s strengths and interests. To promote collaboration, I introduced short daily check-ins for progress sharing and peer support. I also made a point to celebrate incremental wins\u2014like meeting a modeling milestone or completing a critical validation\u2014to build momentum and morale.\nResult: The team\u2019s motivation and collaboration improved significantly. We completed the load forecast update ahead of schedule and with excellent accuracy. The renewed sense of teamwork carried into future projects, creating a stronger, more cohesive and results-driven culture within the group.",

A strategic plan was needed to proactively address future reliability risks without exceeding budgetary limits.\nTask: I was responsible for analyzing the data to identify potential system constraints and developing a forward-looking strategy that balanced reliability, cost, and project feasibility.\nAction: I analyzed historical and projected load data, identifying areas at risk of future congestion. Using Python, I built a visualization and analytics tool to present trends, load hotspots, and contingency outcomes in a way that was clear to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I developed a ranked list of proposed projects\u2014combining new transmission lines, substation upgrades, and capacity enhancements\u2014based on cost-benefit analysis and reliability impact. I presented these findings to planning leadership for prioritization.\nResult: The data-driven strategy was approved, leading to several high-priority transmission projects being accelerated for construction. The proactive approach ensured reliable grid performance under growing demand while optimizing investment efficiency. The tool I developed became a recurring asset for future long-term planning and resource allocation discussions.",

    "text": "Principle: Deliver Results / Ownership / Bias for Action / Invent and Simplify\nQuestion: Tell me about a time when you had to manage a backlog of tasks. How did you prioritize and deliver results?\nSituation: At LCRA, as part of the ongoing effort to expand transmission capacity through substation and line upgrades, the Planning group was responsible for publishing three types of equipment ratings for each capital project: Planned, For Construction, and Operational. When I assumed responsibility for this process, there was a significant backlog due to the departure of the previous engineer handling these reviews.\nTask: My task was to review and approve all outstanding ratings across these categories to ensure timely project execution and system reliability. Any delay in updating or approving Operational Ratings could jeopardize system safety and delay energization of key infrastructure.\nAction: To manage and clear the backlog effectively, I implemented a structured prioritization strategy. First, I focused on Operational Ratings since they posed the greatest risk to ongoing operations. Next, I moved to For Construction Ratings, which were essential for projects nearing energization and needed to be finalized months in advance. For Planned Ratings, which often lacked complete data, I proactively engaged with project teams to collect missing information early so reviews could proceed smoothly once higher-priority items were completed. Additionally, I streamlined the review workflow by creating a tracking system that organized projects by priority, ensuring nothing fell through the cracks.\nResult: I successfully cleared the entire backlog, approving all Operational and For Construction Ratings on time and preventing any project delays or reliability risks. My structured approach not only restored compliance but also improved communication across departments. My former Operations supervisor personally thanked me, noting it was the fastest turnaround he had seen in rating approvals, and the Director of Protection commended the accuracy and clarity of my reviews. The streamlined process I implemented remains a standard approach for future engineers.",
