al change in instantaneous active power should occur within one cycle. 

	If the current limit in the inverter is reached when the angle jump is applied, the performance criteria described above may not apply. However, the active power must return to the pre-disturbance level in a stable manner. 



 

3.1.5.15 AGS-ESR Loss of Synchronous Machine Test
The purpose of this test is to confirm the ability of an AGS-ESR to form voltage and work in parallel with a nearby AGS-ESR. It is not intended to examine the black start capability of AGS-ESR nor to require ESRs operate continuously on a grid without synchronous resources. 
This test utilizes a duplicate of the AGS-ESR under test to represent the neighboring plant. The synchronous source can be represented by a voltage source or any source with sufficiently high inertia and low impedance compared to the AGS-ESR under study.
Using the testbench shown in the figure below, with a constant impedance load (L) and a power factor of 0.95 lag, a
