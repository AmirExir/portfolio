•	Develop GIC system models every 5 years in compliance with NERC TPL-007.

•	Maintain GIC data in alignment with SSWG cases.

•	Communicate information related to updates to the GIC system models during model builds via the GIC listserv.

•	Review and update the GIC Procedure Manual (at least every five years).

1.2	Introduction to Case Building Procedures and Methodologies
The principal function of the SSWG is to provide steady-state power flow models, or base cases, which contain appropriate equipment characteristics, system data, and shall represent projected system conditions.  This procedure manual is intended to demonstrate compliance with NERC Reliability Standards applicable to steady-state modeling. The ERCOT Protocols require the SSWG Cases developed for annual planning purposes to contain, as much as practicable, information consistent with the Network Operations Model.
