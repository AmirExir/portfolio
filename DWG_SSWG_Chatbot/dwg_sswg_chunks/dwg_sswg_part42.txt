p transformer when the unit is operating at its maximum net dependable MW capability. Qmax is calculated from the lagging Resource Registration data MW4 MVar value by subtracting Resource Registration data auxiliary load MVAr. 
	
	Example:
	
	Resource Registration data lagging MW4 value is 85 MVAr
	Resource Registration data auxiliary Load is 5 MVAr  
	In this example, Qmax is 85 – 5 = 80 MVAr 
	
	Qmin
	
	Qmin is the maximum net leading MVAr observed at the low side of the generator step up transformer when the unit is operating at its maximum net dependable MW capability. Qmin is calculated from the leading Resource Registration data MW4 MVar value by subtracting Resource Registration data auxiliary load MVAr. 
	
	Example:
	
	Resource Registration data leading MW4 value is -55 MVAr
	Resource Registration data auxiliary Load is 5 MVAr
	In this example, Qmin is -55 – 5 = -60 MVAr
