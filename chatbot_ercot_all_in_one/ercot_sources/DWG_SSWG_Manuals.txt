1	INTRODUCTION
1.1	ERCOT Steady-State Working Group Scope
The ERCOT Steady-State Working Group (SSWG) operates under the direction of the Reliability and Operations Subcommittee. The SSWG is a non-voting working group whose members include representatives from ERCOT Transmission Service Providers (TSPs) and ERCOT staff. The main objective of SSWG is to produce steady state seasonal and future steady-state base cases, and GIC system models. The SSWG meets twice a year to accomplish these tasks, and at other times during the year as needed to resolve any impending power-flow modeling issues or to provide technical support to the ROS. The SSWG responsibilities are further described as follows:
•	Develop a set of SSWG Cases annually.

•	Update the SSWG Cases on a biannual basis.

•	Maintain and update the Transmission Project Information Tracking (TPIT) report, which reflects data used for SSWG Case development and updates. Update the TPIT report on a triannual basis.

•	Maintain and update the Planning Data Dictionary to reflect current and future year bus and county information. 

•	Review and update, as necessary (at least every five years), the SSWG Procedural Manual to reflect current planning practices and the latest steady-state modeling methodologies.

•	Prepare data for and review seasonal transmission loss factor calculations by January 1st of each year.  

•	Develop steady state and geomagnetic disturbance model processes for compliance with NERC Reliability Standards for Transmission Planner and Planning Authority/Coordinator.

•	Coordinate tie-line modeling data with adjacent Transmission Planners via the case-building process. 

•	Review and update the contingency definition files used for planning. 

•	Address issues as directed by the ROS.

•	Annually review status of the Network Model Management System (NMMS) and Topology Processor software regarding new planning data needs.

•	Develop GIC system models every 5 years in compliance with NERC TPL-007.

•	Maintain GIC data in alignment with SSWG cases.

•	Communicate information related to updates to the GIC system models during model builds via the GIC listserv.

•	Review and update the GIC Procedure Manual (at least every five years).

1.2	Introduction to Case Building Procedures and Methodologies
The principal function of the SSWG is to provide steady-state power flow models, or base cases, which contain appropriate equipment characteristics, system data, and shall represent projected system conditions.  This procedure manual is intended to demonstrate compliance with NERC Reliability Standards applicable to steady-state modeling. The ERCOT Protocols require the SSWG Cases developed for annual planning purposes to contain, as much as practicable, information consistent with the Network Operations Model.  
Planning models are bus-branch representations of the transmission system (60 kV and above), which includes buses, branches, impedances, facility ratings, loads, reactive devices, transformers, generators, and DC lines. 
The ROS directs the SSWG as to which cases are to be created via changes to this procedure manual.  Currently, the SSWG builds a set of steady-state base cases on an annual basis, collectively called the SSWG Cases.  The SSWG Cases consist of the following:
•	8 seasonal cases representing on-peak and off-peak conditions for the four seasons of the next year beyond the year the cases are built  
•	6 future year cases representing summer on-peak conditions with the first year beginning two years beyond the year the cases are built.  
•	1 future year case representing high renewable generation ouput and minimum load conditions
•	1 future year case representing minimum load conditions 
The future summer peak cases are collectively known as the Annual Planning Models and are subject to the requirements defined in the ERCOT Protocols.  Each set of SSWG Cases are to be built or updated during the biannual update cycle.
Various groups utilize the SSWG Cases for a variety of tasks.   These tasks include, but are not limited to the following:

•	ERCOT and TSPs test the interconnected systems modeled in the cases against the transmission system planning performance requirements set forth by NERC,  ERCOT Planning Guide and their individual TSP planning criteria to assess future system reliability. 

•	ROS Working Groups and ERCOT use the SSWG Cases as the basis for other types of calculations and studies including, but not limited to: 

o	Internal planning studies and generation interconnection studies
o	Voltage control and reactive planning studies
o	Basis for Dynamics Working Group stability studies
o	ERCOT transmission loss factor calculation
o	Basis for ERCOT operating cases and FERC 715 filing

3	SSWG CASE PROCEDURES AND SCHEDULES
3.1	General
The SSWG and ERCOT create the SSWG Cases annually and update them biannually at fixed intervals throughout each year.  This section describes the creation and update process and schedule to create and update SSWG Cases .
3.2	SSWG Case Definitions and Build Schedules
The SSWG Cases are created by SSWG each year and consist of the following:

•	Eight seasonal cases starting with the SPG cases representing on-peak and off-peak conditions for the four seasons of the next year beyond the year the cases are built.  
•	Six future year cases representing summer on-peak conditions with the first year beginning two years beyond the year the cases are built.  
•	One future year case representing high renewable and minimum load conditions. 
•	One future year case representing minimum load conditions. 
SSWG Case seasons are defined as follows:

SPG		March, April, May
SUM		June, July, August, September
FAL		October, November
WIN		December, January, February

The following table is a guide for case creation.  YR represents the year the case is created.

Notes:
1.	Cases to represent the maximum expected load during the season.
2.	Cases to represent maximum expected load during month of transmission in-service date.
3.	Cases to represent lowest load on same day as the corresponding seasonal case (not a minimum case). For example, (YR) FAL2 case represents the lowest load on the same day as the (YR) FAL1 case.
4.	Case to represent the absolute minimum load expected for the year.
5.	Case to represent a high renewable generation dispatch and absolute minimum load expected for the year.
3.2.1	Updates
The SSWG Case updates will be made in the MOD environment by changing an existing PMCR or creating a new PMCR.  It should be recognized that impedance or ratings updates made to the Network Operations Model after the TP case was created will have to be submitted as a ‘NOMCR Pending’ or ‘NOMCR Submitted’ PMCR to maintain consistency with the Network Operations Model.  See Planning Guide Section 6.4 for additional information about the TPIT process.


 
 
3.3	SSWG Case Build Processes
3.3.1	Overview
The SSWG Cases are based upon the ERCOT Network Operations Model.  Network model data from the ERCOT NMMS system is used to create the TP case.  The TP case, or an incremental update to the previously uploaded TP case, is then imported into MOD and becomes the MOD base case.  ERCOT and the TSPs submit Standard PMCRs and PMCRs into MOD.  Other PMCRs are also submitted into MOD (i.e. ‘NOMCR_PENDING’ and ‘NOMCR_SUBMITTED’ PMCRs) which are aimed at maintaining consistency between NMMS and MOD.  Additionally, ERCOT and the TSPs submit Load, Generation, and Device Control Profiles into MOD.  After being submitted, approved, and accepted, the combination of PMCRs and Profiles are applied to the MOD seed case to create the SSWG Cases.
The primary software tools utilized for these processes are MOD, MOD File Builder and PSS®E. MOD is a web based application maintained by ERCOT.  TSPs and ERCOT use MOD to submit projects and profiles for SSWG Cases.  ERCOT compiles these submitted projects and profiles to build the SSWG Cases.  Case modifications can be accomplished in MOD by either uploading PMCRs in MOD, or by manual entry using the MOD interface.  SSWG members should consult the Planning Model Design Guidelines & Expectations manual for specific instructions on MOD.
3.3.2	Incremental Update
Upon commencement of each new SSWG Case creation and each update, the SSWG implements an incremental update to the MOD base case in order to include the latest Network Operations Model data into the SSWG Cases.  This is accomplished by using MOD File Builder to compare the RAW files of topology processed NMMS data with selected data currently existing in MOD.  MOD File Builder is used to create a comparison PMCR that updates the corresponding Planning Model data in MOD to be consistent with the Network Operations Model data.  The comparison PMCR is subsequently submitted into MOD and committed to the MOD base case to perform the incremental MOD base case update.  
The sample flowchart below identifies the general process:

 
 
3.3.3	Transmission In-Service Date for the TP Case
The TP case will be generated by ERCOT staff using an NMMS Transmission In-Service Date agreed upon by SSWG. The TP case will contain all existing NOMCRs with a Transmission In-Service Date on or before the agreed upon Transmission In-Service Date. Any NOMCR submitted after the TP case download which happens to have a Transmission In-Service Date prior to the agreed upon Transmission In-Service Date will not be included in the TP case.  For that situation, the TSP who owns the NOMCR must submit a PMCR to appropriately include the network model change in the SSWG Cases.
3.3.4	Entity Responsibilities
The  SSWG Cases are assembled and produced as a collaborative effort by the SSWG.  The responsibilities for providing this data are divided among the various Market Participants (MPs) and ERCOT. These data provision responsibilities may overlap among the various MPs because MPs may designate their representative or MPs may be a member of more than one MP group.  MPs can generally be divided into four groups: TSPs, LSEs, REs, and Market Entities.  ERCOT staff is included as a fifth entity with data provision responsibilities.  The data responsibilities of each group are as follows:
3.3.4.1	TSPs
•	It is the responsibility of each TSP to provide accurate modeling information for all ERCOT Transmission Facilities owned or planned by the TSP.  Submission requirements and naming conventions described in the ERCOT Planning Model Design & Expectations manual shall be followed.
•	Future Transmission Facility changes will be submitted as PMCRs. A PMCR phase date should correspond to the transmission in-service date. PMCRs should be submitted as far out into the future as possible. This technique will make the case building process more efficient when transitioning to new case builds.
•	TSPs shall submit Profiles of all load data and associated topology for the load entities of which they are designated representatives, as well as, any other load for which it has accepted responsibility for modeling.  
•	TSPs shall change the load ID to ‘ER’ (or ‘E1’, ‘E2’, etc.) for loads for which it has historically  submitted data but no longer accepts responsibility.  ERCOT will determine the owner of the load and ensure they are part of the ALDR and SSWG processes. See Appendix E for additional details.
•	PUN loads and POI busses will be provided by TSPs.
•	NOIEs have the option of submitting a generation dispatch or deferring to ERCOT staff.
•	Proper transmission system voltages will be maintained by submitting accurate data for static and dynamic reactive resources and transformer settings via a Device Control Profile for each case.  Scheduled bus voltages are maintained by the TSPs and submitted via Device Control Profiles as well.  TSPs can suggest different generator reactive limits Qmax and Qmin for ERCOT to submit in the Load Generation Profiles and should submit data to collaborate the need for the change such as historical unit operation and biennial reactive tests.  ERCOT will submit the change and follow-up with the RE and TSP to determine any Resource Registration Data modifications.
•	If the TSPs identify errors with generator data or RE topology, the TSPs will notify ERCOT staff in accordance with the identified NMMS process.  This process entails email notification to the TSP of a Resource Registration Data change in their footprint and posting of updated Resource Registration Data data on the Citrix NMMS_POSTINGS area of the ERCOT Market Information System.
•	Review and resolve all inconsistencies identified from the incremental update process for their respective Transmission Facilities.
•	The “MOD Project” is submitted by the TSPs and the MOD Project ID for the project will become the “TPIT number”.  When editing an accepted project, click the “Edit” button from the project list to put project into “Preliminary” state, then “View” the project from project list and use the “Replace” button to upload edited project.  This will preserve the MOD Project ID for TPIT.
•	TSPs are responsible for updating TPIT project and phase information in MOD during each tri-annual case build/update for all the applicable fields as shown below.

4	MODELING METHODOLOGIES
4.1	Bus, Area, Zone and Owner Data
4.1.1	Bus Data Records
All existing and planned transmission (60kV and above) and generator (greater than 10 MW) terminal buses shall be modeled in the SSWG Cases. Each bus record has a bus number, name, base kV, bus type code, area number, zone number, per-unit bus nominal voltage magnitude, bus voltage phase angle, and owner number. Reactive resources shall be modeled in either the fixed shunt table or the switched shunt table and shall not be modeled in any bus record.  
4.1.2	Bus Number Ranges
The ERCOT transmission system is modeled within the full PSS®E bus number range (1 through 999,997). The Chairman of the SSWG allocates bus ranges, new or amended, with confirmation from the SSWG members.  Each TSP represents their network in the SSWG Cases within the TSP’s designated bus number range. ERCOT represents Resource Entities (REs) and Private Use Networks (PUNs) in the SSWG Cases within ERCOT’s designated bus number range.  Bus number range assignments are listed in the Bus/Zone Range Table in Appendix A.
4.1.3	Bus Names 
Bus names shall not identify the customers or owners of loads or generation at new buses unless requested by customers.  The twelve character bus name in the planning model shall follow certain technical criteria as stated in the ERCOT Nodal Protocol Section 3.10 and Other Binding Documents.
4.1.4	Area Numbers 
TSPs and ERCOT are assigned area names and numbers for modeling purposes.  Area names and number assignments are listed in the Bus/Zone Range Table in Appendix A.  The area number does not refer to a geographic area.
4.1.5	Zone Number Ranges
In PSS®E, each zone data record has a zone number and a zone name identifier. The Chairman of the SSWG allocates zone number ranges, new or amended, with confirmation from SSWG members. Each TSP represents their network in the SSWG Cases using allocated zone number ranges. Zone numbers from within the TSP’s designated zone range are assigned by the TSP.  ERCOT represents Resource Entities (REs) and Private Use Networks (PUNs) in the SSWG Cases using zone ranges allocated to ERCOT.  Zone numbers from within ERCOT’s designated zone range are assigned by ERCOT.  Zone number range assignments are listed in the Bus/Zone Range Table in Appendix A.  


4.1.6	Owner IDs
In PSS®E, each owner data record has an owner number and an owner name identifier.  Owner IDs are assigned by ERCOT.  
4.1.7	Bus Voltage Limits
Normal and Emergency Bus Voltage Minimum and Maximum Limits shall reflect voltage limits set forth by the “System Operating Limit Methodology for Planning and Operations Horizon” document, however, Emergency Bus Voltage Limits for generator buses shall reflect minimum generator or high-side of GSU steady-state or ride-through voltage limitations.
4.1.8	Bus Data Source
Data Element	Source For Existing  Elements	Source For Planned Elements
Bus Number	NMMS	MOD PMCR
Bus Name	NMMS 	MOD PMCR 
Area Number/Name	NMMS	MOD PMCR
Owner Number/Name	NMMS	MOD PMCR
Bus Code	NMMS & MOD STD PMCR	MOD PMCR
Bus Voltage & angle	NMMS & MOD PMCR	MOD PMCR
Bus Voltage Limits	NMMS & MOD PMCR	MOD PMCR
4.2	Load Data
Real and reactive load forecasts within the SSWG Cases are populated with data consistent with, but not necessarily identical to, load data submitted through the ALDR process.  In general, the ALDR contains non-coincident load data while the SSWG Cases contain load data coincident with either the individual TSP projected load levels or the ERCOT system projected load level.  Furthermore, some of the loads defined in the SSWG Cases are not contained within the ALDR (e.g. off-peak, Spring, and Fall loads are not defined in the ALDR).  See Planning Guides Section 6.5 for further information about the ALDR process.
Each load data record contains a bus number, load identifier, load status, area, zone, real and reactive power components of constant MVA load, real and reactive power components of constant current load, and real and reactive power components of constant admittance load.  In general, loads (MW and MVAR) should be modeled on the high side of transformers serving load at less than 60 kV.  However, special conditions may require more modeling detail such as parallel operation of power transformers from different sources.
Load Resources are not modeled in the SSWG Cases but are considered a Responsive Reserve.
4.2.1	Guidelines 
(1)	The bus number in the load data record must be a bus that exists in the SSWG Case.  The load identifier is a two-character alphanumeric identifier used to differentiate between loads at a bus. All self-serve loads must be identified by “SS”. If there are multiple self-serve loads at the same bus, then the self-serve loads will be identified by S1, S2, S3, etc.  See Section 4.3.1.1.  Partial self-serve load should be modeled as a multiple load with “SS” identifying the self-serve portion. See Appendix E for additional details.
(2)	The load data record zone number must be in the zone range of the TSP submitting the load, or in the zone range of ERCOT for loads associated with PUNs.  Zone numbers for loads do not have to be the same as the bus to which the load is connected.
(3)	Generator auxiliary load should not be modeled at generating station buses. Refer to section 4.3.1. 
(4)	In conformance with NERC Reliability Standards and the Planning Guide Section 6.5, entities not having representation on SSWG shall submit their load data to ERCOT or, if the directly connected TDSP has agreed to be the agent on SSWG for that entity, to that TSP.  If load data is not timely submitted on the schedule and in the format defined by the TSP, then ERCOT shall calculate loads based on historical data and insert these loads into the SSWG Cases during annual updates.
(5)	Multiple loads from different TSPs at a bus may be used. At this time, each TSP can define a load with a load ID of its choice. Careful coordination, however, is required between TSP representatives to ensure that the multiple loads modeled at the same bus are modeled correctly with unique load IDs. See Appendix E for additional details.
(6)	Guidelines for modeling DER  are detailed in the following table. DER shall not be modeled as negative load in any case.
DER Type	Should be Embedded in Load Forecasts?	Modeled as Generation by ERCOT?
DGR	No	Yes
DESR	No	Yes
SODG	No	Yes
UDG1 	Yes	No
1Specific guidelines for modeling UDG involve representing the aggregated total nameplate value for UDG behind each load point in each load distributed generation field, with the ‘Distributed Generation Operator Mode’ field disabled. This is to ensure that only the aggregated total nameplate capability for the UDG is reflected in the models. Enabling the ‘Distributed Generation Operator Mode’ field could risk disproportionate representation of the UDG contribution due to the load models currently aggregating UDG contributions.
4.2.2	Load Data Source	
NMMS determines the bus where the load is connected.  TSPs and ERCOT will assign MW and MVAR values by submitting Load/Generation Profiles through MOD.  New loads or corrections to the location of existing loads will be submitted by PMCR through MOD.
Data Element	Source For Existing  Elements	Source For Planned Elements
Bus Number	NMMS	MOD PMCR
Bus Name	NMMS 	MOD PMCR 
Area Number/Name	NMMS	MOD PMCR

1 - For the existing load elements, the scalable flag in SSWG Cases is populated based on the value of “CustomerLoad” attribute “Conforming Load Flag” in NMMS. If the “Conforming Load Flag” attribute is set to TRUE in NMMS, then the Scalable flag is “Checked” in SSWG Cases.
2 - For the existing load elements, the Interruptible flag in SSWG Cases is populated based on the value of “CustomerLoad” attribute “Interruptible” in NMMS. If the “Interruptible” attribute is set to TRUE  in NMMS, then the Interruptible flag is “Checked” in SSWG Cases.
4.3	Generator Data
4.3.1	Acquisition of Generator Data
4.3.1.1	Generation that meets Planning Guide 6.9(1)
ERCOT will utilize the latest data provided by the IEs/REs in the Security Screening Study, or Full Interconnection Study if started, to model the Resource using the simple model.

Unit Reactive Limits should be modeled at a 95% power factor of the PMAX.  Generator ID prefixes will be designated as specified in Appendix D.  

Each simple modeled generator will be modeled in the following Zone:

Zone Number	Zone Name
1189	SIMPLE_Model




4.3.1.2	Generation that meets Planning Guide 6.9(2)
Upon meeting Planning Guide 6.9(2), ERCOT will utilize Resource Registration data provided by IEs/REs in accordance with ERCOT Protocols, Market Guides and the Generation Interconnection Process to model the Resource.  Only net real and reactive generator outputs and ratings should be modeled in SSWG Cases. Net generation is equal to the gross generation minus station auxiliaries and other internal power requirements.  All non-self-serve generation connected at 60 kV and above with at least 10 MW aggregated at the point of interconnect must be explicitly modeled. A generator explicitly modeled must include generator step-up transformer and actual no-load tap position. Generation of less than 10 MW is still required to be modeled, but not explicitly.
Unit Reactive Limits (leading and lagging) for existing units are obtained from the Resource Registration data.  The Resource Registration data should reflect the most recent generator reactive unit test data conducted by the RE.  Limited Resource Registration data shall be made available to SSWG upon request. 
Generator reactive limits should be modeled with one value for Qmax and one value for Qmin as described below:
	Qmax
	
	Qmax is the maximum net lagging MVAr observed at the low side of the generator step up transformer when the unit is operating at its maximum net dependable MW capability. Qmax is calculated from the lagging Resource Registration data MW4 MVar value by subtracting Resource Registration data auxiliary load MVAr. 
	
	Example:
	
	Resource Registration data lagging MW4 value is 85 MVAr
	Resource Registration data auxiliary Load is 5 MVAr  
	In this example, Qmax is 85 – 5 = 80 MVAr 
	
	Qmin
	
	Qmin is the maximum net leading MVAr observed at the low side of the generator step up transformer when the unit is operating at its maximum net dependable MW capability. Qmin is calculated from the leading Resource Registration data MW4 MVar value by subtracting Resource Registration data auxiliary load MVAr. 
	
	Example:
	
	Resource Registration data leading MW4 value is -55 MVAr
	Resource Registration data auxiliary Load is 5 MVAr
	In this example, Qmin is -55 – 5 = -60 MVAr
4.3.1.3	Self-Serve Generation
Self-serve generators serve local load that does not flow through the ERCOT transmission system. Generation dispatch may be submitted by TSPs on a biannual basis for self-serve facilities serving self-serve load modeled in the SSWG Case. If no generation dispatch is submitted by the TSPs, ERCOT will dispatch the units accordingly to meet the self-serve load.  Total self-serve generation MWs shall match total self-serve load MWs. 
4.3.1.4	Distribution Generation Resources, Distribution Energy Storage Resources, and Settlement Only Distribution Generators 
ERCOT will utilize Resource Registration data provided by IEs/REs to model DGR, DESR, and SODG. SODG will be aggregated by fuel type and represented as a simple model and will be assumed to operate at unity power factor with no voltage control.
4.3.1.5	Coordination with other ERCOT Working Groups 
All generator data should be coordinated with the Dynamics Working Group, Operations Working Group, Network Data Support Working Group and System Protection Working Group members to assure that it is correct before submitting the cases. This will insure that all of the cases have the most current steady state and dynamics information.  The following items should be provided to these working groups for data coordination:
•	Unit bus number
•	Unit ID
•	Unit maximum and minimum real power capabilities
•	Unit maximum and minimum reactive power capabilities
•	Unit MVA base
•	Resistive and reactive machine impedances
•	Resistive and reactive generator step-up transformer impedances
•	Reactive devices modeled on the Generator side
4.3.2	Load and Generation Balance
Before the generation schedule can be determined, the expected ERCOT load and losses (demand) must be determined. Each MW of demand needs to be accounted for by a MW of generation. 
4.3.3	Generation Dispatch Methodology for Planning Purposes
In order to simulate the future market, the following methodology for generation dispatch has been adopted for building the  Steady State Cases, with the exception of the HRML case. The HRML case build process is described separately below. Generation dispatch, as described below, is for planning and may not necessarily reflect the actual real-time dispatch.
Existing and planned units owned by Non-Opt-In Entities (NOIE) are dispatched according to the NOIE dispatch spreadsheets submitted to ERCOT on a biannual basis; unless a NOIE requests that their units are to be dispatched according to the order that is described below or do not submit a NOIE dispatch. 
Private network generation is also dispatched independently. The units are dispatched to meet their load modeled in the case. The import/export contributions of the DC Ties will be set based on historical data to the extent that the contributions are consistent with those indicated in the most recent Capacity, Demand and Reserves (CDR) Report.  Likewise, wind units are dispatched in accordance with Appendix B, Method for Calculating Wind Generation Levels in SSWG Cases, to extent that the dispatch is consistent with the regional contributions indicated in the CDR Report. Solar units are dispatched at a level consistent with the CDR Report. Battery Energy Storage units are dispatched at a level consistent with the CDR Report for On-Peak Cases.
Units that are solely for black start purposes are to be modeled in the SSWG Cases; however, these units should not be dispatched.  Black Start units are designated with a unit ID of “BS”.
All other transmission level units are dispatched using an economic-simulation software package. Units will be dispatched to minimize production costs taking into account unit start-up times and cost and heat rates while adhering to the following guidelines for each set of cases: (YR is the year the case is created)

SSWG members shall be able to review and suggest changes to the generation dispatch based on historical information.
In all cases spinning reserve is maintained according to ERCOT Nodal Operating Guides, Section 2.3.1.1, to the extent that the extraordinary dispatch conditions in Section 4.3.3.1 Item 1 of this guide are not deployed.  Specifically, spinning reserve is maintained such that 50% of the Responsive Reserve Service obligation is made up of generation resources with the other 50% of Responsive Reserve Service obligation coming from Load Resources.  The dispatch may be modified in the seasonal SSWG Cases if necessary to maintain voltages at acceptable levels.
New transmission level Generation Resources will be included in the SSWG Cases on a biannual basis according to the procedures defined in Planning Guide, Section 6.9, addition of Proposed Generation Resources to the Planning Models.
New DGRs, DESRs, and SODGs will be included in the SSWG Cases on a biannual basis during the incremental updates with operational data from NMMS.  
4.3.3.1 	Extraordinary Dispatch Conditions
On occasion, the total load plus the spinning reserve indicated above can exceed the amount of available generation due to load forecasts.  SSWG Cases typically model load at individual coincident TSP peaks instead of at the ERCOT coincident system peak.  When such a condition is encountered in future cases, ERCOT may increase generation resources by taking the indicated action, or adding generation, in the following order:

1.	Ignore spinning reserve.
2.	Increase NOIE generation with prior NOIE consent.
3.	DC ties dispatched to increase transfers into ERCOT to the full capacity of the DC ties.
4.	Dispatch SODG natural gas and diesel units up to their full capacity.
5.	Dispatch units that have changed their status to indefinite mothball within the last 18 months and that have not announced their return to service. The dispatch methodology for this procedure is detailed below.
6.	Scale transmission level wind generation dispatch up to 50% of capability.
7.	Add units with interconnection agreements, but do not meet all of the requirements for inclusion defined in the Planning Guide. 
8.	Dispatch units that have changed their status to indefinite mothball over 18 months ago and have not announced their return to service. The dispatch methodology for this procedure is detailed below.
9.	Add publicly announced  units without interconnection agreements.
10.	Dispatch units that are solely for black start.
11.	Scale wind generation dispatch up to 100% of capability
12.	Add generation resources to the 345 kV transmission system near the sites of existing or retired units.

ERCOT shall post the extraordinary dispatch details used in each case to the MIS website.  
4.3.4	Generation Guidelines	
(1)	ERCOT will model registered resources and resource equipment.
(2)	ERCOT will model future transmission level resources and resource equipment in the interconnection process using the “Generation_Interconnection” project type in MOD.  The project name shall contain the ERCOT GINR. 
(3)	ERCOT will model SODGs in using the “Standard PMCR” project type in MOD.
(4)	TSPs may model resource and resource equipment not requiring ERCOT registration and not required by the Generation Interconnection process if they desire the resource to be in the SSWG case.
(5)	ERCOT shall update the PMAX and PMIN values based upon the Resource Registration Data net seasonal sustainable ratings.  The generator identifier is a two-character alphanumeric identifier used to differentiate between generators at a bus. All self-serve generators must be identified by P1. If there are multiple self-serve generators at the same bus, then self-serve generators must be identified by P1, P2, P3, etc. Self-serve economic generators must be identified by “PE”.
(6)	Refer to Appendix D for the generator identifiers used in the SSWG cases.
(7)	In extraordinary dispatch scenarios, the following generator zones should be assigned by ERCOT:
 
Extraordinary Dispatch Step
Zone Number	Zone Name
4. & 7. Mothballed units that have not announced their return to service.	1195	EX_MB
6. For units with interconnection agreements, but do not meet all of the requirements for inclusion defined in the Planning Guide	1196	EX_IA_NOFC
8. For publicly announced units without interconnect agreements.	1197	EX_PUB_NOIA
12. For generation resources added to the 345 kV transmission system near the sites of existing or retired units.	1198	EX_FAKEGEN

Methodology for Dispatching Mothballed Units
In order to minimize the effect on transmission plans of the decision to use mothballed units to meet the load requirement, the generation that is needed from mothballed units as a group will be allocated over all the mothballed units on a capacity ratio share basis.  If this technique results in some of the mothballed units being dispatched at a level below their minimum load, an economic ranking will be used to remove the least economic units from consideration for that particular case so that the allocation of the load requirement among the remaining mothballed units will result in all of those units being loaded above their minimum loads.
For example, assume that, in some future year, ERCOT has a projected peak demand of 80,000MW and a total installed resource capacity of 82,000MW, with 3000MW of that installed capacity being units that are mothballed and have not indicated they will return.  For this simple example, assume that the mothballed capacity is 20 generating units of equal 150MW size.  Ignoring losses and spinning reserve requirement, the steady-state case would need to include 1000MW of the 3000MW mothballed capacity in order to match the load.   Thus, each of the 20 mothballed units would be set to an output of 50MW in the steady-state case (assuming their minimum load is less than 50MW).
Consideration of Alternative Dispatch for Studies
While this treatment of mothballed units attempts to generally minimize the effect of the assumption that mothballed units will be used to meet the load requirement in the SSWG Cases (rather than assumed new generation), the planning process should also consider alternative generation dispatches in instances where this treatment of mothballed units could have a direct effect on transmission plans.  Specifically, in instances where having a mothballed unit available would alleviate the need for a transmission project that would be required to meet reliability criteria if the mothballed unit were not to return, the transmission project should not be deferred based on the assumption that the mothballed unit will return to service. 
4.3.4	Voltage Profile Adjustments
	After the generation dispatch has been determined, the expected voltage profile for the system can be applied. The scheduled voltages should reflect actual voltage set points used by the generator operators. 
	TSPs should check the voltages at several key locations within the system when modifying generation control voltages and reactive devices.  Voltage profile changes can be accomplished by turning on/turning off capacitors or reactors, and by changing the operations of generators (turning on/turning off/redispatching for VAR control). The cases should ultimately model system voltages that could be reasonably expected to occur.

4.4	Branch Data
4.4.1	Use of Branch Record Data Fields
All existing and planned transmission lines (60 kV and above) shall be modeled in the SSWG Cases.
4.4.1.1	Bus Specifications 
The end points of each branch in the SSWG Cases are specified by “from” and “to” bus numbers.  In most cases the end point buses are in the same TSP area.  However, when the “from” and “to” buses used to specify a branch are in different TSP areas, the branch is considered to be a tie line (See Section 4.4.3, Coordination of Tie Lines). Branch data includes exactly two buses. The end points of Multi-Section Lines (MSL) are defined by two buses specified in a branch data record (See Section 4.4.2). There are other components that are modeled with more than two buses, such as transformers with tertiary that may be represented by three-bus models. 
4.4.1.2	Branch Circuit Identifier 
Circuit identifiers are limited to two alphanumeric characters.  Each TSP will determine its own naming convention for circuit identifiers.  ERCOT will determine its own naming convention for branches owned by REs and PUNs with careful coordination with connected TSPs.  These identifiers are typically numeric values (e.g. 1 or 2) that indicate the number of branches between two common buses, but many exceptions exist. 
4.4.1.3	Branch Impedance and Admittance Data
The branch resistance, reactance, and admittance data contained in the SSWG Cases are expressed in per-unit quantities that are calculated from a base impedance. The base impedance for transmission lines is calculated from the system base MVA and the base voltage of the transmission branch of interest.  The system base MVA used in the SSWG Cases is 100 MVA (S = 100 MVA).  The base voltage for a transmission line branch is the nominal line-to-line voltage of that particular transmission branch (See Transformer Data for Calculation of Transformer Impedances). Therefore the base impedance used for calculating transmission branch impedances is:

  Ohms
This base impedance is then used to convert the physical quantities of the transmission line into per-unit values to be used in the SSWG Cases.
4.4.1.3.1	Resistance
Once the total transmission line resistance is known and expressed in ohms, then this value is divided by the base impedance to obtain the per-unit resistance to be used in the SSWG Cases.  This calculation is as follows:
  
4.4.1.3.2	Reactance
Once the total transmission line reactance is known and expressed in ohms, then this value is divided by the base impedance to obtain the per-unit reactance to be used in the SSWG Cases.  This calculation is as follows:
  
4.4.1.3.3	Admittance
Branch admittance is expressed as total branch charging susceptance in per unit on the 100 MVA system base.  The total branch charging is expressed in MVARs and divided by the system base MVA to get per unit charging.  The equation used to accomplish this depends on the starting point. Typically the charging of a transmission line is known in KVARs.  Given the total transmission line charging expressed in KVARs, the equation to calculate the total branch charging susceptance in per unit on the system base is as follows:
  

Or, given the total capacitive reactance to neutral expressed in ohms  , the equation to calculate the total branch charging susceptance in per unit on the system base is as follows:

 

 
4.4.1.4	Facility Ratings
SSWG Cases contain fields for five ratings for each branch record, including zero impedance branches.  The ratings associated with these five fields are commonly referred to as Rate 1, Rate 2, Rate 3, Rate 4, and Rate 5.  Each TSP has their own methodology for calculating these ratings and shall be made available to others within ERCOT upon request. Following are the SSWG Case facility ratings corresponding to the ratings defined in Nodal Protocol 2.1:

Planning Case Rating Definitions	Corresponding Nodal Protocol Section 2.1 Definitions
Rate 1	Normal Rating
Rate 2	Emergency Rating
Rate 3	 15-Minute Rating
Rate 4	Transformer 2-Hour/Branch Conductor Rating
Rate 5	Relay Loadability Rating

By definition, Rate 5 ≥ Rate 3 ≥ Rate 2 ≥ Rate 1 and Rate 4 ≥ Rate 2 ≥ Rate 1.

When performing security studies, ERCOT will default to Rate 2, unless the TSP has previously indicated in writing that other ratings (e.g., Rate 1) should be used.  If problems exist using Rate 2 and Rate 2 is significantly different from Rate 4, then ERCOT will contact the TSP. There may also be 8888 or 9999 ratings in the SSWG Cases. The 8888 rating represents items such as change of ownership at a substation facility, a radial Point Of Interconnect to a customer, normally open facilities inside a substation used for load transfer and other similar situations that are not an integral part of the transmission grid itself. The 8888 ratings are used by the facility owner to indicate they have reviewed the rating. The 9999 ratings are a default value assigned to facilities by the NMMS system as part of the base case preparation; they apply to similar situations as the 8888 ratings and are not an integral part of the transmission grid itself. For Rate 5, the default value for an element that is not protected by a relay loadability rating is 88888, and the default value for an element that will be protected by a relay loadability rating which hasn’t been determined yet is 99999.
4.4.1.4.1	Most Limiting Series Element 
Facility ratings shall not exceed the most limiting applicable equipment rating of the individual equipment that comprises the facility. If the continuous or two (2) hour ratings of any series elements at the station terminals is less than the associated transmission line’s continuous or two (2) hour rating, then the most limiting elements’ rating data will be used as the Rate 1 and/or Rate 2 rating for the transmission line.  The scope of equipment addressed shall include, but not be limited to, conductors, transformers, relay protective devices, terminal equipment, and series and shunt compensation devices.
4.4.1.5	Shunt Admittance
Branch Data records include four fields for complex admittance for line shunts.  These records are rarely used in the SSWG Cases.
4.4.1.6	Status
Branch data records include a field for branch status.  Entities are allowed to submit branch data with an out-of-service status for equipment normally out of service.  
4.4.1.7	Line Length and Ownership
4.4.1.7.1	Line Length
This data will be provided in miles.
4.4.1.7.2	Ownership
Owner IDs are assigned by ERCOT.  The PSS®E line data record allows the specification of up to four owners for each branch including percent ownership. The percent ownership of each line should sum up to 100%.  Facilities owned by Generators will be assigned a non-TSP ownership ID in the SSWG Cases.

OSRs are ratings submitted by jointly owned facility Owners for their specific ratings  to ERCOT Network Operational Models.
4.4.1.7.3	Practices for Verification
Transmission line length for existing lines should be verified from field data and actual values entered into the power flow model.  A simple check can be utilized to verify certain modeling parameters for overhead lines.  The following equation is an approximation that applies to transmission lines that are completely overhead or assuming    MVA then


 

 
4.4.2	Multi-Section Line Grouping 
A multi-section line is defined as a grouping of several previously defined branches into one long circuit having several sub-sections or segments. 

Example: Two circuits exist (Figure 1) which originate at the same substation (4001) and terminate at the same substation (4742).  Each circuit has a tap to Substation A and a tap to Substation B.  If a fault occurs or maintenance requires an outage of Circuit 09, the circuit would be out-of-service between bus 4001 and bus 4742 including the taps to buses 4099 and 4672.  The loads normally served by these taps would be served by means of low-side rollover to buses 4100 and 4671 on Circuit 21.  This is the type of situation for which multi-section lines are used to accurately model load flows.

 
Figure 1.  Example of circuits needing to use multi-section line modeling.

Figure 2 represents a power-flow data model of the circuits in Figure 1.  Branch data record would have included the following:
4001,4099,09,…
4099,4672,09,…
4672,4742,09,…
4001,4100,21,…
4100,4671,21,…
4671,4742,21,…
along with the necessary bus, load, and shunt data.  To identify these two circuits as multi-section lines, entries must be made in the raw data input file.  The multi-section line data record format is as follows:
                    
 
I,J,ID,DUM1,DUM2, … DUM9  where :

I	“From bus” number.
J	“To bus” number. 
ID	Two characters multi-section line grouping identifier. The first character must be an ampersand (“&”).  ID = ‘&1’ by default.
DUMi	Bus numbers, or extended bus name enclosed in single quotes, of the “dummy buses” connected by the branches that comprise this multi-section line grouping. No defaults allowed.

Up to 10 line sections (and 9 dummy buses) may be defined in each multi-section line grouping.  A branch may be a line section of at most one multi-section line grouping.

Each dummy bus must have exactly two branches connected to it, both of which must be members of the same multi-section line grouping.

The status of line sections and type codes of dummy buses are set such that the multi-section line is treated as a single element.

 
Figure 2. Power-flow model of example circuits.

For our example, the following would be entered as multi-section line data records:
4001, 4742, &1, 4099, 4672
4001, 4742, &2, 4100, 4671
Multi-section lines give a great amount of flexibility in performing contingency studies on SSWG Cases.  When set up correctly, where automatic low-side load rollover occurs, hundreds of contingencies can be analyzed and reported within minutes.

4.4.3	Coordination of Tie Lines 
A tie line is defined as any transmission circuit with multiple owners represented within the context of the transmission circuit’s associated facility.  As used here, a transmission circuit’s associated facility includes all terminal buses as well as the transmission branch, transformer, bus section, or another electrical component connecting systems together.  For a tie line, each of the interconnected entities (TSP/TSP or TSP/RE) owns one or more elements of the tie line’s associated facility.

Careful coordination and discussion is required among SSWG members to verify all modeled tie line data.  Even in situations where no new tie lines are added to a network model, there could be many tie line changes.  Construction timing for future points of interconnection or modified existing points of interconnection can change.  As a result, a tie line may need to be deleted from some cases and added to others (e.g. deleted from spring cases and added to summer cases).  Additionally, a new substation installed in the middle of an existing tie line can redefine the tie line’s bus numbers, mileages, impedances, ratings, or ownership. 

Tie line models also affect a number of important ERCOT calculations and therefore must accurately reflect real-world conditions.  Missing, redundant, or erroneous tie line models can produce unrealistic indications of stability and/or voltage limits.  Inaccurate impedances, ratings, transformer adjustment data, status information, mileages, or ownership data can all have a profound effect on system studies.  Therefore, it is imperative that neighboring entities exercise care in coordinating tie line data. 
Ratings for tie lines should be mutually agreed upon by all involved entities and should comply with NERC Reliability Standards. 

It is imperative for neighboring entities to coordinate tie line data in order to allow Planning Case work activities to proceed unimpeded. Entities should exchange tie-line data at least two weeks before the data is due to ERCOT. Coordination of tie line data includes timely agreement between entities on the following for each tie line:
•	In-service/ out-service dates for ties
•	From bus number
•	To bus number
•	Circuit identifier
•	Impedance and charging data
•	Ratings
•	Transformer adjustment (LTC) data
•	Status of branch
•	Circuit miles
•	Ownership (up to four owners)
•	Entity responsible for submitting data  

OSRs can be submitted separately into NMMS/MAGE but for PMCRs in MOD only one set of ratings can be submitted.  Impedance and length are only allowed to have one submission, the majority owner of the tie line should submit this data to NMMS/MAGE and MOD and ensure that they are accounting for any other modeling information for connecting entities.

 
4.4.4	Metering Point
Each tie line or branch has a designated metering point and this designation may also be coordinated between neighboring TSP areas.  The location of the metering point determines which TSP area will account for losses on the tie branch.  PSS®E software allocates branch losses to the TSP area of the un-metered bus.  For example, if the metering point is located at the “to” bus then branch losses will be allocated to the TSP area of the “from” bus.  The first bus specified in the branch record is the default location of the metering point unless the second bus is entered as a negative number. These are the first and second data fields in the branch record.

4.5	Transformer Data
4.5.1	Use of Transformer Record Data Fields 
All existing and planned transformers are to be represented in the SSWG Cases.  Transformer data records specify all the data necessary to model transformers in power flow calculations.  Both two winding transformers and three winding transformers can be specified in the SSWG Cases. 
4.5.1.1	Bus Specifications
The end points of each transformer in the SSWG Cases are specified by “winding 1” and “winding 2” bus numbers.  In some cases, the “winding 1” and “winding 2” buses used to specify a transformer are in two different TSP areas, making the transformer a tie line (See Section 4.4.3, Coordination of Tie Lines). Three winding transformers (transformers with a tertiary winding) can be represented by specifying a “winding 3” bus number in the data to represent the tertiary winding.
4.5.1.2	Transformer Circuit Identifier
Circuit identifiers are limited to two alphanumeric characters. Each TSP will determine its own naming convention for circuit identifiers. Actual transformer identifiers may be used for circuit identifiers for transformers, however, typically, circuit identifiers are used to indicate which transformer is being defined when more than one transformer is modeled between two common buses. TSP’s can identify autotransformers with the letter A as the first character of the ID field.  Generator Step-Up transformers can be identified with the letter G.  Phase-shifting transformers can be identified with the letter P.
4.5.1.3	Impedance and Admittance Data
The resistance and reactance data for transformers in the SSWG Cases can be specified in one of three ways: (1) in per-unit on 100 MVA system base (default), (2) in per-unit on winding base MVA and winding bus base voltage, (3) in transformer load loss in watts and impedance magnitude in per-unit on winding base MVA and winding bus base voltage.  Transformer resistance and reactance data supplied from the Topology Processor are specified in per-unit on 100 MVA system base.
4.5.1.3.1	Resistance 
Transformer test records should be used to calculate the resistance associated with a transformer record. Where transformer test records are unavailable, the resistance should be entered as either a value similar to a comparable transformer or zero.
4.5.1.3.2	Reactance
Transformer test records or transformer nameplate impedance should be used to calculate the reactance associated with a transformer record. Where the transformer resistance component is known, the transformer reactance is calculated on the same base using the known data and the reactance component is determined using the Pythagorean Theorem. Where the transformer resistance is assumed to be zero, the calculated transformer reactance can be assumed to be equal to the transformer impedance.
4.5.1.3.3	Susceptance
For power-flow modeling purposes, the transformer susceptance is always assumed to be zero.

 
4.5.1.4	Transformer Ratings
The ratings used for transformer are defined the same as the ratings used for branches described in Section 4.4.1.4.
4.5.1.5	Status
Transformer data records include a field for status.  Entities are allowed to submit transformer data with an out-of-service status for equipment normally out of service.   
4.5.1.6	Ownership
Up to four owners and corresponding percent ownership can be specified for each transformer in the SSWG Cases. Owner IDs and corresponding percent ownership should be included for all transformers. The sum of all percent ownerships should equal 100% for every transformer.
4.5.1.7	Angle
In PSS®E, the phase shift across a two-winding transformer is specified by an angle referenced to the winding defined as “winding 1” by the combined logic of the “From Bus Number”, “To Bus Number” and “Winding 1 Side” (From or To logic) fields.  The phase shift angle is positive when the voltage of the bus corresponding to the referenced winding leads the voltage of the bus connected to the opposite winding.

The phase shift(s) associated with a three-winding transformer is(are) accounted for by the specification of an angle for each of the three windings.  The phase shift angle across a winding is positive when the voltage of the corresponding bus leads the voltage of the star point bus.

The transformer phase shift angle is measured in degrees for both two-winding and three-winding transformers.
4.5.1.8	Tap Data
All transformer tap characteristics should be appropriately modeled.  Such tap characteristics include no-load tap settings and load tap changing (LTC) properties and associated control settings.
4.5.1.8.1	Ratio
The ratio is defined as the transformer off nominal turns ratio and is entered as a non-zero value, typically in per unit. Where the base kV contained in the bus data records for the buses connected to transformer terminals are equal to the rated voltage of the transformer windings connected to those terminals, the transformer off-nominal ratio is equal to 1.00. When the transformer has no-load taps, the transformer off-nominal ratio can be something other than 1, but is usually in the range of 0.95 to 1.05. The effects of load tap changing (LTC) transformer taps are also handled in the transformer data record. 
4.5.1.8.2	Control Mode
This field enables or disables automatic transformer tap adjustment. Setting this field to a value other than zero (“None” within PSS®E) enables automatic adjustment of the LTC or phase shifter as specified by the adjustment data values during power-flow solution activities. Setting this field to zero prohibits automatic adjustment of this transformer during the power-flow solution activities.
4.5.1.8.3	Controlled Bus
The bus number of the bus whose voltage is controlled by the transformer LTC and the transformer turns ratio adjustment option of the power-flow solution activities. This record should be non-zero only for voltage controlling transformers.
4.5.1.8.4	Transformer Adjustment Limits
These two fields specify the upper and lower limits of the transformer’s turns ratio adjustment or phase shifter’s angle adjustment.  For transformers with automatic tap changer adjustments, these fields are typically populated with values in the range of 0.80 to 1.20 per-unit.  For phase-shifting transformers, these fields may be populated with phase angle adjustment ranges up to +/- 180 degrees, but are typically modeled with values in the range of +30 to -30 degrees.
4.5.1.8.4.1	Upper Limit (Rmax)
This field defines the maximum upper limit of the off-nominal ratio for voltage or reactive controlling transformers and is typically entered as a per-unit value. The limit should take into account the no-load tap setting of the transformer, if applicable. For a phase shifting transformer, the value is entered in degrees.
4.5.1.8.4.2	Lower Limit (Rmin)
Similar to the upper limit, this field defines the lower limit of the off-nominal ratio or phase shift angle for the transformer defined.

4.5.1.8.5	Voltage or Power-Flow Limits
These two fields specify the upper and lower voltage limits at the controlled bus or for the real or reactive load flow through the transformer at the tapped side bus before automatic LTC adjustment will be initiated by the power-flow program. As long as bus voltage, or real power flow for phase shifting transformers, is between the two limits, no LTC adjustment will take place during the power-flow solution activities.
4.5.1.8.5.1	Upper Limit (Vmax)
This field specifies the upper limit for bus voltage in per unit at the controlled bus or for the reactive load flow in MVAR at the tapped side bus. For a phase shifting transformer, this field specifies the upper limit for the real power load flow in MW. Direction for power flow across the phase shifting transformer is referenced from the bus side defined as the “Winding 1” bus.  Negative upper (and lower) limit values for phase shifting transformers imply power flow from the “Winding 2” bus to the “Winding 1” bus.
4.5.1.8.5.2	Lower Limit (Vmin)
Similar to the upper limit, this field specifies the lower limit for the bus voltage or the real or reactive load flow for the transformer defined.
4.5.1.8.6	Tap Positions Step
Transformer test records or nameplate data should be used to identify the number of tap positions available for a transformer’s LTC, along with the corresponding maximum and minimum turns ratio adjustment capabilities (i.e. Rmax and Rmin).  The transformer’s turns ratio step increment for a LTC can be calculated based upon data present in the “Tap Positions”, “Rmax”, and “Rmin” fields of the transformer’s PSS®E model.  A common range for a LTC turns ratio step increment is +/- 10 % over 33 tap positions (32 steps), which corresponds to 5/8% or 0.00625 per unit voltage increment per tap step.
4.5.1.8.7	Table
The number of a transformer impedance correction table is specified by this field if the transformer's impedance is to be a function of either the off-nominal turns ratio or phase shift angle. SSWG Cases normally don’t use these tables and this field is set to zero by default.
4.5.1.9	Magnetizing Admittance
Magnetizing admittance data is not required for SSWG Cases and the values for each of these two fields should be zero.
4.5.1.10	Load Drop Compensation
These two fields define the real and reactive impedance compensation components for voltage controlling transformers. They are ignored for MW and MVAR flow controlling transformers. SSWG Cases normally don’t use these fields and they are set to zero by default.
4.5.1.10.1	Resistive Component
The resistive component of load drop compensation entered in per unit is based on the resistance between the location of the LTC and the point in the system at which voltage is to be regulated.
4.5.1.10.2	Reactive Component
Similar to the resistive component of load drop compensation, this value is entered in per unit and is based on the reactance between the location of the LTC and the point in the system at which voltage is to be regulated.

4.6	Static Reactive Devices
All existing and planned static reactors and capacitors that are used to control voltage at the transmission level are to be modeled in the SSWG Cases to simulate actual transmission operation. There are two distinct static reactive devices currently represented in the SSWG Cases: shunt devices and series devices.
4.6.1	Shunt Devices
4.6.1.1	Switched Shunt Devices
A shunt capacitor or reactor located in a station for the purpose of controlling the transmission voltage can be represented in the SSWG Cases as a switched shunt device to accurately simulate operating conditions.  Care should be exercised when specifying the size of cap banks. Be sure that the rated size of the bank is for 1.0 per unit voltage.  Care should be taken to ensure that distribution level capacitors are not modeled in such a way as to be counted twice.
When a switched capacitor or reactor is submitted as the switched shunt data record, there are three modes that it can operate in: fixed, discrete, or continuous.  Switched capacitors are to be modeled in the mode in which they are operated.
A switched shunt can be represented as up to eight blocks of admittance, each one consisting of up to nine steps of the specified block admittance. The switched shunt device can be a mixture of reactors and capacitors.  The reactor blocks are specified first in the data record (in the order in which they are switched on), followed by the capacitor blocks (in the order in which they are switched on). The complex admittance (p.u.), the desired upper limit voltage (p.u.), desired lower limit voltage (p.u.), and the bus number of the bus whose voltage is regulated must be defined to accurately simulate the switched shunt device. A positive reactive component of admittance represents a shunt capacitor and a negative reactive component represents a shunt reactor. 
4.6.1.2	Fixed Shunt Devices
A shunt capacitor or reactor located in a station for the purpose of controlling the transmission voltage can be represented in the SSWG Cases as a fixed shunt device to accurately simulate operating conditions.  Care should be exercised when specifying the size of cap banks. Be sure that the rated size of the bank is for 1.0 per unit voltage.  Care should be taken to ensure that distribution level capacitors are not modeled in such a way as to be counted twice.

Multiple fixed shunts can be modeled at a bus, each with a unique ID.  These fixed shunts have a status that can be set to on or off.

A positive reactive component of admittance represents a shunt capacitor and a negative reactive component represents a shunt reactor.
 
4.6.1.3	Dummy Bus Shunt
If a switchable or fixed capacitor or reactor were connected to a transmission line instead of a station bus, an outage of the transmission line would also cause the capacitor or reactor to be taken out of service (see Figure 3).  For these instances, the most accurate model is the switched shunt modeled at a dummy bus connected by a zero impedance branch to the real station bus.  This dummy bus must have exactly two branches connected to it, both of which must be members of the same multi-section line grouping.  The status of the line section is that the multi-section line is treated as a single element.  A shunt capacitor or reactor connected to a line but modeled as a shunt within a station will result in power-flow calculations for contingencies that differ from real operating conditions.

4.6.2	Series Devices
Series capacitors and reactors will be modeled as a series branch with the appropriate impedance. If a parallel bypass exists, it should be modeled as a zero impedance branch with the appropriate branch status indicating whether it is normally open or normally closed.

4.7	Dynamic Control Devices
All existing and planned FACTS devices shall be modeled in the SSWG Cases. There are a multitude of FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission System) devices currently available, comprising shunt devices, such as Static VAR Compensator (SVC), Static Compensator (STATCOM), series devices such as the Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC), combined devices such as the Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) and the Interline Power Flow Controllers (IPFC). These devices are being studied and installed for their fast and accurate control of the transmission system voltages, currents, impedance and power flow. They are intended to improve power system performance without the need for generator rescheduling or topology changes. These devices are available because of the fast development of power electronic devices.

PSS®E has the capability to model several different FACTS devices and their documentation is the best source for specific applications.

4.8	HVDC Devices
HVDC Devices allow a specified real power flow to be imposed on the DC link.  For base case operation, this should be set to the desired interchange across the DC tie.  Capacitors, filter banks and reactors should be modeled explicitly and switched in or out of service based on normal DC tie operation.  The HVDC model itself normally calculates reactive power consumption.

HVDC ties with external interconnections may be modeled by the use of either the Two Terminal DC Transmission Line Data or Voltage Source Converter DC Line Data.
4.8.1	Two Terminal DC Transmission Line Data
Conventional HVDC ties should be modeled using Two Terminal DC Transmission Line Data.  The Two Terminal DC Transmission Line Data model represents the HVDC terminal equipment, including any converter transformers, thyristors, and the DC link.  The model will calculate voltages, converter transformer taps, losses, and VA requirements, based upon the power transfer over the HVDC facility, and the terminal AC bus voltages. See PSS®E Manual for more information.

4.8.2	Voltage Source Converter (VSC) DC Line Data
Voltage Source Converter DC line data can be used to model DC ties that use the voltage source converter technology. See PSS®E Manual for more information.

4.9	Modeling of Resource and Transmission Outages

TSPs are responsible for entering known outages of equipment for which they are the modeling entity as normally open equipment in the applicable SSWG Case(s) in accordance with the accepted technical rationale.  ERCOT is responsible for submitting outages for resource and resource owned equipment using the Outage Scheduler to determine outages with duration of at least six months and will model the status in the applicable SSWG Case(s) in accordance with its transmission in-service date.
 
5	OTHER SSWG ACTIVITIES
5.1	Transmission Loss Factor Calculations
The transmission loss factors must be calculated according to Protocol Section 13. The loss factors are calculated using the seasonal SSWG Cases. The values are entered in the ERCOT settlements system to account for losses on the transmission system. Separate calculations are performed for the eight seasonal SSWG Cases: spring, summer, fall, and winter with an on and off peak for each season. 

The Non Opt In Entities (NOIE) that provide metering of their system load to the ERCOT settlement system by a set of ERCOT Polled Settlements Meters (EPS) that ‘ring’ their transmission system as defined in Protocol 13.4.1 have additional calculations performed for their transmission loss factors.

The NOIE that send extra data to ERCOT for the loss calculations have EPS settlement meters on all of their transmission lines that connect or “tie” their system to the rest of the ERCOT transmission network. For the ERCOT settlement process ERCOT calculates their load as the net of inflows minus the outflows from these EPS meters. However calculations must be performed to subtract out the losses on the transmission lines that are ‘inside’ their EPS meters. If this was not done then these NOIE loads would be too high relative to the other loads where EPS meters are at each delivery point. Other NOIE send EPS metering data from each delivery point so their load can be calculated by summing the individual points. Therefore the extra calculations are not necessary.

The process for creating the loss factors is outlined below.

1.	Send out a request to SSWG for any case updates, changes to NOIE bus ranges, and latest self serve data. NOIE’s that have a ‘ring’ of EPS meters must validate the PSS®E Metered End data in each of the cases. The PSS®E Metered End for a transmission facility that is not inside the ‘ring’ of EPS meters should be Metered ‘to’ the remote bus, and not Metered ‘to’ bus where the EPS meter is located.
2.	ERCOT updates the transmission loss factor spreadsheet.
3.	Send to SSWG for review and approval
4.	Send to ERCOT settlements (Settlement Metering Manager) to be put into the ERCOT settlement system and post at http://www.ercot.com/mktinfo/data_agg/index.html.     
5.2	Contingency Database
The ERCOT contingency database is a compilation of contingency definitions as submitted by the TSPs.  The exchange of information for the contingency database will only be communicated using an Excel spreadsheet with the columns as listed in the table below.  The table identifies the columns which the TSPs and ERCOT are responsible for populating.  ERCOT does not create or manually update the information submitted by the TSPs.  In an effort to produce a contingency list with complete and accurate data, ERCOT will run topology and data entry checks on submitted information to highlight submission errors that the TSPs will need to correct within a given timeline.  A review of the contingency database will be conducted with each SSWG case build.  ERCOT will accept updates to the contingency list outside of this review process as requested by the TSPs.  This section covers the approved format for submitting contingency definitions, the review process, and the validation rules ERCOT will implement to verify submissions.

* In addition, the steady state contingencies as described by the NERC TPL-001-5.1 Table 1, consist of definitions which may have multiple category classifications.  In this case, each category must be separated by a ‘/’. 
The procedure to update the contingency database is as follows: ERCOT will send out the current contingency list to SSWG members with invalid entries highlighted.
1.	TSPs will submit a complete list of contingency definitions with the necessary changes and additions within an agreed upon timeline and format for ERCOT to import into the existing database.
2.	Upon import, ERCOT will overwrite the previous list of definitions submitted by the TSP.
3.	ERCOT will verify that the changes were imported into the database and provide the TSPs with a change log which will list the contingency definitions that were updated, deleted or created.
4.	Steps 1 to 4 will be repeated for each pass of the contingency update process.
5.	When the contingency list is finalized, ERCOT will post the list on the MIS website along with the contingency files created for use with MUST, PSS®E, PowerWorld, UPLAN and VSAT.  Definitions which are flagged as being invalid will NOT be included in the contingency file.
6.	The planning or extreme event rationale will be provided in supporting documentation from TSPs upon request.

A TSP may only submit changes for their company and rows with null values in either the Submitter or TOContingencyID columns will be ignored.  The default value listed in the table will be used upon import if the provided value is either invalid or missing.  Topology and data entry checks will be completed on the imported rows to highlight invalid contingency definitions.

ERCOT will utilize the latest available SSWG Cases to verify that the devices listed in the contingency definition exist in the SSWG Cases.  Additional columns will be added to the spreadsheet which will correspond to the filename of the SSWG Case used to validate the submissions.  The start and stop dates of the contingency definitions will be used to determine which SSWG Cases they need to be compared against.  Any inconsistencies between the case and contingency definition will be communicated in these columns.  A contingency definition will be highlighted as invalid and an error message will be printed if it fails any of the following data entry or topology checks.

NERC contingencies not covered by automatic contingency processing capabilities of the various power-flow applications, which the TSP deems to have an impact on the power-flow solution, shall be submitted.

NERC contingencies must either be submitted in entirety by each TSP or as a minimum, those planning event and extreme event NERC contingency categories that would produce the more severe system results or impacts. The rationale for the contingencies selected for evaluation shall be available as supporting information upon request. 

In addition to the aforementioned NERC defined contingencies, TSPs shall also submit:
•	A common tower outage as defined in Section 4.1.1.1 of the ERCOT Planning Guides.  These contingency scenarios will be categorized in the ERCOT contingency database as ERCOT_1.
•	A common tower outage as defined in Section 4.1.1.1 of the ERCOT Planning Guides where both circuits must be taken out of servce for a maintenance outage. These contingency scenarios will be categorized in the ERCOT contingency database as ERCOT_98.
•	Single and multiple element contingencies, not covered by automatic contingency processing capabilities of the various power-flow applications and not fitting the definition of ERCOT_1, for transmission facilities between 60 kV and 100 kV that produce the most severe system results or impacts.  These will be categorized in the ERCOT contingency database as ERCOT_NonBES.

ERCOT shall submit:
•	Loss of an entire combined cycle plant are to be categorized as ERCOT_CCT. 

Contingency definitions shall take into account the effects of existing and planned protection systems, including any backup or redundant systems.


General Data Entry Checks

Error Message	Reason for Failing Data Validation
Duplicate	The device is listed more than once in the contingency definition.
Needs Consistent Name	For each unique TOContingencyID, only one ContingencyName can be used. 
Invalid Date Selection	Either the start and/or stop dates for a single contingency definition are inconsistent or the start date occurs after the stop date.  In the case where a single contingency definition has inconsistent start dates, use the one that occurs furthest in the future since the contingency definition will not be valid until all devices listed in the contingency are present in the base case.  The start date is used to determine when the contingency definition becomes valid—it is not the energization date for the device listed on that row.
Invalid Bus Selection	The same bus number is used twice in the same row, or a needed bus number is missing.
Invalid Element Identifier	Element Identifier is invalid. The only acceptable values are Bus, Branch, Gen, Transformer, Fixed_Bus_Shunt, or Switched_Shunt
NERC Category Missing	The new NERC Category is missing.  The only acceptable values are ‘NERC Category’‘.’‘Event’ defined in TPL-001 Table 1.  Multiple Category contingencies are must be separated by ‘/’.  For example: P2.2/P4.3/P5.2
ERCOT Category Missing	The ERCOT Category is missing.  The only acceptable values are ERCOT_1, ERCOT_NonBES, ERCOT_CCT, ERCOT_98, or N/A.

Topology Checks

Error Message	Reason for Failing Data Validation
FromBus_i Missing, ToBus_j Missing, ToBus_k Missing	A bus with the corresponding bus number cannot be found in the base case.
Branch Missing	A branch with the submitted combination of bus numbers and circuit ID cannot be found in the base case.
System Switching Device Missing	A system switching device with the submitted combination of bus numbers and circuit ID cannot be found in the base case.
Transformer Missing	A transformer with the submitted combination of bus numbers and circuit ID cannot be found in the base case.
Generator Missing	A generator with the submitted combination of bus numbers and circuit ID cannot be found in the base case.
Shunt Missing	A shunt with the submitted combination of bus numbers and circuit ID cannot be found in the base case.

5.3	Review of NMMS and Topology Processor Compatibility with PSS®E
From time to time, updated versions of PSS®E may require modifications to the methods of extracting necessary power-flow data from NMMS.  For every PSS®E version change, the following evaluation process shall be followed:

1.	Use PSS®E documentation such as release notes and compatibility references to identify new fields and record formats added to a new version of PSS®E.
2.	SSWG determines which, if any, of the new fields or records need to be implemented in NMMS and Topology Processor.
a.	Determine how to use MOD to implement most needed fields immediately
3.	ERCOT determines approximate implementation method, initial impact analysis and cost of implementation for each new field and/or record determined by the SSWG to be necessary for implementation.
a.	Determine method to arbitrate disagreement on proposed recommendation
4.	Present to ROS new fields and/or records that have been jointly determined to be needed, with approximate implementation method, initial impact analysis and cost of implementation.
5.	Upon ROS approval, prepare Project initiation to create and add projects to PPL.
6.	Upon addition to PPL above cut line, prepare requirements documents to describe data type addition/changes to NMMS and Topology Processor output desired for example input.
5.4	Planning Data Dictionary
The Planning Data Dictionary is used by ERCOT to show correlation between SSWG Case bus numbers and TSP area SCADA names.  Additionally, the Planning Data Dictionary without the SCADA names is included as part of ERCOT’s FERC 715 filing.  

The exchange of information for the Planning Data Dictionary will only be communicated using an Excel spreadsheet with the columns as listed in the table below.  The table identifies the columns which the TSPs and ERCOT are responsible for populating.  ERCOT does not create or manually update the information submitted by the TSPs.  The Planning Data Dictionary will be updated with each SSWG Case build.

The format will be as follows (see next page):
 
Column Name	TSP Responsibility	ERCOT Responsibility	Description
TSP				Shortened version of SSWG Area
SSWG BUS NUMBER				Extracted from the SSWG Steady State Cases
SSWG BUS DATE IN				From the SSWG Steady State Cases, this is populated by searching for the earliest SSWG Steady State Case that the bus exists.  If the bus exists throughout all of the existing Steady State Cases, the field is left blank under the assumption that it already exists in the NMMS.
SSWG BUS DATE OUT			From the SSWG Steady State Cases, this is populated by searching for the latest SSWG Steady State Case that the bus exists.  If the bus exists throughout all of the existing SSWG Steady State Cases, the field is left blank under the assumption that it exists beyond the current planning scope.
SSWG BUS NAME			This is required by FERC for FERC 715 pt. 2 report and is extracted from the SSWG Steady State Cases.  
SSWG BASE KV			This is required by FERC for FERC 715 pt. 2 report and is extracted from the SSWG Steady State Cases

Appendix B
Methodology for Calculating Wind Generation levels in the SSWG Cases

Goal – Use available forecast data to set the dispatch for wind generation in the new SSWG Cases.

Section 3.2.6.2.2 of the Nodal Procotols 

WINDPEAKPCT s, r	%	Seasonal Peak Average Wind Capacity as a Percent of Installed Capacity—The average wind capacity available for the summer and winter Peak Load Seasons s and region r, divided by the installed capacity for region r, expressed as a percentage. The Seasonal Peak Average, derived from Settlement data, is first calculated as the average capacity during the 20 highest system-wide peak Load hours for a given year’s summer and winter Peak Load Seasons. The final value is the average of the previous ten eligible years of Seasonal Peak Average values. Eligible years include 2009 through the most recent year for which COP data is available for the summer and winter Peak Load Seasons.  If the number of eligible years is less than ten, the average shall be based on the number of eligible years available.  This calculation is limited to WGRs that have been in operation as of January 1 for each year of the period used for the calculation.
WINDCAP s, i, r	MW	Existing WGR Capacity—The capacity available for all existing WGRs for the summer and winter Peak Load Seasons s, year i, and region r, multiplied by WINDPEAKPCT for summer and winter Peak Load Seasons s and region r.



 
Appendix C
Mexico’s Transmission System in ERCOT SSWG Cases

This appendix provides an explanation of the modeling that represents Mexico’s Comisión Federal de Electridad (CFE) system in SSWG cases. A drawing of the system is at the end of this appendix.  All AEP and CFE facilities (bus, lines, etc.) tied to the CFE grid will be assigned to area 24 and zone 612.  The AEP facilities will retain the owner 9 and CFE will be assigned owner 300.

The following generation modeled in the power flow and short circuit cases are system equivalents of the CFE system and are located in Mexico. These units are not in ERCOT and should only be used for specialized studies. These units should not be included when performing transfer studies in ERCOT unless one is studying a transfer to or from CFE. The generation capability is not counted in ERCOT reports. These units are online in the cases to offset the real and reactive losses that are caused by the other CFE transmission facilities and reactive flow across the Laredo VFT and Railroad HVDC ties that are modeled in the SSWG cases.  Lines in CFE will not be included in the ERCOT contingency list.

Generation Station Name	Bus Number	Bus Voltage
CIDINDUS-138 (System Equivalent)	86104	138kV
CIDINDUS-230 (Swing Bus/Equivalent)	86105	230kV
CUF-230 (System Equivalent)	86106	230kV
CUF-138 (System Equivalent)	86107	138kV

The following are the transmission lines between Mexico and the United States.  All of the tie lines between CFE and ERCOT are operated normally open with the exception of the asynchronous ties at Laredo and Railroad.

Mexico	United States
Bus Name	Bus Number	Bus Voltage	Bus Name	Bus Number	Bus Voltage
Falcon	86111	138	Falcon	8395	138

Asynchronous Ties

Laredo

The Variable Frequency Transformer (VFT) in Laredo has a detailed model at busses 80170 (ERCOT Side), 80014 (ERCOT Side), 80169 (CFE Side), and 80165 (CFE Side) with a total transfer capability of 100 MW.  The VFT is tied to the CFE system by a 12.73 mile 230 kV transmission line and a 12.39 mile normally open 138 kV transmission line.  Both lines terminate at the CFE Ciudad Industrial Substation (86103 and 86104) and are breakered at each end.  There is also a normally open 138 kV transmission line between the Laredo Power Plant (8293) and the Laredo VFT (80169) that is utilized for emergency block load transfers between ERCOT and CFE.  The Laredo Power Plant to Laredo VFT 138 kV transmission line is breakered at both ends.

Railroad

The HVDC tie in Mission has a detailed model at busses 79604 (ERCOT Side) and 88254 (CFE Side) with a total transfer capability of 300 MW.  The Railroad HVDC is tied to the CFE system at Cumbres (86107) by an 11.79 mile 138 kV transmission line and is breakered at each end.  There is also a normally open bus tie that by-passes the HVDC that is utilized for emergency block load transfers between ERCOT and CFE.  The by-pass is breakered at both ends.


Normally Open Block Load Ties

Brownsville Switching Station

The Brownsville Switching Station (8332) is connected to the CFE Matamoras Substation (86113) by a 1.9 mile 69 kV transmission line and is breakered at each end.  The transmission line is operated normally open and is utilized for emergency block load transfers between ERCOT and CFE.

Military Highway

The Military Highway Substation (8339) is connected to the CFE Matamoras Substation (86112) by a 1.44 mile 138 kV transmission line and is breakered at each end.  The transmission line is operated normally open and is utilized for emergency block load transfers between ERCOT and CFE.

Frontera

The Frontera Power Plant (86114) is connected to the CFE Cumbres Substation (86107) by a 138 kV transmission line.  This transmission line is privately owned and operated by the owners of the Frontera Power Plant and is utilized to move the generation at Frontera Power Plant between the ERCOT and CFE systems. 

Falcon

The Falcon Substation (8395) is connected to the CFE Falcon Substation (86111) by a .3034 mile 138 kV transmission line and is breakered at each end.  The transmission line is operated normally open and is utilized for emergency block load transfers between ERCOT and CFE. 



Normally Open Block Load Ties on Distribution 
  
There are three normally open ties with CFE that are on the 12.47 kV distribution systems. These ties are at Amistad, Presido and Redford. These ties are only used for emergency block load transfers. Since SSWG does not model radial distribution systems these points are not in the SSWG power flow cases.

Appendix F 
 
Technical Rationale for Less limiting Facilities 
 
ERCOT and TSPs shall model Facility Ratings and System steady-state voltage limits (voltage-based Facility Ratings) that are equally limiting or more limiting than operational Facility Ratings and voltage limits developed in accordance with the ERCOT System Operating Limit (SOL) Methodology for the Operations Time Horizon, as represented in the MOD Base Case. Facility Ratings and voltage limits include, but are not limited to, bus voltage limits, transformer ratings, line ratings, breaker ratings, and switch ratings.

ERCOT or TSPs must provide one of the following technical rationale to model less limiting Facility Ratings or voltage limits in the SSWG Cases:

•	Transmission Project, for planned transmission projects that would modify transmission facilities. This category generally applies to the following PMCR types:
o	Tier 1, 2, 3, & 4
o	No_TPIT
o	Generation Interconnection
•	Data Corrections, for modeling adjustments to correct errors that cannot be corrected in the operational Facility Rating or voltage limit. This category generally applies to the following PMCR type:
o	Standard_PMCR
•	Data Updates, for data quality checks and updates for in-service equipment and to reflect as-built Facilities. This category generally applies to the following PMCR types:
o	NOMCR_Pending

Foreword
This Procedure Manual is intended for use by the stakeholder members of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) for the purpose of creating and maintaining the dynamics database and dynamics simulation cases which are used to evaluate the dynamic performance of the ERCOT system.  



 
Activities of the Dynamics Working Group (DWG)
	The DWG builds dynamic data sets and dynamic study cases for the ERCOT system from data supplied by equipment owners. ERCOT coordinates the compilation and publication of dynamics data and dynamics study cases. The dynamics data are published in the form of dynamics study cases (flat start cases) as described within this document.
	The DWG prepares the annual update of the Stability Book that documents dynamic data used in the flat start cases.
	The DWG provides a forum for discussing dynamic modeling and system dynamic performance issues and questions.
	The DWG performs other activities as directed by the Reliability and Operating Subcommittee (ROS).
Administrative Procedures
	Membership
The DWG is a non-voting working group whose members include representatives from ERCOT, Transmission Service Providers (TSPs), Texas Reliability Entity (Texas RE), and Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT).
Each NERC Transmission Planner within the ERCOT footprint and each ERCOT TSP with an assigned area in the Steady State Working Group (SSWG) and DWG base cases, shall have at least one designated DWG member.  The designated DWG member(s) shall be an employee(s) of an ERCOT Registered TSP. A Designated Agent that is not a DWG member may represent a DWG member.  Designated Agents are permitted on the DWG email exploder list at the discretion of the sponsoring DWG member under the stipulation that a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is in place with the sponsoring DWG member and proper notification has been provided to ERCOT. It is the responsibility of the sponsoring DWG member to inform ERCOT of Designated Agents acting on their behalf. It is also the responsibility of the sponsoring DWG member to inform ERCOT of Designated Agents that no longer represent them and to have them removed from the email exploder list. The DWG will review the participating Designated Agents annually.
DWG members and any Designated Agents shall be identified in the DWG roster, and the roster will be updated as needed by the DWG.  The DWG shall notify ROS (in the monthly report) of any TSPs that are required to have a designated DWG member but do not have a DWG representative identified on the DWG roster.

The DWG will nominate a chair and vice-chair to be approved by the ROS annually.

	Duties of Chair and Vice-Chair
The chair will coordinate the activities of the DWG and represent the DWG at the ROS meetings and other working group meetings as required.
The vice chair will support the chair and fulfill the duties of the chair in the absence of the chair.  
	Meetings
The DWG will meet at least quarterly. DWG meetings are closed meetings. DWG members and Designated Agents of DWG members may attend. If a Designated Agent is not on the DWG roster, the sponsoring DWG member shall inform ERCOT and the DWG chair and vice chair of the name of the Designated Agent attending one week prior to the meeting. 
The chair may coordinate additional meetings, including open meetings, as needed to facilitate the activities of the DWG. Non-DWG members may participate in DWG meetings including open portion of the meeting for specific purposes (e.g. a technical presentation or discussion).  Any such participation should be approved by the chair, limited to the specific purpose, announced in the meeting agenda, and recorded in the meeting minutes.  The vice chair will track attendance and document meeting minutes for in-person meetings.  
Agendas and meeting schedules should be published at least two weeks prior to the meeting. The minutes of each meeting will be distributed to DWG members.
	Reports to ROS
Each month, the DWG chair will provide a written report to the ROS if needed.
	Dynamic Data Sharing Rules
Dynamic data and dynamic study cases are considered confidential and protected information pursuant to Nodal Protocol Section 1.3, Confidentiality.  They shall be provided to the DWG members only.


 
Dynamic Data

	General
Dynamic data is the network data, mathematical models, and supporting information required for simulation of dynamic and transient events in the ERCOT System.     
	Software
The current planning model software is PSS/E version 35 and PSCAD version 4.5 or higher.  During years where a PSS/E version change is being conducted, the previous PSS/E version user defined models shall also be provided until a full transition is completed.  The current operations model software is Powertech DSATools™ Transient Security Assessment Tool (TSAT) version 22.
	Dynamic Models – General
Dynamic models compatible with the software(s) and version(s) listed in Section 3.1.1 shall be submitted to both ERCOT and the interconnecting TSP.  In addition to the requirements described in the Planning Guide Section 6.2, Dynamics Model Development, providers of dynamic models shall also adhere to the following requirements:
	Each dynamic device requires a model with model parameters that accurately represent the dynamics of the device over the entire range of operating conditions.
	Static switchable devices part of Inverter-Based Resource (IBR ) facilities (such as on-load tap changing transformers (OLTC) and switchable reactive shunts) should include an initialization script or logic to correctly initialize for the POI initial conditions of the power flow case the model is integrated in (for example, a Python file for PSS/e and initialization logic for PSCAD), and should include switching control logic if the device is expected to switch within 45 seconds of a disturbance .
	PSCAD models shall be submitted to ERCOT for all IBRs, Wind-powered Generation Resources (WGRs), and inverter-based transmission elements (IBTEs)  installed on or after January 2015; for equipment installed before 2015 PSCAD models shall be submitted to ERCOT upon request.  For purposes of this manual, IBTEs includes STATCOMs, static VAR compensators (SVCs), and other transmission devices with power electronic grid interfaces.
	Where multiple models are provided (e.g. PSS/E, TSAT, PSCAD), the model response shall be consistent across software platforms to the extent of platform capability.
	Dynamic models shall utilize proper memory management within the software.  Data must only be written to allocated memory locations so that other models within the system are not affected.
	All associated per unit dynamic model parameters for a given generating unit shall be provided using a base MVA (MBASE) in accordance with appropriate modeling techniques for the software platform, where the MBASE is typically the generator MVA rating.
	No model shall restrict the DWG from using any integration time-step less than or equal to a ¼ cycle in simulations when using positive sequence simulation tools.
	No model in the DWG’s Unacceptable Model List shall be used. Refer to Section 3.1.10.
	Standard Dynamic Models
The use of standard dynamic models provided by the software is preferred when they can accurately represent the dynamic performance of the device being modeled. 
	User-Written Dynamic Models
A user written model is any model that is not a standard library model within the software(s) and version(s) listed in Section 3.1.1.  When no compatible standard dynamic model(s) provided within the software can be used to represent the dynamics of a device, accurate and appropriate user written models can be used, if accepted by ERCOT and the DWG after being tested for compatibility with the flat start cases.  A model guideline checksheet is provided by ERCOT for PSS/E, TSAT and PSCAD models to help determine compatibility ; this checksheet shall be completed and submitted along with the model.  
PSS/E User-written models for the dynamic equipment and associated data must be in dynamic linked library (DLL) format and must include a model manual.  The model manual must show control block diagrams, design logic, descriptions of all model parameters, a list of which parameters are commonly tuned for site-specific settings, and a description of procedures for using the model in dynamic simulations.
TSAT User-written models for the dynamic equipment and associated data must be in TSAT User Defined Model (UDM) format and associated dynamic linked library (DLL) and template user-defined model (TUDM) if required. The TSAT UDM or DLL shall be able to directly read and support the PSS/E format data (.dyr file).  TSAT UDM models shall be provided with two cases:  one set up using bus numbers (the same numbers as a sample PSS/e case) and the other set up using equipment names.  The equipment name case should include a space character in the name to demonstrate that the model is compatible with space characters (an ERCOT systems requirement).
All PSCAD models are considered to be user-written models.
	Dynamic Model Quality Test Guideline
Submitted dynamic planning and operations models must be accompanied with results from model quality tests (MQT) performed by the facility owner as required in paragraph (5)(c) of Planning Guide Section 6.2.  These results shall include the case simulation files as well as the simulation plots of relevant quantities for each test.  When submitting PSS/E and PSCAD MQT files, include the leading and lagging power factor cases for the voltage ride-through tests.  Guidelines on how these tests should be performed and the expected model performance are provided in the following sub-sections. All tests are required for PSS/E, TSAT, and PSCAD models with the exception of the Phase Angle Jump Test in Section 3.1.5.9, which is only required for PSCAD models.  A sample report is posted under ‘Model Quality Guide’ on the ERCOT Resource Entity webpage . Plots of PSS/E, TSAT, and PSCAD test results should be overlaid onto the same plot axis for comparison.  However, TSAT model testing is not required for models utilizing a TSAT standard library model.

3.1.5.1 Simulation Set Up

To examine the dynamic performance of a Generation Facility or dynamic transmission element, all site-specific dynamic models needed to represent the facility shall be included in the test.  Unless otherwise specified, the following model guidelines apply:
	The facility model is connected to a controllable infinite bus whose voltage and frequency can be adjusted for testing.  No explicit ERCOT transmission system models are required for this testing.  The tests shall be performed with the current planning model software.
	For generation resources, the generator is dispatched at full real power output and the Point of Interconnection (POI) bus voltage is initialized to nominal 1.0 per-unit unless the test requires otherwise. Facilities that include energy storage systems should also be tested at full real power withdrawal. The initial reactive power exchange at the POI should be near zero unless the test requires otherwise.  
	Behind the POI, the generator(s) and step-up transformer(s) shall be represented along with any additional planned or installed static and dynamic reactive equipment.  
	Station transformer taps and static switched shunts should be initialized to a nominal position appropriate for the initial POI voltage and real power dispatch.
	Any switching controls that are expected to provide a response within 20 seconds (e.g. automatic switched shunts or on-load transformer tap changers) should be reflected in the dynamic model for the resource. 
	Aggregate Generation Resources, such as wind and solar, should be represented by a single equivalent aggregate model per registered Resource (i.e. allowed aggregation) and include a representation for the collector impedance and pad-mount transformer.  All dynamic control systems should be modeled (generator, exciter, governor, power system stabilizer, automatic voltage regulator, power plant controller, voltage and frequency protection, etc. as applicable).
	PSCAD models are not required to be aggregated to match resource registration.  However, PSS/E and TSAT models must match registration.
	Simulations should be run for a minimum of 20 seconds and show that the facility response has stabilized. 
Example test cases for an Inverter-Based Resource (IBR) with a STATCOM and a synchronous generator test case are shown below.
 

 
3.1.5.2 Flat Start Test
Perform a no-disturbance test of the prepared simulation case as described in Section 3.1.5.1 above for a minimum of 20 seconds.  Flat responses of voltage, MW, MVAR, and frequency, as shown in the figure below, are expected to remain very close to the initial system condition. 
 
3.1.5.3 Small Voltage Disturbance Test
Apply a 3% step increase, and in a separate simulation, a 3% step decrease of voltage at the POI.  The plant Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) and the associated droop and dead-band settings (if applicable) should transition the plant to/near maximum leading power factor , or in the latter case, to/near maximum lagging power factor in an attempt to regulate the original voltage set point.  Any oscillations should be well damped.  Real power output should be sustained throughout the small voltage disturbance tests.  The figures below include examples of acceptable and unacceptable responses.  
 

 
 
 

3.1.5.4 Large Voltage Disturbance Test: (Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) for IBRs, WGRs, and IBTEs)
All IBRs, WGRs, and IBTEs should test two profiles, both a “legacy” profile and a “voltage dip” profile as described below.  Testing both profiles helps provide important model performance information.
	The “legacy” Low Voltage Ride Through curve per Nodal Operating Guide (NOG) 2.9.1.2.
	The “voltage dip” test includes evaluation of NOG 2.9.1.1.  The test shall be run as a series of separate piece-wise disturbances with the voltage returning to 1.0 per-unit (pu) voltage after each disturbance (see below examples).  The spacing between each disturbance may be greater than 10 seconds to allow for recovery as necessary.  
Each voltage disturbance profile starts at 1.0 pu voltage.  The “legacy” curve ends at 0.90 pu voltage.  In the case of Resources, tests shall be performed for two initial conditions: with the facility operating at a 0.95 lagging power factor (at the POI) and with the facility operating at 0.95 leading power factor (at the POI) . The model shall exhibit appropriate dynamic reactive response, active current injection, AVR response, and the model shall not exhibit momentary cessation.
Additionally, the maximized LVRT capability as required in NOG 2.9.1.1(8) or NOG 2.9.1.2(8) shall be documented in a format similar to the tables in NOG 2.9.1.1(1) or NOG 2.9.1.2(1).

When testing the “legacy” profile, the following performance criteria apply:
	For the low voltage transient, the model should inject reactive current throughout the voltage recovery period.  At the POI, both P and Q are necessarily zero during zero voltage. Q injection at the POI should be observable immediately or very shortly after voltage begins ramp up from zero.
	For 0.9 pu sustained POI voltage, the AVR should provide voltage support that moves the resource towards nearly full reactive production (significantly lagging).
	Real power recovery should start prior to the POI voltage recovering to 0.9 pu.
	Real power should recover to full output within 1.0 seconds of POI voltage recovery to 0.9 pu.  A modest real power reduction  (typically 5% of Pmax or less) may be acceptable to accommodate greater terminal reactive power injection for sustained POI voltages in the range of 0.90 pu to 0.95 pu provided real power fully recovers when POI voltage returns to normal operating range (0.95-1.05 pu). An explanation, including a reference to any exempt status per ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide Section 2.9.1, , shall be provided for models which indicate that the unit trips or fails to meet any of the above performance criteria.




When testing the “voltage dip” profile, the following criteria applies:
	Resources not subject to the “preferred” Voltage Ride Through requirements of NOG 2.9.1.1 are only required to ride through the first dip of the below voltage dip profiles.  This first dip is within the “legacy” LVRT requirements of NOG 2.9.1.2.
	During the voltage dips:
	The model shall inject active current for POI voltage dips of 0.5 and higher. 
	Injections of significantly reduced active current for voltage dips 0.5 pu and 0.7 pu should be accompanied by increased reactive current.
	Reactive current injection at the POI shall be observable immediately or very shortly after a non-zero voltage dip is applied.
	After the voltage dips:
	Real power should recover to full output within 1.0 seconds of POI voltage recovery to 1.0 pu.
	An explanation, including a reference to any exempt status per ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide Section 2.9.1, shall be provided for models which indicate that the unit trips or fails to meet any of the above performance criteria.

Following are three figures:  The first illustrates the "Legacy” LVRT to be applied at the POI; the second illustrates the “voltage dip” LVRT voltage profile to be applied at the POI for photovoltaic generation resources (PVGRs) and energy storage resources (ESRs), and inverter-based transmission equipment, and the third illustrates the “voltage dip” LVRT voltage profile to be applied at the POI for wind generation resources (WGRs).

 

The figures below include the examples of acceptable and unacceptable responses:
 
 
 


 

3.1.5.5 Large Voltage Disturbance Test (High Voltage Ride-Through for IBRs, WGRs, and IBTEs) 
First, apply the “preferred” HVRT curve to the POI per NOG 2.9.1.  If the facility cannot meet the “preferred” ride through requirements, then additionally test the “legacy” HVRT curve and report both results. The “preferred” curve has more stringent requirements, so it is not necessary to test the “legacy” curve for devices passing the “preferred” curve, and such testing would generally not provide additional revelations regarding model behavior.  
Additionally, the maximized HVRT capability as required in NOG 2.9.1.1(8) or NOG 2.9.1.2(8) shall be documented in a format similar to the tables of NOG 2.9.1.1(1) and NOG 2.9.1.2(1).

The HVRT profiles start at 1.0 pu voltage and end at 1.1 pu.  The tests should be performed for two initial conditions: with the facility operating at 0.95 lagging power factor (at the POI) and with the facility operating at 0.95 leading power factor (at the POI). The model shall exhibit appropriate dynamic reactive response, active current injection, AVR response, and the model shall not exhibit momentary cessation.
The following criteria apply to both the “preferred” and “legacy” HVRT tests:
	During the high voltage transient, the model should provide a fast dynamic response to absorb reactive power.  The resource should be absorbing a significant amount of reactive power at the POI during the high voltage transient, and ideally within 0.5 seconds of the transient inception.
	For 1.1 pu sustained POI voltage, the AVR should move the resource towards nearly full reactive absorbing (significantly leading).
	Real power should be sustained during high voltage condition.  A modest real power reduction (typically 5% of Pmax or less) may be acceptable to accommodate  greater reactive power absorbed for sustained POI voltages in the range of 1.05 pu to 1.10 pu provided real power fully recovers when POI voltage returns to normal operating range (0.95-1.05 pu).
	An explanation, including a reference to any exempt status per ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide Section 2.9.1, shall be provided for models which indicate that the unit trips or fails to meet any of the above performance criteria.
The following two figures illustrate the “preferred” and the “legacy” HVRT voltage profiles applied at the POI.

 

The figures below include examples of acceptable and unacceptable responses.
 
 

 

3.1.5.6 Large Voltage Disturbance Test (for synchronous machines-based facilities including synchronous generators and synchronous condensers)
Apply a three-phase fault at the POI for 4 cycles (i.e. apply a step change to zero voltage at the POI for 4 cycles and then a step change back to nominal voltage).  The facility should inject reactive current during the fault.  Following the fault the facility should return to a stable operating point with full real power output.  Any oscillations should be well damped.

3.1.5.7 Small Frequency Disturbance Test (all facilities)
Apply a 0.3 Hz step increase, and in a separate simulation, a 0.3 Hz step decrease of system frequency from nominal frequency (60Hz).  The governor or frequency controller should lower or raise the real power dispatch according to the droop and deadband characteristic.  A frequency response is required for all Generation Resources and Energy Storage Resources (ESRs) assuming there is sufficient headroom to respond to frequency changes.  The real power should initially be dispatched at 80% of maximum for this test. Tests for ESRs should also be run for a condition at 80% of maximum charging capability.  Since Intermittent Renewable Resources (IRRs) typically operate in a power availability state (no headroom) state even when operating below nameplate capability, two frequency drop simulations shall be performed for IRRs:  One where the resource is modeled in a curtailed (with headroom) state at 80% dispatch, and another simulation where the resource is modeled in a power availability state (no headroom) at 80% dispatch.  A description of how to set up the IRR model for each case (headroom vs. no headroom) should be included.  Non-exempt IRR resource models operating with headroom should provide a real power increase in response to a frequency drop.  An explanation, including a reference to any exempt status per ERCOT Nodal Protocol 8.5.1 shall be provided for models that fail to exhibit sufficient frequency response.  In general, the submitted IRR model should reflect a power availability state (no headroom state) as that would be the normal operating assumption even when dispatched at less than Pmax.
The figures below include the examples of acceptable and unacceptable responses. 

 


 


 
3.1.5.8 System Strength Test (for Inverter-Based Resources, and Inverter-Based Transmission Elements)
This test considers the model performance under varying short circuit ratios (SCR).  The SCR of the electric grid can vary over time due to line contingencies, nearby generator status, etc., so it is important for a model to behave well under a range of SCR conditions.
The model shall be tested under at least four different short circuit ratios listed in the table below.  If there are concerns about model accuracy under certain lower short circuit ratios, a written explanation of the reason should be provided.

Test	SCR
1	5
2	3
3	1.5
4	1.2

Method for Testing SCR:
A test case is set up where the plant model POI is connected to a controllable infinite bus by a branch whose impedance can be programmatically changed during the simulation.  Initially, the branch impedance is set to Xpu where Xpu represents the per-unit reactance necessary to achieve the desired short circuit ratio.  After applying a 4 cycle bolted three phase fault to the POI, the branch impedance is changed to reflect a post-disturbance system with higher impedance.    A series of short circuit ratios can be tested in the same simulation by progressively increasing the value of Xpu, so long as sufficient run time is provided between changes for the model to reach steady state.


 
Calculation of Xpu, the Per-Unit Line Impedance:
The short circuit ratio is defined as the measured short circuit MVA (MVAfault) contribution from the system divided into the total generator MW capacity.  The measured short circuit MVA is defined as the short circuit current contribution from the system multiplied by the nominal system voltage.  Refer to the formula below, assuming a system base MVA of 100.

SCR=〖MVA〗_Fault/〖MW〗_Capacity 

SCR=(100⁄X_pu )/〖MW〗_Capacity 

Rearranging,
X_pu=100/(〖MW〗_Capacity*SCR)

Where
〖MW〗_Capacity= Total MW capacity of generator(s) under study
SCR	= Desired short circuit ratio to test
Xpu 	= Per unit line reactance, on a 100 MVA system base

Example:
	A wind farm consisting of one-hundred 2.0 MW wind turbines is to be tested under short circuit ratios of 5, 3, 1.5, and 1.2.  Thus, for the windfarm,
	〖MW〗_Capacity= 200 MW	

	Using the equation above, the line impedance (Xpu) is calculated for each of the test short circuit ratios.
	When testing SCR = 5, the line reactance is Xpu = 0.1
	When testing SCR = 3, the line reactance is Xpu = 0.17
	When testing SCR = 1.5, the line reactance is Xpu = 0.33
	When testing SCR = 1.2, the line reactance is Xpu = 0.42

For each increase in line reactance, the plant reactive power controller should adjust to restore voltage schedule and compensate for the increase in reactive losses. After applying the fault disturbance, the Xpu is modified to a value corresponding to the next lower SCR level to be tested.  Models shall provide acceptable responses for an SCR of 3 and higher.  If the responses are not acceptable for an SCR of 1.5, then a technical reason for the limitation should be provided, and a model enhancement should be considered.
The figures below include examples of acceptable and unacceptable responses. 

 
 

 
3.1.5.9 Phase Angle Jump Test (for Inverter-Based Resources)
This test considers the model performance under a sudden increase or decrease in voltage phase angle as can sometimes occur on the electrical grid under disturbances.  The test consists of exposing the model to an instantaneous voltage phase angle increase, and separately, an instantaneous voltage phase angle decrease, to determine the maximum phase angle jump the model can withstand and still remain online and recover to normal operation.  For example, the test can be conducted starting with a 180 degree jump, and if the model cannot ride through, decreasing by 30 degrees each time until the model is able to ride through.  This test is only required for PSCAD models of inverter-based resources.

3.1.5.10 Model Test Setup and Description for AGS-ESR
The following sections 3.1.5.11 – 3.1.5.15 outline test procedures and associated criteria to examine and verify functionality for AGS-ESR. The flat start (defined in section 3.1.5.1) and large voltage disturbance tests (defined in Sections 3.1.5.4 and 3.1.5.5) are applicable to AGS-ESR, while Sections 3.1.5.11-3.1.5.15 contains modified and new tests specific to AGS-ESR: small voltage disturbance, frequency change and inertia response, system strength, and phase angle jump tests, as well as loss of synchronous machine test. 

Any quantities showing oscillations resulting from a test should demonstrate a controlled, damped response. Required plots for all tests include the relevant test profile, POI voltage, and the active/reactive power of the plant with appropriate axis resolution to demonstrate all performance criteria.

3.1.5.11 AGS-ESR Small Voltage Disturbance Test
In this test, a step change is applied to the voltage magnitude of the controlled source so that the reactive power response time and magnitude can be measured. The purpose of this test is to demonstrate the capability of resisting changes in voltage magnitude. The test system should be set up to have zero impedance (Zth) between the ideal voltage source and the POI. The initial dispatch of the ESR should be set to its maximum discharging for active power, with approximately zero reactive power.  The figure below illustrates the voltage magnitude profile applied to an ideal source at the POI.
 
The following performance criteria apply:
	The instantaneous reactive power output of the plant should quickly respond to oppose the voltage step change for each of the step changes, with an initial peak reactive power change of at least 0.03 pu on the rated power base (e.g., A 100 MVA rated plant with 0 MVAR initial output should instantaneously increase reactive power output from 0 MVAr to at least 3 MVAr when source voltage magnitude is decreased by 3%.). 

	The reactive power should not return to the pre-disturbance level within 6 cycles. 

	The response time to 90% of the initial change in instantaneous reactive power should occur within 1 cycle. 

	After each step change resulting in POI voltage above or below the nominal value, the reactive power should start to transition toward the maximum reactive capability of the plant in an attempt to regulate the original voltage set point.

 

3.1.5.12 AGS-ESR Frequency Change and Inertia Response Test
This test is to evaluate the active power response of the ESR and to estimate its inertia response to frequency change. The test system should be set up with a SCR of 3 at the connection point and with a X/R ratio of 6. The initial dispatch of ESR should be set to zero for active power with approximately zero reactive power
The figure below illustrates the frequency profile applied to the source at the POI, with initial ramps of 1 Hz/s followed by 0.3 Hz steps which is the same test for the existing IBRs.
 
The following performance criteria apply:
	Plant real and reactive power output should be well controlled. The frequency and voltage should not oscillate excessively or deviate from steady-state levels for any significant amount of time. 

	Voltage should settle to a stable operating point when the frequency is not ramping 

	The equivalent inertia constant, as calculated below, should be greater than 2.5 s. 

	H ≈ 60 * ∆E [s], where: ∆E is the area under the per unit active power production of the ESR from 0 to 0.5 s, when the RoCoF is 1 Hz/s. 

	Active power should settle according to its frequency droop and deadband settings when the frequency has settled. 

 

3.1.5.13 AGS-ESR System Strength Test
This test is similar to the existing system strength test for all IBRs, but AGS-ESR shall demonstrate a stable response for all tested SCR values from 10 down to 1.2. The test system should be set up with a SCR of 10 at the connection point with a X/R ratio of 6. The initial dispatch of ESR should be set to the max discharging for active power with approximately zero reactive power.

The model shall be tested under the short circuit ratios listed in the table below.  As in the case of non-AGS-ESR, a 3-phase, bolted, 4-cycle fault is applied just before each SCR transition. The SCR transition occurs at fault clearing time.
Test	SCR
1	10
2	5
3	3
4	1.5
5	1.2




The following performance criteria apply:
	Plant real and reactive power output and RMS voltage should be well controlled

	The plant shall not trip nor reduce power (outside of the fault period) for any extended period of time for all tested SCR range from 10 to 1.2.

 

3.1.5.14 AGS-ESR Phase Angle Jump Test
This test examines the capability to maintain the voltage phasor and ability to resist an angle change. In addition, it ensures stable behavior under different angle step changes when an ESR is working close to its maximum current limit. For large angle changes forcing the controls beyond their maximum current limits, the ESR should be stable and should not degrade the performance of the power grid. The test system should have a SCR of 3 at the connection point with a X/R ratio of 6. Initial dispatch of ESR should be set to the max discharging for active power with approximately zero reactive power. This phase angle jump test must be conducted using PSCAD.

The figure below illustrates the voltage angle profile applied at the 3-phase ideal voltage source.
 

The following performance criteria apply:
	The instantaneous active power output of the plant should quickly respond to oppose the angle change with the peak active power change being at least 0.2 pu (based on the rated active power) for each 10-degree voltage phase angle change, in the opposing direction. (e.g., A 100 MW rated plant should temporarily decrease active power output from 100 MW to 80 MW, or below, when source voltage angle is increasing 10 degrees; and it should temporarily increase active power from 100 to at least 120 MW, if the current limit allows, when voltage source angle is decreased by 10 degrees.). 

	For the 25-degree voltage phase angle change, the instantaneous active power output of the plant should quickly respond to oppose the angle change with the peak active power change being at least 0.5 pu (based on the rated active power) in the opposing direction. If the criterion is not met for the 25-degree angle change, the rationale should be documented. 

	The active power should not return to the pre-disturbance level for at least 3 cycles. 

	The response time to 90% of the initial change in instantaneous active power should occur within one cycle. 

	If the current limit in the inverter is reached when the angle jump is applied, the performance criteria described above may not apply. However, the active power must return to the pre-disturbance level in a stable manner. 



 

3.1.5.15 AGS-ESR Loss of Synchronous Machine Test
The purpose of this test is to confirm the ability of an AGS-ESR to form voltage and work in parallel with a nearby AGS-ESR. It is not intended to examine the black start capability of AGS-ESR nor to require ESRs operate continuously on a grid without synchronous resources. 
This test utilizes a duplicate of the AGS-ESR under test to represent the neighboring plant. The synchronous source can be represented by a voltage source or any source with sufficiently high inertia and low impedance compared to the AGS-ESR under study.
Using the testbench shown in the figure below, with a constant impedance load (L) and a power factor of 0.95 lag, along with the project plant initial dispatch (P1), the duplicated plant initial dispatch (P2), and the load value, the following three scenarios must be tested:
	Scenario 1: 
P1 = 0.3 pu discharging, P2 = 0.1 pu discharging, and L = 1.3 pu
	Scenario 2: 
P1 = 0.6 pu charging, P2 = 0.4 pu charging, and L = 0.7 pu
	Scenario 3: 
P1 = 0, P2 = 1 pu discharging, and L = 1.65 pu
Note: The dispatch and load values are provided based on the project plant rating.

Simulate the system until a stable response is reached for the given scenario, ensuring that no oscillations occur, then disconnect the voltage source (without fault) and continue the simulation for at least 10 seconds. Plots of the active and reactive power of the ESR, duplicate ESR, load, and voltage source as well as POI frequency should be provided.

 

The following performance criteria apply:
	Immediately following the disconnection of voltage source, both AGS-ESRs output should be well controlled and exhibit stable response.  

	System frequency and voltage should settle to a stable operating point (within 5 seconds) and be completely damped within 10 seconds.

	Active and reactive power from each plant should move immediately to meet the load requirement, while response time to 90% of initial change should occur within one cycle.

	Active and reactive power from each plant should settle according to its droop setting.

 
3.1.6 Unit Model Validation
PSCAD models must be accompanied with results from the unit model validation tests performed by the Interconnecting Entity or Resource Entity as required in paragraph (5)(d) of Planning Guide Section 6.2.  These validations shall demonstrate the accuracy of the PSCAD models against actual inverter testing and should be performed for all inverter-based device types within the facility.  The test report should clarify if the inverter is capable of meeting AGS-ESR requirements and that these control settings are enabled. The tests are inverter specific but need not be site-specific.  The report should include a description of the test set up as well as the simulation plots of relevant quantities for each test.   Guidelines on how these tests should be performed and the expected model performance are provided in the following sub-sections.


3.1.6.1 PSCAD Model Setup

Because the purpose of validation is to test the PSCAD inverter model, it is not necessary to model any balance-of-plant equipment, transformers, collector system, power plant controllers, etc., however any auxiliary inverter-based equipment should also be tested (for example, STATCOMs). In simulation software, the PSCAD model(s) should be connected to a controllable voltage source whose voltage and frequency can be adjusted for testing. The inverter should be dispatched at full real power unless the test requires otherwise.  Energy storage devices should be tested under both charging and discharging modes.  Simulations should be run for a minimum of 10 seconds.

3.1.6.2 Inverter Hardware Testbench Setup

The testbench should utilize actual inverter hardware programmed with typical default settings.  Thus the test should be representative for all inverter devices under the same hardware and control implementation.
 

3.1.6.3 Testing

The tests are designed to measure the inverter and model response to small and large magnitude disturbances of frequency and voltage as well as the subsynchronous response to gauge model accuracy.  Many of the tests closely parallel those used in the Model Quality Guideline Section 3.1.5.  Alternative testing methods may be permissible if the objective is fulfilled.  The following tests should be performed on both the PSCAD model and the actual inverter hardware:

	Step change in voltage, as specified in Section 3.1.5.3
	Voltage Ride Through, as specified in Section 3.1.5.4 and 3.1.5.5.
	System Strength Test similar to Section 3.1.5.9.  
	Voltage Angle Step Test as in Section 3.1.5.10.
	Subsynchronous Test:  Perform a frequency scan sweep to measure the subsynchronous impedance as seen looking into the inverter over the range 5 to 55 Hz in 1 Hz increments.  This test is generally conducted by adding a small voltage perturbation of variable frequency superimposed on the fundamental (60 Hz) voltage, and measuring the complex impedance as seen looking into the inverter.  The results should be provided both as a plot and as a table and should display Resistance and Reactance plotted over 5 to 55 Hz.  Values should be in per-unit on the inverter MVA base.  This test should be conducted under the following conditions:  Strong system (short circuit ratio = 10), unity power factor, Weak System Lagging (short circuit ratio = 1.5, 0.95 lagging power factor), and Weak System Leading (short circuit ratio = 1.5, 0.95 leading power factor).  


	Maintenance of Dynamic Models
Maintenance of the models is the responsibility of the device owner. Models shall be maintained in accordance with Section 3.2.  Any user-written dynamic models shall also be maintained to fulfill the requirements as described in the Planning Guide Section 6.2 and Section 3.1.4 in this manual.
	Dynamic Data for Existing Equipment
“As-built” data is required for all completed facilities in accordance with Section 3.2.  To help ensure that dynamic model data is kept up to date with site-specific settings, paragraph (5)(b) of Planning Guide Section 6.2 introduces a “plant verification” requirement.  The plant verification reports should confirm that the model correctly reflects site-specific settings by presenting evidence such as delivery and testing reports, screenshots or pictures of actual hardware settings, attestations from the equipment manufacturer, etc.
	Dynamic Data for Planned Equipment
The development of future year case data may require an entity to submit the best available information for the planned equipment prior to development of a detailed design. In such cases, estimated or typical manufacturer’s dynamic data, based on units of similar design and characteristics, may be submitted. However, the Resource Entity shall update the model information upon completion of the detailed design and again upon commissioning the equipment. Dynamic data for planned equipment shall be submitted in accordance with Planning Guide Section 6.2 and Section 3.2 in this manual. 
	Unacceptable Dynamic Models 
The DWG adopted a list of unacceptable dynamic models developed by the NERC System Analysis and Modeling Subcommittee (SAMS) with exception of those models for which DWG has a technical justification not to adopt.  
	Unacceptable models that already exist in the ERCOT dynamic dataset shall be phased out through dynamic model updates including updates received via the NERC MOD-026-1 and MOD-027-1 processes.
	If a generation interconnection or dynamic model update has begun prior to a model being identified as unacceptable by NERC, the model may be allowed. 
	The list of acceptable/unacceptable dynamic models are published on the NERC website.

	Fraction of load to be interrupted.
	Corresponding frequency set points.
	Overall scheme clearing times (including all time delays, breaker clearing times, etc.)
Also, the TSP should indicate any other schemes that are part of or impact the UFLS programs such as related generation protection, islanding schemes, automatic load restoration schemes, automatic capacitor/reactor switching, and Remedial Action Scheme (RAS).  
All UFLS data will be documented in the annual Stability Book. 
	Under Voltage Load Shedding (UVLS) Relay Data
An ERCOT TSP which has UVLS relays in its service area designed to mitigate under voltage conditions potentially impacting the system reliability is to establish and maintain a UVLS Program consistent with NERC Standards.
The TSP owning an UVLS Program will submit the corresponding relay model to ERCOT during the annual Stability Book update. The DWG member shall submit the UVLS relay data in the form of a data file using an appropriate model compatible with the software listed in Section 3.1.1.
It is the responsibility of the TSP to ensure the UVLS program model submitted has been tested through an assessment as per NERC standards.
Also, the TSP shall indicate any other schemes that are part of or impact the UVLS programs such as related generation protection, islanding schemes, automatic load restoration schemes, automatic capacitor/reactor switching, and RASs.  
The model shall contain the necessary information to properly represent the under voltage relay actions in a dynamic study, including:
	Location (bus number and/or load ID) of load to be interrupted.
	Fraction of load to be interrupted.
	Corresponding voltage set points.
	Overall scheme clearing times (including all time delays, breaker clearing times, etc.).
All UVLS data from the responsible entities will be documented in the annual Stability Book.
	Protective Relay Data
The operation of protection, control, and RAS systems can affect the dynamic performance of the ERCOT system during and following contingencies. Planning, documenting, maintaining, or other activities associated with these systems is outside the scope of the DWG. However, because they can affect dynamic performance, the DWG should, on an as needed basis, identify and document protection, control, and RAS systems for inclusion to its dynamic data sets.  Identification of these protection systems will normally require the assistance of individuals or groups outside the DWG. The specific information to be considered for inclusion will depend on the type, purpose, and scope of study.
Protection, control, and RAS systems included in the DWG dynamic data should be in the form of a dynamic model and shall be compatible with the software listed in Section 3.1.1.  Protection, control, and RAS systems adequately modeled for dynamic purposes by other working groups only need to be referenced in the DWG study reports.
The DWG member, as part of the annual dynamic data update, shall review and update as necessary protection, control, and RAS systems already in the DWG database.  This review should include evaluating the existing data for applicability and accuracy.  
Protective relay data included in a DWG flat start case shall be documented in the Stability Book.
	Load Model Data 
Note: This section addresses the requirements stated in R1 of NERC Standard MOD 032-1 and R2.4.1 of NERC Standard TPL-001-4 and TPL-001-5.1 (effective July 1, 2023).
Another key component of any dynamic study is the load model and its representation as a function of changing frequency or voltage.  The load model can have a significant effect on results of dynamic analysis.  For this reason, it is important to use an appropriate load model during the study.  
The DWG shall review and update static load models for each area, composed of a mix of constant impedance (Z), constant current (I), and constant power (P) representations, known as ZIP models.  PSS/E CONL activity is used to incorporate the ZIP models into a PSS/E study.  
The DWG recommends the use of the CMLD composite load model to represent various typical dynamic load elements, and in particular, modeling of air conditioning load as needed for studies.  Due to the complexity of flat start case development, these dynamic load models are not included in the DWG flat start cases. Instead, the dynamic load models are documented in the Stability Book. 
Within 30 days of a written request from ERCOT, a TSP shall provide dynamic load models compatible with the software listed in Section 3.1.1 with documentation explaining the process to derive such models. 
The DWG shall review the standard load-frequency dependency model (LDFRAL) and update the model if necessary. The model shall be documented in the Stability Book.
	Other Types of Dynamic Data
Note: This section addresses requirements stated in R1 of NERC Standard MOD 032-1 (effective July 1, 2015). 
All elements with dynamic response capabilities (such as SVC, STATCOM, Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES), DC tie, fast switchable shunts, and Variable-Frequency Transformer) that are in service and/or modeled in the SSWG base cases shall be represented with an appropriate dynamic model compatible with the software listed in Section 3.1.1.  
The DWG member of the TSP owning the equipment shall submit the model to ERCOT during the annual dynamic database update or as needed for studies. If the equipment owner is not a TSP (e.g. DC tie owners), appropriate models shall be submitted to ERCOT and the TSP to which the equipment is connected within 30 days of any facility change and/or test result that necessitates a model update to accurately reflect dynamic performance.   
	Missing or Problematic Dynamics Data
The DWG is responsible for reviewing the dynamic data on an annual basis and reporting to the ROS any missing data or unresolved issues relating to data submission requirements.  DWG will report select data problems to the respective ERCOT working group per Section 4.2.3.  
If the DWG and/or ERCOT identifies inappropriate or incomplete dynamic data, the appropriate DWG member and/or ERCOT shall request that the equipment owner resolves the discrepancies by following processes established by existing NERC Standards or ERCOT requirements. The final responsibility for the submission and the accuracy of the data lies with the equipment owner. All of the data and the revisions requested by ERCOT shall be resolved by the entity owning the equipment within 30 days.  Until valid data becomes available, ERCOT or the DWG member to whose system the equipment is connected shall recommend an interim solution to the missing or problematic data.
	Dynamic Data and Stability Book Storage
ERCOT shall make available to the DWG members in electronic format the dynamic data described in this document.  ERCOT shall maintain a repository of dynamic data approved by the DWG and will maintain the submitted revisions.
3.5	Dynamic Models for Distributed Generation
3.5.1 Distribution Generation Resource (DGR) and Distribution Energy Storage Resource (DESR) 
RE provided models will be used to represent inverter-based DGRs and DESRs. If the RE is not required to provide a model and/or an adequate model is not available to DWG, the DER_A model will be used. Parameterization will be based on DWG approved parameters in the ERCOT DWG DG Parameterization Guideline for the DER_A model and will represent capabilities consistent with the DGR/DESR requirements in the ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide. 
RE provided models will be used to represent synchronous DGRs. If the RE is not required to provide a model and/or an adequate model is not available to DWG, a generic model with DWG approved parameters in the ERCOT DWG DG Parameterization Guideline will be used with capabilities consistent with the DGR requirements in the ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide.
3.5.2 Settlement Only Distribution Generator (SODG)
RE provided models will be used to represent inverter-based SODGs with nameplate capacity of 5 MW or greater. If the RE is not required to provide a model and/or an adequate model is not available to DWG, the DER_A model with DWG approved parameters in the ERCOT DWG DG Parameterization Guideline will be used. 
RE provided models will be used to represent synchronous SODGs with nameplate capacity of 5 MW or greater. If the RE is not required to provide a model and/or an adequate model is not available to DWG, a generic model with DWG approved parameters in the ERCOT DWG DG Parameterization Guideline will be used.
SODGs less than 5 MW will be represented as negative load (with GNET) in DWG base cases. 
3.5.3 Unregistered Distributed Generation (UDG)
UDG dynamics will not be explicitly represented in DWG base cases.  DWG will not modify UDG representation from the SSWG  case - UDG will be embedded or reflected in the load according to current TSP conventions.

 
Overview of DWG Activities 
	Updating Dynamic Data and Flat Starts
	Schedule for Dynamic Data Updates and Flat Start Cases
Note: This section addresses requirements stated in R2 of NERC Standards TPL-001-4 and TPL-001-5.1 (effective July 1, 2023).

Each June, the DWG shall prepare a detailed schedule for developing flat start cases and providing associated dynamic contingencies.  The DWG shall begin the flat start case development process as soon as practicable after SSWG base cases are posted – normally in May.  The DWG shall prepare flat start cases for near term on-peak, near term off-peak and long-term on-peak conditions to facilitate planning assessments required by NERC Standard TPL-001-4 and TPL-001-5.1 (effective July 1, 2023).  It is intended that the three dynamic data sets be developed concurrently to be utilized in planning assessments for the next year (YR+1).  The following diagram presents a schedule as a reference for DWG flat start case development:

									Stability Book Finalized and Posted

The DWG flat start case development process adds detailed dynamic models to network elements represented in an SSWG base case that reflect behavior during and following system disturbances.  The DWG shall normally prepare dynamic flat start cases based on the following SSWG steady state cases:
	Near-Term On-Peak Case: (Y+3) SUM1
	Near-Term Off-Peak Case: (Y+4) HRML
	Long-Term On-Peak Case: (Y+7) SUM1
For example, the following flat start cases would be developed during the period from July 2023 through January 2024: 2026 SUM1, 2027 HRML, and 2030 SUM1.  These cases could then be used for planning assessments performed in 2024.  The DWG may choose to develop dynamic flat start data sets for alternative cases that meet the same objectives with respect to facilitating the completion of NERC TPL planning assessments.   
After January 1st, 2015, ERCOT shall serve as the flat start coordinator for all DWG flat start cases.
	Dynamic Data Updates 
Each DWG member shall review the dynamic data from the prior year for its portion of the ERCOT System and provide necessary updates according to the schedule established in section 4.1.1. The changes in the data must be identified and submitted with the updated data.  
Data for mothballed units shall be retained. Obsolete data should be deleted or commented.
Other revisions of data that should be submitted to the flat start coordinator include updates to the load model, Zsource corrections, generation netting, or any other modifications to the network necessary for dynamic studies.
	Dynamic Data Screening 
The DWG members should review the dynamic data for equipment connected to their system for completeness and applicability.  The data should be appropriate for the model, and the model should be appropriate for the equipment.  Before submitting data for inclusion in updated dynamic base cases, each DWG member should perform dynamic data screening.  
	Flat Start Criteria
DWG Flat Start cases shall:
	Initialize with no errors;
	Demonstrate that simulation output channels for frequency, voltage and power do not deviate from an acceptable range for a Twenty-second run with no disturbance.   
	The product of a successful flat start will be a planning model software simulation-ready base case (the unconverted base case) with its associated dynamic data files including user models (.dyr, .obj, .lib, and .dll files), stability data change documentation, python (.py) files and response files (.idv) files.  The product of a successful flat start also includes the steps taken to build the flat start case such as network model changes (i.e. changing the schedule of the North DC, tuning voltages, etc.).  
	Post Flat Start Activities
	Distribution of Flat Start Results and the Dynamic Data Base
Upon completion of each flat start, all dynamic data and final data files shall be posted on the ERCOT MIS so that it is accessible to all DWG members and to ERCOT.  This posting shall be within the schedule established by the DWG for the given flat start. 
	Stability Book
The Stability Book is an annual document used to record dynamic data changes and/or corrections required during the flat start processes.  The flat start coordinator shall prepare the annual stability book.  Recommendations to revise load flow data are also included in the book.  DWG Members are required to communicate these recommendations to other respective working groups, including Steady State Working Group, Operations Working Group, and Network Data Support Working Group, to eliminate recurring problems.  
The following information is included in Stability Book: 
	Deviation tables or plots of the flat start results are included to verify the successful completion of the flat start process.
	Dynamic data.  This data is in the DOCU ALL PSS/E activity format.
	Under frequency and under voltage load shedding relay data submitted by each of the appropriate DWG members.
	Additional information identified for inclusion by Section 3.4 
	DWG Coordination with the Steady State Working Group
To support coordination with the Steady State Working Group, Operations Working Group, and Network Data Support Working Group a list of changes made to the following steady-state power flow data shall be reported to the ERCOT Steady State Working Group representative:
	Unit MVA Base: this is also known as MBASE and is used as the base quantity for many dynamic model parameters associated with generating units.
	Zsource: reactive machine impedance that is required to match the subtransient reactance specified in the dynamic generator model for proper initialization of dynamic simulations.
ERCOT shall compile the list of data changes following finalization of the flat start DWG shall coordinate with SSWG to assure that conflicting data is corrected during future SSWG case building activities. 
	DWG Dynamic Contingency Assumptions List
The DWG shall construct a dynamic contingency assumptions list detailing contingency assumptions for each TSP for the purpose of screening studies conducted by ERCOT and the DWG members. ERCOT and the DWG members shall annually review and update the dynamic contingency assumption list. Upon completion of the annual review, ERCOT shall collect the contingency assumptions and submit the finalized dynamic contingency assumptions list to the DWG.

The assumptions shall include:
	Breaker trip time for normal clearing, 
	Breaker trip time for delayed clearing due to stuck breaker
	Breaker trip time for delayed clearing due to relay failure
	Relay characteristic assumptions to assess generic apparent impedance swings that can trip any transmission system elements
	Other assumptions deemed necessary by DWG as specified during the annual review
	DWG Dynamic Contingency Database
The DWG shall prepare a Dynamic Contingency Database according to a standard spreadsheet format.  The spreadsheet format will be reviewed annually. In addition to the spreadsheet, DWG members can also provide their contingencies in python format if the spreadsheet is inadequate to accurately represent the contingencies (ex. contingencies based on detailed expansion of the station into node breaker). The dynamic contingency database and any additional contingencies provided in python will be posted on the ERCOT Market Information System (MIS) so that it is accessible to all DWG members and to ERCOT.
	Other DWG Activities 
	Event Simulation
ERCOT will compare dynamic system model performance to that of actual system response data in accordance with NERC MOD-033.  For a selected event, the affected TSP will provide actual measured system behavior data (or a written response that it does not have the requested data) to ERCOT within 30 calendar days of a written request.
	Procedure Manual Revision Guidelines
The DWG is responsible for maintaining and updating this Procedure Manual.  Revisions, additions and/or deletions to this Procedure Manual may be undertaken at such times that the DWG feels it is necessary due to changes in dynamic simulation software or to meet new and/or revised requirements of NERC, ERCOT, or any other organization having oversight or regulatory authority.
At least annually, the DWG chair shall request a thorough review of the current Procedure Manual for any needed revisions.  The notification will request that proposed revisions be submitted to the DWG chair (or the chair’s designate) for consolidation and distribution to all DWG members for comment and/or additional revision.
The DWG chair may seek approval of any revision, addition, or deletion to the Procedure Manual in the regular DWG meetings, or called special meeting as deemed necessary or requested by DWG membership.
All proposed Procedure Manual revisions shall be submitted to ROS for approval.  After ROS approval, the Procedure Manual will be publicly posted on the DWG webpage: https://www.ercot.com/committees/ros/dwg.
	Recommended DWG Study Methodologies 
Note: This section addresses, in part, requirements R4, R5 and R6 of NERC Standard TPL-001-4 and TPL-001-5.1 (effective July 1, 2023).
Voltage stability margin, transient voltage criteria, and damping criteria are described in the ERCOT Planning Guide Section 4.  
	Voltage Instability Identification in Stability Studies
Voltage Instability is indicated by severely low bus voltage or bus voltage collapse. 
Voltage Instability could cause: 
	Motor stalling leading to significant amount of customer initiated motor tripping.
	Loss of generator(s) due to low voltage 
	Voltage collapse of an area
	Cascading Identification in Stability Studies
Cascading Definition - Cascading is defined as the uncontrolled loss of any system facilities or load, whether because of thermal overload, voltage collapse, or loss of synchronism, except those occurring as a result of fault isolation. Cascading is indicated by one or more of the following conditions:
	Uncontrolled sequential loss of generators
	Uncontrolled sequential loss of load
	Uncontrolled sequential loss of branches. 
Cascading could cause conditions like:
	Voltage collapse of an area
	Expanding number of buses with voltage instability
	System islanding, frequency instability due to power-load unbalance
NERC Definition: The uncontrolled successive loss of system elements triggered by an incident at any location. Cascading results in widespread electric service interruption that cannot be restrained from sequentially spreading beyond an area predetermined by studies. 
	Uncontrolled Islanding Identification in Stability Studies
Uncontrolled islanding is the separation and loss of synchronism between a portion of the interconnection and the remaining interconnected system.  Islanding originates with uncontrolled loss of branches, ending with the formation of sub-network islands.  
Generators disconnected from the System by fault clearing action or by a RAS are not considered out of synchronism.  Similarly, islands formed from being disconnected from the System by fault clearing action or by a RAS are not considered an uncontrolled island.
Sub-network islands have the following characteristics:
	The sub-network islands have both generation and load to support the continuation of the island.  
	The sub-networks formed are not connected to each other.
Uncontrolled islanding in a screening study could cause: 
	Out-of-step generators  
	Off-nominal frequency disturbances 
	Eventual collapse of an island due to frequency or voltage instabilities caused by the generation-load unbalance in the sub-network island.
	Generator Protection Assumptions
Note: This section addresses, in part, requirements R3.3.1.1 and R4.3.1.2 of NERC Standard TPL-001-4 and TPL-001-5.1 (effective July 1, 2023).

If dynamic models are not provided for Generator protection schemes, generic generator protection may be assumed for screening purposes 
	For synchronous generators, a rotor angle swing greater than 180 degrees may be considered an unstable generator.  
	Generators may be assumed to be compliant with the minimum requirements of Section 2.9 Voltage Ride-Through Requirements for Generation Resources of the ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide.
	Generators may be assumed to be compliant with the minimum requirements of Section 2.6 Requirements for Under/Over-Frequency Relaying of the ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide.
