1	OVERVIEW
1.1	Purpose
(1)	This Planning Guide is consistent with applicable planning-related requirements of the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) Substantive Rules, Protocols and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards. 
(2)	This Planning Guide provides more detail of and establishes planning requirements for organizations and Entities operating in or potentially impacting the reliability of the ERCOT System.  These organizations and Entities shall comply with the requirements set forth in this Planning Guide. 
(3)	In the event of a conflict between the Planning Guide and Protocols, any PUCT Substantive Rules or the NERC Reliability Standards, then such PUCT Substantive Rules, NERC Reliability Standards, and the Protocols shall control. 
(4)	For application in the ERCOT Region, some NERC Reliability Standards must be adapted to fit the unique characteristics of ERCOT.  Defined terminology for NERC Regional Variances, if any, is detailed in the NERC Reliability Standards.	
1.2	Process for Planning Guide Revision
1.2.1	Introduction
(1)	A request to make additions, edits, deletions, revisions, or clarifications to this Planning Guide, including any attachments and exhibits to this Planning Guide, is called a Planning Guide Revision Request (PGRR).  Except as specifically provided in other sections of this Planning Guide, this Section 1.2, Process for Planning Guide Revision, shall be followed for all PGRRs.  ERCOT Members, Market Participants, Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) Staff, the Reliability Monitor, the Independent Market Monitor (IMM), the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Regional Entity, ERCOT, and any other Entities are required to utilize the process described herein prior to requesting, through the PUCT or other Governmental Authority, that ERCOT make a change to this Planning Guide, except for good cause shown to the PUCT or other Governmental Authority.
(2)	The “next regularly scheduled meeting” of the Reliability and Operations Subcommittee (ROS), the Wholesale Market Subcommittee (WMS), the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), the ERCOT Board or the PUCT, shall mean the next regularly scheduled meeting for which required Notice can be timely given regarding the item(s) to be addressed, as specified in the appropriate PUCT, ERCOT Board or committee procedures.
(3)	The ROS shall ensure that the Planning Guides are compliant with the ERCOT Protocols.  As such, the ROS will monitor all changes to the ERCOT Protocols and initiate any PGRRs necessary to bring the Planning Guides in conformance with the ERCOT Protocols.  The ROS will also initiate a Nodal Protocol Revision Request (NPRR) if such a change is necessary to accommodate a proposed PGRR prior to proceeding with that PGRR.
(4)	Throughout the Planning Guide, references are made to the ERCOT Protocols.  ERCOT Protocols supersede the Planning Guide and any PGRR must be compliant with the Protocols.  The ERCOT Protocols are subject to the revision process outlined in Protocol Section 21, Revision Request Process.
(5)	ERCOT may make non-substantive corrections at any time during the processing of a particular PGRR.  Under certain circumstances, however, the Planning Guide can also be revised by ERCOT rather than using the PGRR process outlined in Section 1.2.
(a)	This type of revision is referred to as an “Administrative PGRR” or “Administrative Changes” and shall consist of non-substantive corrections, such as typos (excluding grammatical changes), internal references (including table of contents), improper use of acronyms, references to ERCOT Protocols, PUCT Substantive Rules, the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA), NERC regulations, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rules, etc., and revisions for the purpose of maintaining consistency between Section 1.2 and Protocol Section 21. 
(b)	ERCOT shall post such Administrative PGRRs to the ERCOT website and distribute the PGRR to ROS.  If no Entity submits comments to the Administrative PGRR within ten Business Days in accordance with paragraph (1) of Section 1.2.3.3, ROS Review and Action, the Administrative PGRR shall be subject to PUCT approval.  Following PUCT approval, ERCOT shall implement the Administrative PGRR according to paragraph (3) of Section 1.2.5, Planning Guide Revision Implementation.  If any Entity submits comments to the Administrative PGRR, then it shall be processed in accordance with the PGRR process outlined in Section 1.2.
1.2.2	Submission of a Planning Guide Revision Request
(1)	The following Entities may submit a PGRR:
(a)	Any Market Participant;
(b)	Any ERCOT Member;
(c)	PUCT Staff;
(d)	Reliability Monitor Staff;
(e)	NERC Regional Entity Staff; 
(f) 	The IMM;
(g)	ERCOT; and 
(h)	Any other Entity that meets the following qualifications:
(i)	Resides (or represent residents) in Texas or operates in the Texas electricity market; and
(ii)	Demonstrates that Entity (or those it represents) is affected by the Customer Registration or Renewable Energy Credit (REC) Trading Program sections of the ERCOT Protocols.

1.2.3.1	Review and Posting of Planning Guide Revision Requests
(1)	PGRRs shall be submitted electronically to ERCOT by completing the designated form provided on the ERCOT website.  Excluding ERCOT-sponsored PGRRs, ERCOT shall provide an electronic return receipt response to the submitter upon receipt of the PGRR.
(2)	The PGRR shall include the following information:
(a)	Description of requested revision and reason for suggested change;
(b)	Impacts and benefits of the suggested change on ERCOT market structure, ERCOT operations, and Market Participants, to the extent that the submitter may know this information;
(c)	List of affected Planning Guide sections and subsections;
(d)	General administrative information (organization, contact name, etc.); and
(e)	Suggested language for requested revision.
(3)	ERCOT shall evaluate the PGRR for completeness and shall notify the submitter, within five Business Days of receipt, if the PGRR is incomplete, including the reasons for such status.  ERCOT may provide information to the submitter that will correct the PGRR and render it complete.  An incomplete PGRR shall not receive further consideration until it is completed.  In order to pursue the PGRR, a submitter must submit a completed version of the PGRR.
(4)	If a submitted PGRR is complete or upon completion of a PGRR, ERCOT shall post the PGRR on the ERCOT website and distribute to ROS within three Business Days.
(5)	For any ERCOT-sponsored PGRR, ERCOT shall also post an initial Impact Analysis on the ERCOT website, and distribute it to ROS.  The initial Impact Analysis will provide ROS with guidance as to potential ERCOT computer systems, operations, or business functions that could be affected by the submitted PGRR.
1.2.3.2	Withdrawal of a Planning Guide Revision Request
(1)	A submitter may withdraw or request to withdraw a PGRR by submitting a completed Request for Withdrawal form provided on the ERCOT website.  ERCOT shall post the submitter’s Request for Withdrawal on the ERCOT website within three Business Days of submittal.
(2)	The submitter of a PGRR may withdraw the PGRR at any time before ROS recommends approval of the PGRR.  
(3)	If ROS has recommended approval of the PGRR, the Request for Withdrawal must be approved by the TAC if the PGRR has not yet been recommended for approval by TAC.
(4)	If TAC has recommended approval of the PGRR, the Request for Withdrawal must be approved by the ERCOT Board if the PGRR has not yet been recommended for approval by the ERCOT Board.
(5)	Once recommended for approval by the ERCOT Board, a PGRR cannot be withdrawn.
1.2.3.3	ROS Review and Action
(1)	Any ERCOT Member, Market Participant, PUCT Staff, Reliability Monitor Staff, NERC Regional Entity Staff, the IMM Staff, or ERCOT may comment on the PGRR.

3	REGIONAL PLANNING
3.1	Communications
3.1.1	Overview of Major Transmission Planning Activities
(1)	The process of planning a reliable and efficient transmission system for the ERCOT Region is composed of several types of activities and studies.  
(2)	The effective date for the Year 6 case is the 2014 Steady State Working Group (SSWG) Data Set B base case release date.  Consideration of the Year 6 case in the Regional Transmission Plan is required starting in 2014.
3.1.1.1	Long-Term System Assessment
(1)	The Long-Term System Assessment (LTSA) is performed by ERCOT in coordination with the Regional Planning Group (RPG) on a biennial basis (in even-numbered years) and reviewed annually.  The study uses scenario analysis techniques to assess the potential needs of the ERCOT System up to 20 years into the future.  The role of the LTSA is not to recommend the construction of specific system upgrades, due to the high degree of uncertainty associated with the amount and location of loads and Resources in this timeframe.  Instead, the role of the LTSA is to evaluate the system upgrades that are indicated under each of a wide variety of scenarios in order to identify upgrades that are robust across a range of scenarios or might be more economic than the upgrades that would be determined considering only needs of Years 1 to 6 in the Regional Transmission Plan development.
[PGRR116:  Insert paragraph (2) below upon system implementation of NPRR1240:]
(2)	ERCOT shall post the LTSA as follows:
(a)	Versions that include ERCOT Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (ECEII) shall be posted on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area;
(b)	Versions that include both ECEII and Protected Information shall be posted on the MIS Certified Area for Transmission Service Providers (TSPs) only; and
(c)	Versions redacted of ECEII and Protected Information shall be posted on the ERCOT website.

3.1.1.2	Regional Transmission Plan
(1)	The Regional Transmission Plan is developed annually by ERCOT, in coordination with the RPG and Transmission Service Providers (TSPs).  The Regional Transmission Plan addresses regional and ERCOT-wide reliability and economic transmission needs and the planned improvements to meet those needs for the upcoming six years starting with the SSWG base cases.  These planned improvements include projects previously approved by the ERCOT Board, projects previously reviewed by the RPG, new projects that will be refined at the appropriate time by TSPs in order to complete RPG review, and the local projects currently planned by TSPs.  Combined, these projects represent ERCOT’s plan which addresses the reliability and efficiency of the ERCOT System in order to meet North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards, the Protocols, Nodal Operating Guides and this Planning Guide.  Projects that are included in the Regional Transmission Plan are not considered to have been endorsed by ERCOT until they have undergone the appropriate level of RPG Project Review as outlined in Protocol Section 3.11.4, Regional Planning Group Project Review Process, if required.  The process used by ERCOT to develop the Regional Transmission Plan is outlined in Section 3.1.4, Regional Transmission Plan Development Process.
(2)	ERCOT shall post the Regional Transmission Plan by December 31 of each year as follows:
(a)	Versions that include ERCOT Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (ECEII) shall be posted on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area;
(b)	Versions that include both ECEII and Protected Information shall be posted on the MIS Certified Area for TSPs only; and
(c)	Versions redacted of ECEII and Protected Information shall be posted on the ERCOT website.
(3)	ERCOT shall include in the Regional Transmission Plan report a list of Transmission Facilities that are loaded above 95% of their applicable Ratings for the following conditions:
(a)	Normal system conditions; or 
(b)	Following the contingency loss of a single generating unit, transmission circuit, transformer, or common tower outage.
3.1.1.3	Regional Planning Group Project Reviews
(1)	Except for minor transmission projects that have only localized impacts and projects that are directly associated with the interconnection of new Generation Resources, all transmission projects in the ERCOT Region undergo a formal review by the RPG in accordance with Protocol Section 3.11.4, Regional Planning Group Project Review Process.  In addition, ERCOT performs an independent analysis of the need for major transmission projects that are submitted for RPG Project Review.  The affirmative result of this review is formal endorsement of the project by ERCOT.  This ERCOT project endorsement is intended to support, to the extent applicable, a finding by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) that a project is necessary for the service, accommodation, convenience, or safety of the public within the meaning of Public Utility Regulatory Act, TEX. UTIL. CODE ANN. § 37.056 (Vernon 1998 and Supp. 2007) and P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.101, Certification Criteria.
[PGRR118:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation of NPRR1246:]

UTIL. CODE ANN. § 37.056 (Vernon 1998 and Supp. 2007) and P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.101, Certification Criteria.
3.1.1.4	Generation Interconnection Process
(1)	This process facilitates the interconnection of new generation units in the ERCOT Region by assessing the transmission upgrades necessary for new generating units to operate reliably.  The process to study interconnecting new generation or modifying an existing generation interconnection to the ERCOT Transmission Grid is covered in Section 5, Generator Interconnection or Modification.  The generation interconnection study process primarily covers the direct connection of generation Facilities to the ERCOT Transmission Grid and directly-related projects.  Additional upgrades to the ERCOT Transmission Grid that might be cost-effective as a result of new or modified generation may be initiated by any stakeholder through the RPG Project Review procedure described in Protocol Section 3.11.4, Regional Planning Group Project Review Process, at the appropriate time, subject to the confidentiality provisions in Section 5.    
3.1.1.5	Geomagnetic Disturbance (GMD) Vulnerability Assessment
(1)	The purpose of Geomagnetic Disturbance (GMD) vulnerability assessments is to provide a coordinated assessment and corrective action plan(s) for the ERCOT System to meet ERCOT and NERC GMD reliability performance criteria for GMD events.  The most recent Geomagnetically-Induced Current (GIC) system models developed and maintained by ERCOT in collaboration with the TSPs and Resource Entities as described in Section 6.11, Process for Developing Geomagnetically-Induced Current (GIC) System Models, shall be used as the basis for the ERCOT benchmark and supplemental GMD vulnerability assessments.  Projects that are included in the corrective action plan(s) are not considered to have been endorsed by ERCOT until they have undergone the appropriate level of RPG Project Review as outlined in Protocol Section 3.11.4, Regional Planning Group Project Review Process, if required.  The process used by ERCOT to develop the GMD benchmark and supplemental vulnerability assessments is outlined in Section 3.1.8, Planning Geomagnetic Disturbance (GMD) Activities.
3.1.1.6	Grid Reliability and Resiliency Assessment (GRRA) 
(1)	ERCOT shall perform the Grid Reliability and Resiliency Assessment (GRRA) in coordination with the RPG on a biennial basis in even-numbered years to assess the reliability and resiliency of the ERCOT System in extreme weather scenarios.  The study shall:
(a)	Consider the impact of different levels of thermal and renewable generation availability;
(b)	Identify areas of the ERCOT Region that face significant grid reliability and resiliency issues, taking into account the impact of potential Outages caused by regional extreme weather scenarios on Customers; and
(c)	Identify transmission upgrades that are expected to increase the reliability or resiliency of the ERCOT System in extreme weather scenarios based on the criteria established in Section 4.1.2, Resiliency Criteria.
(2)	Extreme weather scenarios shall be selected for one or more study cases.  The study cases prepared will be adjusted to have sufficient power supply to meet the demand.  The study cases shall be based on the current Regional Transmission Plan study cases, utilizing coincident load values, and may include scenarios that vary one or more of the following modeling assumptions:
(a)	Different patterns of generation; 
(b)	Extreme peak load; 
(c)	Multiple Transmission Element Outages; and/or
(d)	Multiple Generation Resource Outages.
(3)	Under the extreme weather study scenarios described in paragraph (2) above, the post-contingency performance of the ERCOT System shall be evaluated for the following contingency events:
(a)	Categories P0, P1, and P2.1 as defined in NERC Reliability Standard TPL-001, System Performance Under Normal Conditions; and 
(b)	Common tower outages as defined in Section 4.1.1.1, Planning Assumptions.
3.1.2	Regional Planning Group Project Submission
(1)	Transmission projects that are proposed for RPG Review, pursuant to Protocol Section 3.11.4.1, Project Submission, shall be submitted according to the provisions outlined in Section 3.1.2.1, All Projects.  
3.1.2.1	All Projects
(1)	The submittal of each transmission project (60 kV and above) for RPG Project Review should include the following elements:
(a)	The proposed project description including expected cost, feasible alternative(s) considered, transmission topology and Transmission Facility modeling parameter data, and all study cases used to generate results supporting the need for the project in electronic format (powerflow data should be in PTI Power System Simulator for Engineering (PSS/E) RAWD format).  Also, the submission should include accurate maps and one-line diagrams showing locations of the proposed project and feasible alternatives;
(b)	Identification of the SSWG, Dynamics Working Group (DWG), or Regional Transmission Plan powerflow cases used as a basis for the study and any associated changes that describe and allow accurate modeling of the proposed project;
(c)	Description and data for all changes made to the SSWG base cases or Regional Transmission Plan cases used to identify the need for the project, such as Generation Resource unavailability and area peak load forecast;  
[PGRR118:  Replace paragraph (c) above with the following upon system implementation of NPRR1246:]
(c)	Description and data for all changes made to the SSWG base cases or Regional Transmission Plan cases used to identify the need for the project, such as Resource unavailability and area peak load forecast;  
(d)	A description of the reliability and/or economic problem that is being solved; 
(e)	Information that supports any load values that differ from the load forecast used in the base cases identified in item (b) above, including any relevant historical load information or evidence demonstrating that a submitted load value is Substantiated Load;
(f)	A description of the Subsynchronous Resonance (SSR) impact of the proposed project to the generation Facilities in the system pursuant to Protocol Section 3.22.1, Subsynchronous Resonance Vulnerability Assessment, and potential SSR Countermeasure plan for any identified SSR vulnerability, if applicable; 
(g)	Desired/needed in-service date for the project, and feasible in-service date, if different; 
(h)	The phone number and email address of the single point of contact who can respond to ERCOT and RPG participant questions or requests for additional information necessary for stakeholder review; and
(i)	Analysis of rejected alternatives, including cost estimates, and other factors considered in the comparison of alternatives with the proposed project.
(2)	Both transmission and distribution solutions to performance deficiencies may be considered where applicable.  
(3)	If there is any other information, not included above, that the submitting party believes is relevant to consideration of the need for any submitted project, the submitting party should include that information in the project submission.     
3.1.3	Project Evaluation
(1)	ERCOT and the RPG shall evaluate proposed transmission projects using a variety of tools and techniques as needed to ensure that the system is able to meet applicable reliability criteria in a cost-effective manner.  For most proposed projects, several alternatives will be identified to meet the reliability criteria or other performance improvement objectives that the proposed project is designed to meet.  The project alternative with the expected lowest cost over the life of the project is generally recommended, subject to consideration of the expected long-term system needs in the area, including, as applicable, any evidence of Substantiated Load, and subject to consideration of the relative operational impacts of the alternatives.  
(2)	In some cases, one alternative may be to dispatch the system in such a way that all reliability requirements are met, even without the proposed transmission project or any transmission alternative, resulting in a less efficient dispatch than what would be required to meet the reliability requirements if the proposed project was in place.  Consideration of the merits of this alternative relative to the proposed transmission project is more complex.  To facilitate the discussion and consideration of these alternatives, ERCOT has adopted certain definitions and practices, described in paragraph (4) of Protocol Section 3.11.2, Planning Criteria, and Sections 3.1.3.1, Definitions of Reliability-Driven and Economic-Driven Projects, and 3.1.3.2, Reliability-Driven Project Evaluation below.
(3)	In conducting an independent review of any project, ERCOT may, in its discretion, make adjustments to the planning case to ensure that the case reaches a solution.  When conducting an independent review of any project classified as Tier 1 pursuant to Protocol Section 3.11.4, Regional Planning Group Project Review Process, ERCOT must provide reasonable advance notice to the RPG of any proposed adjustments and an opportunity for stakeholder comment on them.  
(4)	As part of its independent review of any project classified as Tier 1 pursuant to Protocol Section 3.11.4, ERCOT shall: 
(a)	Perform a generation sensitivity analysis.  The generation sensitivity analysis will evaluate the effect that proposed Generation Resources in or near the study area will have on a recommended transmission project.  Generation Resources that have signed Standard Generation Interconnection Agreements (SGIAs) but were not included in the study cases because they did not meet all of the requirements for inclusion in the cases pursuant to Section 6.9, Addition of Proposed Generation to the Planning Models, will be included in the sensitivity analysis.  ERCOT shall not consider the results of the generation sensitivity analysis in determining project need during its independent review of the project; and
[PGRR118:  Replace paragraph (a) above with the following upon system implementation of NPRR1246:]
(a)	Perform a generation sensitivity analysis.  The generation sensitivity analysis will evaluate the effect that proposed Generation Resources and/or ESRs in or near the study area will have on a recommended transmission project.  Generation Resources and ESRs that have signed Standard Generation Interconnection Agreements (SGIAs) but were not included in the study cases because they did not meet all of the requirements for inclusion in the cases pursuant to Section 6.9, Addition of Proposed Generation to the Planning Models, will be included in the sensitivity analysis.  ERCOT shall not consider the results of the generation sensitivity analysis in determining project need during its independent review of the project; and  
(b)	Evaluate impacts related to the load scaling used in the study on any constraints resulting in project recommendations.  The results of this evaluation shall be included in the final recommendations in the independent review.
(5)	ERCOT’s independent review shall incorporate and consider historical load and any Substantiated Load.
3.1.3.1	Definitions of Reliability-Driven and Economic-Driven Projects
(1)	Proposed transmission projects are categorized for evaluation purposes into two types:
(a)	Reliability-driven projects; and 
(b)	Economic-driven projects.
(2)	The differentiation between these two types of projects is based on whether a simultaneously-feasible, security-constrained generating unit commitment dispatch is expected to be available for all hours of the planning horizon that can resolve the system reliability issue that the proposed project is intended to resolve.  If it is not possible to simulate a dispatch of the Generation Resources such that all reliability criteria are met without the project, and the addition of the project allows the reliability criteria to be met, then the project is classified as a reliability-driven project.  If it is possible to simulate a dispatch of the Generation Resources in such a way that all reliability criteria are met without the project, but the project may allow the reliability criteria to be met at a lower total cost, then the project is classified as an economic-driven project.  When performing a simulation of the generating unit commitment and dispatch, only contingencies and limits that would be considered in the operations horizon shall be simulated.  
[PGRR118:  Replace paragraph (2) above with the following upon system implementation of NPRR1246:]

When performing a simulation of the generating unit commitment and dispatch, only contingencies and limits that would be considered in the operations horizon shall be simulated. 
3.1.3.2	Reliability-Driven Project Evaluation
(1)	For reliability-driven projects, the comparison of project costs generally includes only the relative capital costs of the alternatives.  In the case of Tier 1 and 2 projects, any differences in expected ERCOT System production costs between the alternatives may be included in the consideration of the relative costs of the alternatives, due to larger potential impacts on losses and congestion of these projects.
3.1.4	Regional Transmission Plan Development Process
(1)	As prescribed by Section 3.1.1.2, Regional Transmission Plan, the purpose of the Regional Transmission Plan is to provide a coordinated plan for the ERCOT System.  This Section describes the process used by ERCOT to develop the Regional Transmission Plan.  While unanticipated changes in Load and generation may require additional projects to be needed that were not included in the current Regional Transmission Plan, or require additional evaluation of projects included in the current Regional Transmission Plan when they are submitted for RPG Project Review, the Regional Transmission Plan provides a reasonable and supportable basis for analyses of the planned ERCOT Transmission Grid.   
3.1.4.1	Development of Regional Transmission Plan
(1)	The planning process begins with computer modeling studies of the generation and Transmission Facilities and substation Loads under normal conditions in the ERCOT System.  Contingency conditions along with changes in Load and generation that might be expected to occur in operation of the ERCOT Transmission Grid are also modeled.  To maintain adequate service and minimize interruptions during Outages, model simulations are used to identify adverse results based upon the planning criteria and to examine the effectiveness of various problem-solving alternatives.
(2)	The effectiveness of each alternative will be evaluated under a variety of possible operating environments because Loads and operating conditions cannot be predicted with certainty.  As a result, repeated simulations under different conditions are often required.  In addition, options considered for future installation may affect other alternatives so that several different combinations must be evaluated, thereby multiplying the number of simulations required.
(3)	Once feasible alternatives have been identified, the process is continued with a comparison of those alternatives.  To determine the most favorable, the short-range and long-range benefits of each alternative must be considered including operating flexibility and compatibility with future plans.
3.1.4.1.1	Regional Transmission Plan Cases
(1)	The starting base cases for the Regional Transmission Plan development are created by removing all Tier 1, 2, and 3 projects that have not received RPG acceptance or, if applicable, ERCOT endorsement from the most recent SSWG base cases.

(2)	ERCOT shall set all non-seasonal Mothballed Generation Resources to out of service in the Regional Transmission Plan reliability base cases.  ERCOT shall add proposed Generation Resources that have met the criteria for inclusion in Section 6.9, Addition of Proposed Generation to the Planning Models, to the Regional Transmission Plan base cases.
[PGRR118:  Replace paragraph (2) above with the following upon system implementation of NPRR1246:]
(2)	ERCOT shall set all non-seasonal Mothballed Generation Resources and Mothballed ESRs to out of service in the Regional Transmission Plan reliability base cases.  ERCOT shall add proposed Generation Resources and ESRs that have met the criteria for inclusion in Section 6.9, Addition of Proposed Generation to the Planning Models, to the Regional Transmission Plan base cases. 
(3)	ERCOT shall update the Regional Transmission Plan reliability and economic base cases to reflect any updates to the amount of Switchable Generation Resource (SWGR) capacity available to the ERCOT Region. 
(4)	ERCOT may, in its discretion, set a Generation Resource to out of service in the Regional Transmission Plan base cases prior to receiving a Notification of Suspension of Operations (NSO) if the Resource Entity notifies ERCOT of its intent to retire/mothball the Generation Resource and/or makes a public statement of its intent to retire/mothball the Generation Resource.  ERCOT must provide reasonable advance notice to the RPG of any proposed Generation Resource retirements/mothballs and allow an opportunity for stakeholder comments.
(a)	ERCOT will post and maintain the current list of Generation Resources that will be set to out of service pursuant to paragraph (4) above on the ERCOT website.
[PGRR118:  Replace paragraph (4) above with the following upon system implementation of NPRR1246:]
(4)	ERCOT may, in its discretion, set a Generation Resource or ESR to out of service in the Regional Transmission Plan base cases prior to receiving a Notification of Suspension of Operations (NSO) if the Resource Entity notifies ERCOT of its intent to retire/mothball the Resource and/or makes a public statement of its intent to retire/mothball the Resource.  ERCOT must provide reasonable advance notice to the RPG of any proposed Resource retirements/mothballs and allow an opportunity for stakeholder comments.
(a)	ERCOT will post and maintain the current list of Generation Resources and ESRs that will be set to out of service pursuant to paragraph (4) above on the ERCOT website. 
(5)	In its Regional Transmission Plan studies, ERCOT shall first consider transmission needs without Remedial Action Scheme (RAS) actions.  After evaluating these needs, ERCOT may model a RAS in the Regional Transmission Plan cases only if ERCOT’s initial studies did not identify a transmission project to exit the RAS or if a transmission project to exit the RAS is not expected to be in service by the season and year the case represents.
[PGRR113:  Replace paragraph (5) above with the following upon system implementation of NPRR1198:]
(5)	In its Regional Transmission Plan studies, ERCOT shall first consider transmission needs without Remedial Action Scheme (RAS) or Constraint Management Plan (CMP) actions.  After evaluating these needs, ERCOT may model a RAS or CMP in the Regional Transmission Plan cases only if ERCOT’s initial studies did not identify a transmission project to exit the RAS or CMP, or if a transmission project to exit the RAS or CMP is not expected to be in service by the season and year the case represents.
(6)	ERCOT may, in its discretion, make other adjustments to any Regional Transmission Plan base case to ensure that the case reaches a solution.  ERCOT must provide reasonable advance notice to the RPG of any proposed adjustments and an opportunity for stakeholder comment on them.   
3.1.4.2	Use of Regional Transmission Plan
(1)	If a project submitted for RPG review is included in the Regional Transmission Plan, and no changes are identified which would affect the need for the proposed project through the comment period described in Section 3.1.5, Regional Planning Group Comment Process, then the Regional Transmission Plan may serve as the ERCOT Independent Review of the proposed project.
(2)	Tier 1, 2, and 3 projects that are included in the Regional Transmission Plan should be submitted for RPG Project Review at an appropriate lead time.  Generally, this lead time should be sufficient to allow the review to be completed before the TSP reaches the decision point at which it must initiate the engineering and procurement in order to meet the required in-service date, but not farther in advance than is necessary.  In general, these lead times will be three to four months for Tier 3 projects and six to seven months for Tier 1 and 2 projects.  
(3)	Tier 1, 2, and 3 projects that are included in the Regional Transmission Plan but do not reach this decision point before the development of the next year’s Regional Transmission Plan begins will be removed from the case used to develop the Regional Transmission Plan and will be re-evaluated as a part of the development of this subsequent Regional Transmission Plan.     
3.1.5	Regional Planning Group Comment Process
(1)	Any stakeholder may initiate an RPG project review in accordance with Protocol Section 3.11.4.1, Project Submission.  All project submissions should be sent electronically to rpg_submittal@ercot.com.  The RPG project review consists of the following steps:  
(a)	ERCOT will provide electronic copies of RPG project review submittals by email to the RPG within five Business Days of receipt and solicit comments or questions from the RPG;
(b)	ERCOT will assign a unique project identification number (RPG project number) to the RPG project review submittals according to the following convention:
yrRPGxxx
            where:	       yr is the calendar year the RPG project is submitted
	             RPG indicates RPG project
	                   xxx is a sequence number beginning with 001 (reset for each year)
(c)	All concerns/questions or objections about the submitted project by any stakeholder or ERCOT should be submitted by email to the RPG within 15 Business Days after ERCOT’s transmittal to the RPG;
(d)	Each Entity providing comments should provide a “single” complete comment about each project by the end of the 15-Business Day comment period rather than sending multiple comments at various times or from various individuals;
(e)	Any questions related to data deficiency should be submitted to ERCOT and the submitting party immediately;
(f)	If concerns or objections about a project are received during the 15-Business Day comment period, the project will be put into “study mode.”  During study mode, the submitting party shall respond to any concerns or objections and provide additional information, if necessary, by email to the RPG until all concerns are resolved or until ERCOT assesses that a reasonable effort has been made to resolve all concerns or objections.  A submitting party may make modifications to a Tier 3 project to address concerns or objections without having to resubmit the project so long as the modifications do not result in the project being classified as a Tier 1 or 2 project.  Study mode shall end no later than 20 Business Days following the end of the comment period, unless ERCOT finds good cause to extend study mode;
(g)	The submitting party should answer all questions and respond to all concerns in a timely manner;
(h)	Comments should be based on Good Utility Practice and sound engineering judgment.  Suggestions should be able to be implemented by the TSP constructing and operating the project; and
(i)	ERCOT will post all project submissions, the comments received, and other information and databases associated with submitted transmission projects on the MIS Secure Area.
(j)	Comments received after the 15-Business Day comment period may be considered by ERCOT or the submitting party, but a response is not required.
3.1.6	Notify PUCT of Recommended Transmission Projects
(1)	ERCOT will notify the PUCT of the disposition of all Tier 1 or 2 projects and of the designated TSPs for those projects.

4	TRANSMISSION PLANNING CRITERIA
4.1	Introduction
(1)	ERCOT employs reliability, economic, and resiliency criteria in evaluating the need for transmission system improvements.  The economic criteria are included in Protocol Section 3.11.2, Planning Criteria.  This Planning Guide provides the reliability and resiliency criteria.
(2)	The ERCOT System consists of those generation and Transmission Facilities (60 kV and higher voltages) that are controlled by individual Market Participants and that function as part of an integrated and coordinated system.
(3)	To maintain reliable operation of the ERCOT System, it is necessary that all stakeholders observe and subscribe to certain minimum planning criteria.  The criteria set forth in this Section 4.1 constitute the aforementioned minimum planning criteria.  Tests outlined herein shall be performed to determine conformance to these minimum criteria; however, ERCOT recognizes that events more severe than those outlined in these criteria could cause grid separation and other tests may also be performed.
(4)	The complexity and uncertainty inherent in the planning and operation of the ERCOT System make exhaustive studies impracticable; therefore, to gain maximum benefit from the limited number of tests performed, the selection of the specific tests and the frequency of their performance will be made solely upon the basis of the expected value of the reliability information obtainable from the test.
(5)	ERCOT shall perform steady-state, short circuit, and dynamic analyses appropriate to ensure the reliability of the ERCOT System and identify appropriate solutions.
(6)	Each Transmission Service Provider (TSP) will perform steady-state, short circuit, and dynamic analyses appropriate to ensure the reliability of its portion of the ERCOT System and implement appropriate solutions to meet the reliability performance criteria in this Section 4.1.
(7)	The base cases created by the Steady-State Working Group (SSWG) and System Protection Working Group (SPWG) are available for use by Market Participants.  
(8)	If a TSP has its own planning criteria in addition to those defined in this Planning Guide, the TSP shall provide documentation of those criteria to ERCOT.  ERCOT shall post the documentation on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area.  The TSP shall notify ERCOT of any changes to their planning criteria and provide revised documentation within 30 days of such change.
[PGRR116:  Replace paragraph (8) above with the following upon system implementation of NPRR1240:]
(8)	If a TSP has its own planning criteria in addition to those defined in this Planning Guide, the TSP shall provide documentation of those criteria to ERCOT.

(ii)	Changing the inverter, turbine, generator, battery modules, or power converter associated with a facility with an aggregate real power rating of ten MW or greater, unless the replacement is in-kind;
(iii)	Modifying any control settings or equipment of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) that impact the dynamic response (such as voltage, frequency, and current injections) at the Point of Interconnection (POI) in a manner that is deemed to require further study in accordance with the process outlined in paragraph (5) of Section 5.5, Generator Commissioning and Continuing Operations;  
(iv)	Changing or adding a POI to a facility with an aggregate real power rating of ten MW or greater; or
(v)	Increasing the aggregate nameplate capacity of a generator less than ten MW to ten MW or greater.
(2)	For the purposes of Section 5, the term “generator” includes but is not limited to a Generation Resource, SOG, and ESR.
(3)	For the purposes of determining the appropriate requirements in Section 5, a generator is considered a “large generator” if it currently has or is proposed to have an aggregate nameplate capacity of ten MW or greater.  A generator is considered a “small generator” if it currently has or is proposed to have an aggregate nameplate capacity of less than ten MW.
(4)	Notwithstanding paragraph (3), above, if a Resource Entity is proposing to increase the real power rating of an existing generator by one MW or greater but less than ten MW, that generator shall be considered a small generator for the purposes of the interconnection process described in Section 5.
(5)	Notwithstanding paragraphs (3) and (4), above, if a Resource Entity is proposing to increase a generator’s real power rating by ten MW or more, or is proposing to increase a generator’s real power rating from less than ten MW to ten MW or more, that generator shall be considered a large generator for the purposes of the interconnection process described in Section 5.
(6)	For the purposes of determining the appropriate requirements in Section 5, ERCOT may require two or more separate generator interconnection requests to the same substation to follow the interconnection process applicable to the large generators, if, following the proposed change, those generators would have an aggregate nameplate capacity of ten MW or greater, and the projects are proposed by the same Entity or Affiliates.
(7)	For a new or modified generator that has been designated as a Self-Limiting Facility or as a component of a Self-Limiting Facility, the categorization of the generator as a small generator or large generator pursuant to paragraphs (3) through (5) above shall be determined using the Self-Limiting Facility’s established limit on the total MW Injection, or if applicable, the proposed increase in that value instead of the nameplate capacity of the Self-Limiting Facility.
5.2.2	Initiation of Generator Interconnection or Modification

(3)	An Entity is not eligible to initiate or maintain a GIM if the real property to be utilized by or for the project is owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by an Entity that meets any of the prohibited company ownership (including affiliations) or headquarters criteria identified in the Lone Star Infrastructure Protection Act, Texas Business and Commerce Code, Sections 113.002(a)(2)(A)-(b)(2)(B) or 2274.0102(a)(2)(A)-(b)(2)(B), added by Act of June 18, 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., Ch. 975 (S.B. 2116).  The Interconnecting Entity (IE) must provide an attestation Section 8, Attachment D, confirming that such prohibited ownership or control does not apply to the real property.
(4)	For the purposes of submitting a GIM:
(a)	MW values should be determined at the generator terminals;  
(b)	If generation is serving new or existing Load then this must be identified in the RIOO request; and
(c)	The latitude, longitude, and county are those of the station that includes the main power transformer for the subject facility.
(d)	Failure to supply any required data may delay ERCOT processing of the interconnection application and studies and result in project cancellation.  
(5)	Payment of the Generation Interconnection Fee and all other related fees payable to ERCOT must be made using an Automated Clearing House (ACH) e-check or credit card via the RIOO system.  This fee is non-refundable and must be paid even if ERCOT waives the Security Screening Study described in Section 5.3.1, Security Screening Study, or cancels the project due to failure to submit complete project information.  The fee must be paid for each additional interconnection request (INR) even if a fee has previously been paid for another INR associated with the same generator.
(6)	Upon receiving the application, ERCOT will assign the project a unique identification number (INR number) according to the following convention: 
	yrINRxxxx
	where:  yr is the year the generation is anticipated to be commissioned
	INR indicates it is an interconnection request
	xxxx is a sequence number beginning with 0001 (reset for each year) 

(7)	The proposed Commercial Operations Date for large generators meeting paragraph (1)(a) of Section 5.2.1 must be at least 15 months after the date the application is submitted or it will not be accepted.  If conditions allow, the Commercial Operations Date can be changed after submission. 
(8)	ERCOT will notify the IE within ten days if the GIM application fails to include the applicable fees or the information that is necessary for the GIM application to be approved. 
(9)	If the IE fails to respond to ERCOT’s inquiries within ten Business Days, the GIM application will be deemed incomplete and returned to the IE using the online RIOO system.  The IE will be notified that action is required via a RIOO system automated email.
(10)	Once the application has been deemed materially complete, ERCOT will notify the IE of receipt of the completed application within ten Business Days.
(11)	An ERCOT-designated point of contact will be assigned to oversee the interconnection study process and answer questions concerning the interconnection process.  Once assigned, the ERCOT-designated point of contact will contact the IE and will be the primary ERCOT contact for the IE.
(12)	Prior to the initial contact from the ERCOT-designated point of contact, an IE may direct questions concerning the GIM process to ResourceIntegrationDepartment@ercot.com.  All GIM-related email communication sent to the ERCOT-designated point of contact or to ResourceIntegrationDepartment@ercot.com shall include the associated project INR number in the subject field.  If the communication is not specific to a project, the email subject field shall have the words “Generator Interconnection or Modification.” 
(13)	If a proposed generator that would use the same physical interconnection is to be built in phases with in-service dates more than three months apart, each phase should be treated as a separate interconnection request but may be included in the same study.
5.2.3	Confidentiality
(1)	For any interconnection request involving a large generator, all data, documents or other information regarding the interconnection request, including the identity of the IE, will remain Protected Information until ERCOT receives written Notice from the IE that this information may be made public or until the IE requests a Full Interconnection Study (FIS).  The FIS agreement may contain confidential cost estimates; it will remain Protected Information and will not be released to parties other than those who are members of the confidential Transmission Owner Generation Interconnection list except as otherwise required by a court or by regulatory authorities having jurisdiction.  
(2)	For any interconnection request involving a small generator, all data, documents, or other information regarding the interconnection request, including the identity of the IE, will remain Protected Information until ERCOT receives written Notice from the IE that this information may be made public or until ERCOT approves the IE’s completed Resource Registration form for inclusion in the Network Operations Model, whichever occurs first.
(3)	Once the interconnection request is classified as a public project through one of these steps, ERCOT will make available the project description, the results of any economic analysis of Transmission Facilities needed to connect the generator costing over $25,000,000, and any information developed throughout the interconnection study process about transmission improvement projects that may be submitted for Regional Planning Group (RPG) review as a result of the new generation.
5.2.4	Duty to Update Project Information and Respond to ERCOT and TDSP Requests for Information
(1)	Each IE shall provide current and accurate Resource Registration information (including information describing the generator, the MPT, and any other generator-owned transmission or distribution facilities) and contact information to ERCOT and the interconnecting Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP), and shall promptly update that information as soon as possible, but no later than ten Business Days, following any change to that information.  All TDSPs will be sent notification when ERCOT reviews and acknowledges Registration information changes in the online RIOO system.  Interconnection studies that are based on outdated, false, or inaccurate data may adversely affect the safety and reliability of the ERCOT System and can result in damage to generation or transmission equipment.  Failure to provide accurate Resource Registration information and contact information may result in project delays or cancellation as described in Section 5.2.6, Project Cancellation Due to Failure to Comply with Requirements.  
(2)	Twice each year, each IE that has submitted an FIS request shall submit via the online RIOO system, for each proposed facility, the declaration in Section 8, Attachment A, Declaration of Resource Data Accuracy, stating that, as of the date of submission, the most recently submitted data on the current version of the Resource Registration form accurately reflects the anticipated characteristics of the proposed Resource and that the contact information is correct.  The declaration shall be executed by an officer or other person having authority to bind the company and shall be submitted via the online RIOO system.  Each IE shall submit one declaration for each project no earlier than March 1 and no later than March 15 each year, and shall submit another declaration for each proposed facility no earlier than September 1 and no later than September 15 each year.  Failure to submit a declaration may result in project cancellation as described in Section 5.2.6.  
(3)	If, after receipt of updated Resource Registration data, ERCOT, the interconnecting TDSP, or the lead Transmission Service Provider (TSP) determines that any subsequent changes to the project or to the transmission system or distribution system may affect the reliable operation of the ERCOT System or otherwise warrant new studies, then ERCOT or the TDSP may require additional studies to be performed before the proposed generator is allowed to interconnect to the ERCOT System.  The IE and TDSP(s) shall develop a schedule for completing the additional studies.  The TDSP shall provide the FIS studies, if applicable, to ERCOT and the other TDSPs via the online RIOO system.  
(4)	If the IE increases the requested amount of capacity of any proposed large generator by more than 20% of the amount requested in the initial application, the IE shall submit a new interconnection request for the additional capacity or for the entire project.  
(5)	Within ten Business Days, the IE shall notify ERCOT and the interconnecting TDSP, or, if applicable, lead TSP of any change in ownership and shall provide conclusive documentary evidence of the ownership change (such as a purchase/sale agreement or a document executed by both parties confirming the transaction) via the online RIOO system.  TDSPs will receive notification when ERCOT reviews and acknowledges the change.  The new owner shall acknowledge the sale by submitting the Resource Registrations data showing the contact information for the new owners within 60 days.  Failure to do so may result in project cancellation as described in Section 5.2.6.
(6)	An IE shall not transfer all or any portion of a project, including the real property to be utilized by the project, to an Entity that meets any of the prohibited company ownership (including affiliations) or headquarters criteria identified in the Lone Star Infrastructure Protection Act, Texas Business and Commerce Code, Sections 113.002(a)(2)(A)-(b)(2)(B) or 2274.0102(a)(2)(A)-(b)(2)(B), added by Act of June 18, 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., Ch. 975 (S.B. 2116).  If the IE for a project changes, then the new IE shall execute and submit a new attestation in RIOO within ten Business Days of the change in ownership.  If the IE for a project relocates the IE’s headquarters, then the IE shall execute and submit a new attestation in RIOO within ten Business Days of the change in headquarters.  If an IE or the real property that will be utilized by or for the project meets any of the prohibited company ownership or affiliation criteria, the project will be subject to cancellation in the manner described in Section 5.2.6.  
(7)	To support ERCOT resource adequacy and North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) reliability assessment reporting requirements, the IE shall provide the following information via the online RIOO system as soon as possible, but in no event later than ten Business Days after the information is available or has been updated:
(a)	Revisions to the initial projected Commercial Operations Date and if available, the energization and Initial Synchronization dates;
(b)	Notification if any required air permits have been issued or permit applications have been withdrawn; 
(c)	Notification and dates for when generator construction has commenced or has been completed; and
(d)	A declaration of adequate water supplies (Section 8, Attachment B, Declaration of Adequate Water Supplies), unless the generator is powered by wind or PhotoVoltaic (PV) equipment or is a battery Energy Storage System (ESS).
(8)	If during the course of the GIM process, additional information is needed by ERCOT or the TDSP from the IE, the IE must respond to the request within ten Business Days.  The IE will be notified that action is required by its ERCOT contact.
5.2.5	Inactive Status
(1)	Any proposed large generator or proposed modification to a large generator subject to Section 5, Generator Interconnection or Modification, shall be given the status of “Inactive” if it has not met the conditions for inclusion in the ERCOT planning models, as specified in Section 6.9, Addition of Proposed Generation to the Planning Models, within two years of the date on which ERCOT posts the final FIS elements for the proposed generator to the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area.  
(2)	Any proposed small generator or proposed modification to a small generator subject to Section 5 shall be given the status of “Inactive” if it has not met the conditions for inclusion in the ERCOT Network Operations Model within six months of the date on which the interconnection request was initiated.  
(3)	An IE may also elect “Inactive” status for any proposed generator after the FIS has been requested.  For any interconnection-related study or process in progress when the IE elects “Inactive” status, the Entity conducting the study or performing the process may, at its own discretion, stop work on the study, not include the generator in the study, or discontinue any process related to this project.  
(4)	If a proposed small or large generator had met the requirements of Section 6.9 and is included in the planning models prior to electing a status change to “Inactive”, the proposed small or large generator shall be removed from the planning models during the next available planning model case build.
(5)	A proposed small or large generator whose IE has elected “Inactive” status may elect to change to “Planned” status if ERCOT determines that it still meets the requirements of Section 6.9 and not more than two years have elapsed since the date any one or more of the studies in the most recent FIS was posted to the MIS Secure Area.  If more than two years have elapsed, then the IE shall restart the FIS process for the project, unless ERCOT notifies the IE in writing that such studies are unnecessary. 
(6)	A proposed small or large generator that was given the status of “Inactive” because it had not met the conditions for inclusion in the ERCOT planning models shall be assigned the status of “Planned” and included in the ERCOT planning models if ERCOT determines that the generator meets the requirements of Section 6.9, and if not more than two years have elapsed since the date any one of more of the studies in the most recent FIS was posted to the MIS Secure Area.  If more than two years have elapsed since posting of the FIS, then the IE shall restart the FIS process for the project, unless ERCOT notifies the IE in writing that such studies are unnecessary. 
(7)	For any proposed small or large generator with the status of “Inactive”, the IE associated with the project shall not be required to submit the semiannual declaration or any other information that would otherwise be required under this Planning Guide and ERCOT shall exclude the Resource’s capacity from each monthly Generator Interconnection Status report that is issued while the IE is in “Inactive” status.  
(8)	If a transmission-connected project has been “Inactive” for five years, ERCOT may cancel the project pursuant to Section 5.2.6, Project Cancellation Due to Failure to Comply with Requirements.  At any time prior to cancellation of its project, an IE may submit a request to terminate the project’s “Inactive” status and return the project to “Planned” status if ERCOT determines that the IE has provided complete and updated project information. 
(9)	If a distribution-connected project has been “Inactive” for one year or the TDSP sends notification of a cancellation, ERCOT may cancel the project pursuant to Section 5.2.6.  At any time prior to cancellation of its project, an IE may submit a request to terminate the project’s “Inactive” status and return the project to “Planned” status if ERCOT determines that the IE has provided complete and updated project information.
5.2.6	Project Cancellation Due to Failure to Comply with Requirements
(1)	If at any time ERCOT determines that an IE with a project in “Planned” status has failed to meet any requirement of the ERCOT Protocols or this Planning Guide, including, without limitation, any requirement to provide materially accurate or complete information concerning any proposed small or large generator, ERCOT may send a notice of potential cancellation to the IE via email or through the online RIOO system.  The notice of potential cancellation shall describe the failure and provide notice of ERCOT’s intent to cancel the project if the failure is not remedied. 
(2)	Within 60 days of receiving ERCOT’s notification of potential cancellation, the IE shall correct the failure or provide information that explains to ERCOT’s satisfaction why the IE cannot reasonably comply with ERCOT requirements or why the failure to comply cannot reasonably be remedied.  
(3)	If the IE fails to respond to ERCOT’s notice of potential cancellation within 60 days, or if ERCOT determines that, notwithstanding the IE’s response, the IE has neither satisfactorily resolved the deficiency nor provided an explanation that, in ERCOT’s sole judgment, justifies the deficiency, ERCOT may cancel the IE’s project no sooner than 30 days after providing notice to the IE that the project will be canceled.  
(4)	If at any time before cancellation ERCOT determines that the IE did not fail to meet any requirement of the ERCOT Protocols or the Planning Guide or that any failure has been satisfactorily remedied, then ERCOT shall notify the IE that the concern has been resolved and the potential cancellation has been rescinded.  
(5)	At any time prior to cancellation, an IE may request a change in the status of the project to “Inactive” status as provided in Section 5.2.5, Inactive Status.
(6)	Once a project is canceled, it is permanently removed from the GIM process and must be resubmitted to be reconsidered for interconnection.

5.2.7	Voluntary Project Cancellation
(1)	An IE may cancel the GIM process at any time upon providing written notice of cancellation via the RIOO system.  The RIOO system will notify ERCOT and TDSPs of any cancellation.  Cancellation of the GIM process does not affect any obligation the IE may have previously incurred, including any obligation to render payment to the TSP for FIS studies.
5.2.8	Interconnection Agreements and Procedures
5.2.8.1	Standard Generation Interconnection Agreement for Transmission-Connected Generators
(1)	As a condition for obtaining transmission service, an IE for any transmission-connected generator must execute a Standard Generation Interconnection Agreement (SGIA) with its TSP.  A template of the SGIA can be found on the ERCOT website.
(2)	The TSP must submit a change request via the online RIOO system to transmit a copy of the signed SGIA to ERCOT within ten Business Days of execution.
(3)	The TSP must submit a change request via the online RIOO system to transmit a copy of any public, financially-binding agreement between the IE and the TSP, other than an SGIA, under which the interconnection for a transmission-connected generator will be constructed.  The agreement must be submitted within ten Business Days of execution.
(4)	The TSP must submit a change request via the online RIOO system within ten Business Days of receiving both a notice to proceed with construction of the interconnection for the transmission-connected generator and the financial security sufficient to fund the interconnection facilities pursuant to either agreement addressed in paragraphs (2) or (3) above. 
[PGRR088:  Insert paragraph (5) below upon system implementation:] 
(5)	Within ten Business Days of providing the TSP both the notice to proceed with construction of the interconnection for the Generation Resource and the financial security sufficient to fund the interconnection facilities pursuant to the SGIA, the IE must submit a change request via the online RIOO system to provide the financial security amount if it is not redacted in the public version of the SGIA filed with the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT).  ERCOT will include in the monthly Generator Interconnection Status report the name of the interconnecting TSP and the total amount of financial security sufficient to fund the interconnection facilities, if provided by the IE.
5.2.8.2	Interconnection Agreement for Distribution-Connected Generators
(1)      	Each IE for a distribution-connected generator must provide ERCOT and the relevant TSP a copy of its fully executed applicable Distribution Service Provider (DSP) interconnection agreement, or a letter attesting that the interconnection agreement with the DSP has been executed, as a condition for interconnecting a proposed generation project at distribution voltage in ERCOT.
5.2.8.3	Provisions for Municipally Owned Utilities and Cooperatives
(1)	A Municipally Owned Utility (MOU) or Electric Cooperative (EC) developing a proposed generator that will interconnect to its own system is not required to execute an interconnection agreement.  However, an MOU or EC must execute an SGIA or other appropriate interconnection agreement if its proposed generator would interconnect with another TDSP’s facilities.
(2)	A letter from a duly authorized official from the MOU or EC confirming the Entity’s intent to construct and operate the proposed generator and to interconnect such generator with its own transmission or distribution facilities will be deemed by ERCOT to be sufficient as a public commitment by the MOU or EC and will have the same impact as an interconnection agreement for all purposes.  The MOU or EC shall submit the letter to ERCOT via the online RIOO system.  
5.2.9	Self-Limiting Facilities
(1)	An IE may elect to designate any proposed new or modified Generation Resource or ESR as a component of a Self-Limiting Facility for the purposes of the GIM process.  Upon such designation, all studies and tests undertaken pursuant to this Section 5, Generator Interconnection or Modification, or that may otherwise be required as a condition for interconnection shall use the Self-Limiting Facility’s proposed MW Injection limit as the maximum potential injection to the ERCOT System, and, if applicable, shall use the Self-Limiting Facility’s MW Withdrawal limit as the maximum potential withdrawal from the ERCOT System, notwithstanding the nameplate capacity values provided.  
(2)	Any Generation Resource or ESR that has been studied and tested in the GIM process as a component of a Self-Limiting Facility may not, at any time during or after this process, increase the MW Injection limit or MW Withdrawal limit of the Self-Limiting Facility beyond the value or values that were used in these studies and tests without re-initiating the GIM process to evaluate the impacts of the increased value or values.
[PGRR092:  Replace Section 5.2.9 above upon system implementation of NPRR1077:]
5.2.9	Self-Limiting Facilities
(1)	An IE may elect to designate any proposed new or modified Generation Resource, ESR, or SOG as a component of a Self-Limiting Facility for the purposes of the GIM process.  Upon such designation, all studies and tests undertaken pursuant to this Section 5, Generator Interconnection or Modification, or that may otherwise be required as a condition for interconnection shall use the Self-Limiting Facility’s proposed MW Injection limit as the maximum potential injection to the ERCOT System, and, if applicable, shall use the Self-Limiting Facility’s MW Withdrawal limit as the maximum potential withdrawal from the ERCOT System, notwithstanding the nameplate capacity values provided.  
(2)	Any Generation Resource, ESR, or SOG that has been studied and tested in the GIM process as a component of a Self-Limiting Facility may not, at any time during or after this process, increase the MW Injection limit or MW Withdrawal limit of the Self-Limiting Facility beyond the value or values that were used in these studies and tests without re-initiating the GIM process to evaluate the impacts of the increased value or values.

5.3	Interconnection Study Procedures for Large Generators
(1)	The provisions in this Section establish the procedures for conducting the Security Screening Study and Full Interconnection Study (FIS) for each new or modified large generator, as that term is defined by paragraph (3) of Section 5.2.1, Applicability.
5.3.1	Security Screening Study
(1)	For each Generator Interconnection or Modification (GIM) submitted for a large generator, ERCOT will conduct a steady-state Security Screening Study, including power-flow and transfer studies, based on the expected in-service year to identify potential generation dispatch limitations based on the site proposed by the Interconnecting Entity (IE).  
(a)	The Security Screening Study is a high-level review of the project and generally includes a number of initial assumptions from both ERCOT and the IE.  In accordance with P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.198, Initiating Transmission Service, ERCOT will establish the scope of the Security Screening Study that will include a determination of the need for a more in-depth Subsynchronous Resonance (SSR) study.  The SSR vulnerability of all Generation Resources applicable under Section 5, Generator Interconnection or Modification, will be assessed pursuant to Protocol Section 3.22.1.2, Generation Resource or Energy Storage Resource Interconnection Assessment. 
[PGRR118:  Replace paragraph (a) above with the following upon system implementation of NPRR1246:]
(a)	The Security Screening Study is a high-level review of the project and generally includes a number of initial assumptions from both ERCOT and the IE.  In accordance with P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.198, Initiating Transmission Service, ERCOT will establish the scope of the Security Screening Study that will include a determination of the need for a more in-depth Subsynchronous Resonance (SSR) study.  The SSR vulnerability of all Generation Resources and Energy Storage Resources (ESRs) applicable under Section 5, Generator Interconnection or Modification, will be assessed pursuant to Protocol Section 3.22.1.2, Generation Resource or Energy Storage Resource Interconnection Assessment. 
(b)	At its sole discretion, ERCOT may waive the requirement for a Security Screening Study for a GIM.
(2)	The results of the Security Screening Study will provide an indication of the level at which the proposed generator can expect to operate simultaneously with other known generators in the area before significant transmission additions or enhancements may be required.  During the course of the Security Screening Study, ERCOT may consult with the affected Transmission Service Provider(s) (TSP(s)), if needed, to identify the most efficient means of providing transmission service.
(3)	During the Security Screening Study phase of the GIM process, and in accordance with the Protocols, all data, documents, and other information required by ERCOT from an IE related to a request for interconnection are considered Protected Information pursuant to Protocol Section 1.3.1.1, Items Considered Protected Information, to the extent that such information is not otherwise publicly available.  Accordingly, ERCOT shall not publicly release any of the protected data, documents, or other information during the Security Screening Study phase except to TSPs.  Information about interconnection requests in the Security Screening Study phase will only be released publicly in aggregated amounts.
(4)	Upon completion of the Security Screening Study, ERCOT will present the IE with a preliminary report that will inform the IE about the suitability of the proposed Point of Interconnection (POI) for the proposed MW amount.  This report does not imply any commitment by ERCOT or any TSP to recommend or construct transmission additions or enhancements.  The report will also contain a description of the SSR assessment performed as part of the Security Screening Study and any conclusions resulting from the SSR assessment.
(5)	Within 180 days of the date ERCOT notifies the IE of the Security Screening Study results, the IE must notify ERCOT, via the online Resource Integration and Ongoing Operations (RIOO) system, of its desire to pursue an FIS, otherwise ERCOT shall consider the GIM withdrawn by the IE.  ERCOT will begin initiation and coordination of the FIS only after receiving this Notification and all required items from the IE for the FIS application to be approved.  TSPs will receive a RIOO system automated email when ERCOT determines the FIS application is complete. 
(6)	After the expiration of the 180-day period, an IE must submit a new GIM for a Security Screening Study and must again pay the appropriate fee.  The IE will also be required to submit any updates or changes in the project’s data to ERCOT.
(7)	For any interconnection request that proposes either a large generator that would be interconnected at distribution voltage or a qualifying modification to a large generator that is interconnected at distribution voltage, ERCOT will not initiate a Security Screening Study or propose any FIS kickoff meeting until the IE first provides written confirmation from the affected Distribution Service Provider (DSP) stating that the DSP has evaluated the proposed project, determined that the interconnection of the generator at distribution voltage is electrically feasible, and identified the necessary upgrades to accommodate the proposed interconnection.  In conducting a Security Screening Study for such an interconnection request, ERCOT shall evaluate only the transmission-level impacts, if any, of the proposed generator, and the affected DSP shall provide ERCOT any information concerning the DSP’s facilities or the proposed generator interconnection as may be requested by ERCOT for the purpose of completing the Security Screening Study.
5.3.2	Full Interconnection Study
(1)	An FIS consists of the set of steady-state, stability, short-circuit, facility, and/or other relevant studies that are necessary to determine the reliability impact of a large generator on affected Transmission Facilities and identify the Transmission Facilities that are needed to reliably interconnect the new or modified generator to the ERCOT System.  The FIS is not intended to determine the deliverability of power from the proposed Generation Resource to market or to ensure that the proposed Generation Resource does not experience any congestion-related curtailment.
[PGRR118:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation of NPRR1246:]
(1)	An FIS consists of the set of steady-state, stability, short-circuit, facility, and/or other relevant studies that are necessary to determine the reliability impact of a large generator on affected Transmission Facilities and identify the Transmission Facilities that are needed to reliably interconnect the new or modified generator to the ERCOT System.  The FIS is not intended to determine the deliverability of power from the proposed Generation Resource or ESR to market or to ensure that the proposed Generation Resource or ESR does not experience any congestion-related curtailment.
(2)	For an interconnection request involving a large generator interconnecting at distribution voltage, the FIS shall evaluate only the transmission-level impacts, if any, of the proposed generator, and the affected DSP shall provide the lead TSP all information concerning the DSP’s facilities or the proposed generator interconnection as may be requested by the TSP for the purpose of completing any one or more FIS studies.  
(3)	To initiate an FIS, the IE must submit each of the following via the online RIOO system:
(a)	A request to proceed with the FIS via the online RIOO system;
(b)	Complete Resource Registration data in the format prescribed by ERCOT with applicable information required for interconnection studies identified in the Resource Registration Glossary for the applicable Resource type.  This information includes, among other things, the appropriate dynamic model for the proposed generator and results of the model quality tests and associated simulation files as described in paragraph (5)(c) of Section 6.2, Dynamics Model Development, subject to performance and usability verification by the lead TSP with approval from ERCOT through the FIS process.  Dynamic model data shall be provided using the appropriate dynamic model template.  Paragraph (5) of Section 6.2 and the Dynamics Working Group Procedure Manual contain more detail and IE dynamics data requirements.  Data submitted for transient stability models shall be compatible with the current version of the planning and operations model software as described in the Dynamics Working Group Procedure Manual.  If no compatible model exists, the IE shall work with a consultant or software vendor to develop and supply accurate/appropriate models along with other associated data.  These models shall be incorporated into the standard model libraries of all software packages;
(c)	An FIS Application Fee as described in the ERCOT Fee Schedule in the ERCOT Nodal Protocols, with the MW amount determined based on: 
(i)	The MW of additional installed capacity for GIMs not meeting paragraph (1)(c)(ii) of Section 5.2.1, Applicability; or
(ii)	Total MW capacity for GIMs meeting paragraph (1)(c)(ii) of Section 5.2.1; 
(d)	Proof of site control as described in Section 5.3.2.1, Proof of Site Control; and
(e)	A declaration in Section 8, Attachment C, Declaration of Department of Defense Notification, certifying that:  
(i)	The IE has notified the Department of Defense (DOD) Siting Clearinghouse of the proposed Generation Resource and requested an informal or formal review as described in 32 C.F.R. § 211.1; or 
(ii)	The IE’s proposed Generation Resource is not required to provide notice to the DOD and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) because the project does not meet the criteria requiring notice to the FAA under 14 C.F.R. § 77.9.
[PGRR118:  Replace paragraph (e) above with the following upon system implementation of NPRR1246:]
(e)	A declaration in Section 8, Attachment C, Declaration of Department of Defense Notification, certifying that:  
(i)	The IE has notified the Department of Defense (DOD) Siting Clearinghouse of the proposed Generation Resource or ESR and requested an informal or formal review as described in 32 C.F.R. § 211.1; or 
(ii)	The IE’s proposed Generation Resource or ESR is not required to provide notice to the DOD and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) because the project does not meet the criteria requiring notice to the FAA under 14 C.F.R. § 77.9.
(4)	The IE can request an FIS for an active project before completion of the Security Screening Study or at any other time after ERCOT deems the initial GIM application complete, but must comply with the timeline set forth in paragraph (5) of Section 5.3.1, Security Screening Study.  Requesting both studies at the same time may shorten the overall time to complete the GIM process due to overlap of work on both studies.
(5)	Payment of the ERCOT FIS Application Fee does not affect the IE’s independent responsibility to pay for FIS studies conducted by the TSP or for any DSP studies.
(6)	ERCOT shall manage a confidential email list (Transmission Owner Generation Interconnection) to facilitate communication of confidential GIM-related information among TSP(s) and ERCOT.  Membership to this email list will be limited to ERCOT and appropriate TSP personnel. 
(7)       If any of the items required for the FIS request pursuant to paragraph (3) above are deemed not acceptable by ERCOT or are not submitted, then the IE must submit any omitted items and resolve and resubmit any deficient items.  If the FIS request is not deemed complete by ERCOT within 60 days of submission of the FIS request, the FIS will be considered to have not been requested for the purpose of meeting paragraph (5) of Section 5.3.1.  If the 180-day limit specified in paragraph (5) of Section 5.3.1 has expired, the GIM will be cancelled immediately.  If the 180-day limit has not expired and the deficiency is not resolved before the 180-day limit, the GIM will be cancelled upon expiration of the 180-day limit.

(1)	To establish proof of site control for the purposes of paragraph (3)(d) of Section 5.3.2, Full Interconnection Study, the IE must demonstrate through an affiliated company, through a trustee, or directly in its name that:
(a)	The IE is the owner in fee simple of the real property to be utilized by the facilities for which any new generation interconnection is sought;
(b)	The IE holds a valid written leasehold interest in the real property to be utilized by the facilities for which new generation interconnection is sought;
(c)	The IE holds a valid written option to purchase or obtain a leasehold interest in the real property to be utilized by the facilities for which new generation interconnection is sought; or
(d)	The IE holds a duly executed written contract to purchase or obtain a leasehold interest in the real property to be utilized by the facilities for which new generation interconnection is sought.
(2)	The IE must notify ERCOT of any substantive change in status of the arrangement used to demonstrate site control.
(3)	If the IE fails to maintain site control at any point before the date the generator is fully constructed, ERCOT will consider the interconnection request withdrawn as of the date of the loss of site control unless the applicant can show within 30 days that it has re-established site control or has established control of a new site that would not result in any material modification of any interconnection study requested under the current application.
5.3.2.2	Full Interconnection Study Scoping Process
(1)	Within ten Business Days of the IE’s submission of the items required by paragraph (3) of Section 5.3.2, Full Interconnection Study, ERCOT will designate a TSP to lead the FIS and will contact that TSP to schedule an FIS kickoff meeting.  ERCOT will select the lead TSP based upon a preliminary analysis of the most likely POI, or for a distribution-connected project, the most likely transmission substation for the proposed interconnection.  If an IE has previously developed a generation project in ERCOT with the selected TSP, the IE, ERCOT, and the TSP may agree to forgo the kickoff meeting.  If they so agree, the timeline for the IE and TSP to reach agreement on the FIS scope will start on the date ERCOT notifies the TSP of the IE’s decision to proceed with the FIS.
(2)	ERCOT will notify all other TSP(s) of the FIS request via the online RIOO system.  It is the responsibility of each TSP to determine if the proposed project would have a material impact on its Transmission Facilities and to decide whether and to what extent it should participate in the FIS.  The assistance of more than one TSP may be required in areas where Transmission Facilities are provided by multiple TSPs.  In these cases it may be necessary for the IE to execute study agreements with multiple TSPs.  
(3)	Each TSP desiring to participate in the FIS shall promptly notify the lead TSP via email.  The lead TSP must include all interested TSPs in the FIS to the extent such involvement is reasonable.
(4)	At the FIS kickoff meeting, the IE will present the proposed project and ERCOT will review the results of the Security Screening Study.  The lead TSP will facilitate a general discussion of the preliminary study scope of work for the FIS.
(5)	Any SSR studies required under Protocol Section 3.22.1.2, Generation Resource or Energy Storage Resource Interconnection Assessment, shall be scoped at the same time as the FIS but do not need to be included as part of the FIS. 
(6)	Following the kickoff meeting, the IE and the TSP(s) must agree to the terms of the FIS study as a condition for proceeding with the FIS studies.  The FIS study agreement must include all assumptions, timetables, study costs, and payment schedules, and the determination of all requirements for interconnection.  The IE and TSP(s) may divide the FIS into distinct study phases, each requiring IE approval to proceed.  All payments for the FIS studies shall be remitted directly to the TSP(s) completing the studies.  
(a)	The FIS must include all study elements required by Section 5.3.2.4, Full Interconnection Study Elements, unless ERCOT and the TSP(s) determine that one or more studies should not be performed.  ERCOT and the TSP(s) shall consider the Security Screening Study and any information provided by the IE when developing the FIS scope. 
(b)	The requirement for one or more of the FIS study elements identified in Section 5.3.2.4 may be waived for projects involving any distribution-connected generator or any project meeting paragraph (1)(c)(ii) of Section 5.2.1, Applicability, if mutually agreed upon by ERCOT and the TSP(s).  In order to aid in the determination of whether or not FIS study waivers are appropriate, ERCOT and the TSP(s) may request additional data and information from the IE beyond what is required by Section 5.2.2, Initiation of Generator Interconnection or Modification, Section 5.3.2, and Section 5.5, Generator Commissioning and Continuing Operations.
(7)	The TSP(s) shall submit the FIS study agreement via the online RIOO system.  The online RIOO system will provide notification via an email to ERCOT and other TSP(s) of availability of the FIS study agreement for review and comment.  Comments must be made within ten Business Days.
(8)	If the IE and TSP(s) cannot agree to the terms of the FIS study within 60 days, ERCOT will attempt to mediate an agreement.  If mediation is unsuccessful, ERCOT will cancel the interconnection request if the IE does not agree to the proposed terms within ten days of being notified that the mediation was unsuccessful.
(9)	The TSP shall notify ERCOT by submitting a change request via the online RIOO system within ten Business Days of the following events:
(a)	Signing of the FIS study agreement; and 
(b)	Funding of the FIS study agreement.
5.3.2.3	Full Interconnection Study Description and Methodology
(1)	The FIS consists of a series of distinct study elements.  The specific elements that will be included in a particular FIS will be stated in the FIS agreement, and not all of the study elements specified below must be included if the IE and the TSP agree that one or more studies are unnecessary.  The primary purpose of the FIS is to determine the most effective and efficient manner in which to achieve the proposed project while continuing to maintain the reliability of the ERCOT System by ensuring compliance with all North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards, Protocols, this Planning Guide and the Operating Guides.  The scenarios and base cases being used for these studies to determine potential transmission limitations will be documented in the FIS study scope.
(2)	Each proposed generator that requires a separate physical transmission interconnection will be treated as an individual study to be analyzed separately from all other such requests unless otherwise agreed by the IE and TSP(s) in the interconnection study agreement.
(3)	The FIS process includes developing and analyzing various computer model simulations of the existing and proposed ERCOT generation/transmission system.  The results from these simulations will be utilized by the TSP(s) to determine the impact of the proposed interconnection.
(4)	The TSP(s) will examine normal transmission operations as well as potentially adverse, or contingency, conditions in order to identify and analyze the reliability and effectiveness of various interconnection design alternatives in alleviating or mitigating any undesirable performance of the interconnection under a variety of operating conditions.  The study should include analysis demonstrating the adequate reliability of any temporary interconnection configurations.
(5)	In comparing interconnection alternatives, the TSP(s) will consider such information as interconnection cost and construction schedule, impact to short- and long-range reliability, operational flexibility, and compatibility with future transmission plans.  The TSP(s) may consider interconnection alternatives not suggested by the IE.
(6)	The TSP(s) may update the final FIS report to reflect changes to the ERCOT System (i.e., new Standard Generation Interconnection Agreements (SGIAs)) after the report is completed and before the SGIA is executed.
5.3.2.4	Full Interconnection Study Elements
5.3.2.4.1	Steady-State Analysis
(1)	The steady-state interconnection study base case shall be created from the most recently approved Steady State Working Group (SSWG) base case.  TSP(s) or ERCOT may remove any future (currently nonexistent) facility from the steady-state interconnection study base case if either determines that the facility may significantly affect the interconnection study results and the facility has not already undergone appropriate review by the Regional Planning Group (RPG).  In addition, ERCOT and TSP(s) may include other publicly disclosed projects in the steady-state interconnection study base case.  ERCOT may request a list of the interconnection requests included in the FIS by the TSP(s).  Modifications to the SSWG base case, necessary to evaluate the study results, shall be documented in the FIS but not to the extent that documenting the modifications would reveal Protected Information.
(2)	The TSP(s) shall perform contingency analyses as required by the NERC Reliability Standards, Protocols, this Planning Guide and the Operating Guides and identify any additional facilities that may be necessary to ensure that expected system performance conforms to these standards.  The study shall identify any system limitations that would prevent the generator from achieving full output.
(3)	Loss-of-generation analyses shall assume that the lost generation will be replaced from all remaining Generation Resources in proportion to their nominal capacity (i.e., inertial response), and shall consider the generation limit of each Generation Resource.
[PGRR118:  Replace paragraph (3) above with the following upon system implementation of NPRR1246:]
(3)	Loss-of-generation analyses shall assume that the lost generation will be replaced from all remaining Generation Resources and/or ESRs in proportion to their nominal capacity (i.e., inertial response and primary frequency response), and shall consider the generation limit of each Generation Resource and ESR.
(4)	The lead TSP is responsible for completing an analysis of any contingency events or Outages that could result in a violation of the NERC Reliability Standards, Protocols, this Planning Guide and the Operating Guides, regardless of which TSP owns the facilities involved.  The results of this analysis will be shared with TSP(s) that have facilities involved in planning criteria violations and those affected TSP(s) will be responsible for evaluating the validity of the anticipated violations.
5.3.2.4.2	System Protection (Short-Circuit) Analysis
(1)	The FIS agreement will specify locations where available short-circuit fault duty will be identified, calculated, and documented.
(2)	If any of the required transmission system facilities identified in the FIS facility study associated with the GIM result in violations of the TSP’s short circuit criteria, the TSP shall plan and provide facilities to address such violations.  The TSP will determine the maximum available fault currents at the interconnection substation for determining switching device interrupting capabilities and protective relay settings.
5.3.2.4.3	Dynamic and Transient Stability (Unit Stability, Voltage) Analysis
(1)	At the discretion of the lead TSP or ERCOT, the lead TSP will perform transient stability studies if necessary to meet NERC Reliability Standards, Protocols, this Planning Guide or the Operating Guides applicable to the generator or to the ERCOT System.  If the lead TSP conducting a stability study decides such study is not required, the lead TSP shall provide a written justification in lieu of the study report.  
(2)	When performing such studies, all operational and planned generators which have met the requirements of Section 6.9, Addition of Proposed Generation to the Planning Models, in the area of the study shall be dispatched at full net output in at least one of the scenarios/cases evaluated by the lead TSP.  The dispatch level may be reduced to respect any published stability limits or to reach a power flow solution.  If any Generation Resources in the study area are not dispatched at full output, the study report shall include the technical rationale.  Any resulting increase in generation will be balanced as addressed in the FIS agreement.
(3)	Stability study base cases shall be formed from the latest available approved SSWG base cases consistent with the most recently approved Dynamics Working Group (DWG) stability data base.  The initial transmission configuration in the area of study included in a stability study base case shall be identical to that used in the steady-state studies of the same period.  Any previously identified transmission improvements that will not be in service prior to the Initial Synchronization of the proposed generator shall not be included in the stability study base case.
(4)	Transient stability studies will analyze the performance of the proposed generator and the ERCOT System in terms of angular stability, voltage stability and excessive frequency excursions.  Additional studies may include small signal stability or critical clearing time analyses where the number of cycles for which a transmission line can sustain a fault without causing loss of synchronism of any of the Resource is compared to the response of the protection systems.  Such studies should incorporate reasonable and conservative assumptions regarding plant operating conditions.  Proposed analyses shall be identified and defined in the FIS agreement. 
(5)	All stability studies shall be performed in accordance with NERC Reliability Standards, Protocols, this Planning Guide and the Operating Guides.  The stability study portion of the FIS shall document any instability identified through performance of the study. 
(6)	If the TSP identifies instability (other than instability identified for extreme events) in the stability portion of the FIS, the following steps will be taken after the FIS is deemed complete and posted to the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area in accordance with Section 5.3.2.5, FIS Report and Follow-up:
(a)	The IE and TSP shall investigate alternative solutions to resolve the instability through changes to the proposed generator and report their findings to ERCOT.  If changes to the generator are determined by ERCOT to be feasible, the IE shall implement the changes prior to Initial Synchronization.  
(b)	If ERCOT determines that changes to the proposed generator are not feasible to resolve the identified instability, ERCOT shall notify the TSP and IE, and the TSP shall investigate a transmission improvement to resolve the instability and report its findings to ERCOT. 
(c)	If ERCOT determines that a proposed transmission improvement is feasible to resolve the identified instability, the TSP shall proceed with implementing the transmission improvement, in accordance with Protocol Section 3.11.4, Regional Planning Group Project Review Process, identified in paragraph (6)(b) above after the requirements of Section 6.9 have been met for the proposed generator.
(d)	If the transmission improvement identified in paragraph (6)(b) or (c) above cannot be implemented prior to Initial Synchronization, ERCOT shall determine the appropriate operating limit, including evaluating the feasibility of a proposed Remedial Action Scheme (RAS) that may mitigate the limit when a market solution is not available, in accordance with Section 5.3.5, ERCOT Quarterly Stability Assessment, prior to Initial Synchronization.
5.3.2.4.4	Facility Study
(1)	The facility study provides complete details of the transmission and substation facilities needed to connect a generator to a new or existing substation on the ERCOT Transmission Grid.  These details include conceptual design descriptions, construction milestones, and cost estimates.  A facility study is not required for a large generator interconnecting directly to a DSP’s distribution facilities unless transmission facilities are required to be constructed.
(2)	In conducting the facility study, if the lead TSP determines that the costs of the Transmission Facilities needed to connect the proposed generator are expected to exceed $25,000,000, the lead TSP will submit a change request via the online RIOO system to communicate this finding to ERCOT and other TSP(s) within ten Business Days of such determination.  This communication will include all available information upon which that finding is based, including but not limited to:
(a)	A description of the Transmission Facilities needed to connect the proposed generator;
(b)	Information necessary to modify a power-flow case to include those facilities;
(c)	Any information obtained from the IE that would be helpful in modeling the proposed generator for the study; and
(d)	The estimated cost of the facilities. 
(3)	The lead TSP will notify the RPG email list via email within ten Business Days following the later of the completion of the facility study or the signing of an SGIA when the cost of the Transmission Facilities needed to connect the generator is expected to be greater than $25,000,000.
5.3.2.5	FIS Report and Follow-up
(1)	The TSP(s) will submit to ERCOT and to the other TSP(s) via the online RIOO system a preliminary report of findings and recommendations for each of the FIS elements.
(2)	Any questions, comments, proposed revisions, or clarifications by any party shall be made in writing to the TSP(s) within ten Business Days after the issuance of each study report, which may cover one or more study elements.  ERCOT can extend this review period by an additional 20 Business Days and an email will be sent to notify the affected TSP(s) and the IE that it needs additional time to review the report.
(3)	After considering the information received from ERCOT and other TSPs, the study element(s) report will be deemed complete and a final report shall be provided, via the online RIOO system, to ERCOT and all TSPs.  The TSP(s) conducting the FIS shall submit via the online RIOO system, the SSR analysis, if required, as a separate document from the remainder of the report.
(4)	Each final study element report will be available via the online RIOO system after the report has been deemed complete and marked “final” and will be posted to the MIS Secure Area within ten Business Days.  Coincident with posting of the final FIS study element reports to the MIS Secure Area, ERCOT will notify the TSP and the IE when each study element report is posted.  The TSP shall provide a copy of each final report to the IE upon request.   
(5)	The study element(s) report shall not contain sensitive information including, but not limited to, confidential plant design information including stability study model data and parameters and contingencies causing instability.  The TSP(s) shall provide this information to ERCOT and other TSP(s) upon request.
(6)	The TSP issuing the final FIS element(s) report shall indicate that the report is the final report required by the FIS.  At the end of the ten Business Day review period following the issuance of the final FIS element(s) report, the FIS will be deemed complete and the IE and TSP may execute an SGIA.
(7)	The final FIS element(s) report shall be deemed complete and marked “final” via the online RIOO system at least 45 days prior to the quarterly stability assessment deadline defined in paragraph (2) of Section 5.3.5, ERCOT Quarterly Stability Assessment.
(8)	Should the IE wish to proceed with any proposed transmission-connected project, the IE must execute a new or amended SGIA with the appropriate TSP within 180 days following the completion of the FIS (includes all major study element(s) reports).  Failure to do so may result in a cancellation as described in Section 5.2.6, Project Cancellation Due to Failure to Comply with Requirements.
(9)	During the time after the FIS is completed and before Initial Synchronization, the IE shall notify both ERCOT and the lead TSP(s) of any changes to the assumptions used for the FIS along with a detailed written explanation of why the changes were made.  If the changes substantially differ from the assumptions used for the FIS, ERCOT and the TSP(s) shall determine the impact of the changes on the results of the FIS and, if applicable, SSR studies.  If the changes are determined by ERCOT and lead TSP(s) to have the potential to materially alter the conclusions documented in the FIS, the lead TSP(s) will make appropriate modifications to one or more FIS study elements.  The updated FIS reports will be submitted via the online RIOO system.  Any questions, comments, proposed revisions, or clarifications by any party shall be made in writing to the TSP(s) within ten Business Days after the issuance of an updated study report.  Initial Synchronization of the generator may be delayed pending completion of these modifications to the FIS.
5.3.3	ERCOT Economic Study
(1)	In accordance with paragraph (2) of Protocol Section 3.11.6, Generation Interconnection Process, ERCOT shall perform an independent economic analysis of the Transmission Facilities needed to connect a generator to the ERCOT Transmission Grid, including any new substation that may be needed, and that are expected to cost more than $25,000,000.  This economic analysis is performed only for informational purposes, and no ERCOT endorsement will be provided.   
(2)	The IE shall provide to ERCOT any requested information necessary to accurately represent the generator in the economic study.
(3)	ERCOT will endeavor to complete this economic study within 90 days, and will inform the TSP(s) and IE if additional time is required.  ERCOT will provide the results of the economic study to the IE and to the TSP(s) via the online RIOO system.
5.3.4	Reactive Study
(1)	The IE and the TSP shall coordinate with one another for the IE to complete the reactive study and for the TSP to have the needed data to start the FIS stability study.
(a)	The TSP shall send the preliminary short circuit current for the proposed POI based on the most recent System Protection Working Group (SPWG) base case to the IE within 15 Business Days of an IE request after the FIS study agreement has been signed.
(b)	The IE shall complete a preliminary reactive study to determine the reactive devices that will be needed to meet ERCOT requirements.  Once determined, the IE shall add the reactive devices, if any, to the Resource Registration data and make the updated data available to ERCOT and the TSP via the online RIOO system.
(c)	The TSP shall start the FIS stability study after all the required data is available via the online RIOO system.
(2)	Once the TSP has completed the FIS short circuit study and it is approved by ERCOT and posted to the MIS Secure Area, the IE shall complete and submit the final reactive study via the online RIOO system.
[PGRR076:  Insert paragraph (3) below upon system implementation:]
(3)	For GINR projects attempting to meet the next quarterly stability assessment deadline, pursuant to Section 5.3.5, ERCOT Quarterly Stability Assessment, ERCOT shall approve or comment on the final reactive study according to the following timeline:

(c)	Without guarantee that it will be reviewed prior to the quarterly stability assessment deadline if submitted less than 30 days prior to the quarterly stability assessment deadline.

5.3.5	ERCOT Quarterly Stability Assessment
(1)	ERCOT shall conduct a stability assessment every three months to assess the impact of planned large generators connecting to the ERCOT System.  The assessment shall derive the conditions to be studied with consideration given to the results of the FIS stability studies for large generators, with planned Initial Synchronization in the period under study.  ERCOT may study conditions other than those identified in the FIS stability studies.  
(2)	Large generators that are not included in the assessment as described in this Section as result of the IE failing to meet the prerequisites by the deadlines as listed in the table below will not be eligible for Initial Synchronization during that three-month period.  The timeline for the quarterly stability assessment shall be in accordance with the following table:
Generator Initial Synchronization Date	Last Day for an IE to meet prerequisites as listed in paragraph (4) below	Completion of Quarterly Stability Assessment
Upcoming January, February, March	Prior August 1	End of October

If ERCOT is unable to complete its review prior to the quarterly stability assessment deadline, ERCOT shall not include the Generation Resource or Settlement Only Generator (SOG) in that quarterly stability assessment.
(ii)	Changes to the dynamic data model after the stability study is deemed complete may subject the Generation Resource or SOG to modification of one or more FIS study elements as defined in paragraph (9) of Section 5.3.2.5, FIS Report and Follow-up.  If ERCOT and the lead TSP(s) determine that modifications to one or more FIS study elements are required, then ERCOT shall not include the Generation Resource or SOG in a quarterly stability assessment until the revised FIS has been completed in accordance with paragraph (4)(c)(i) below.
(iii)	If an IE submitted a final dynamic data model at least 45 days prior to the quarterly stability assessment deadline but ERCOT determines that the Generation Resource or SOG is ineligible to be included in a quarterly stability assessment pursuant to paragraphs (4)(b)(i) or (4)(b)(ii) above, ERCOT will send a notification to the IE. 
[PGRR118:  Replace paragraph (b) above with the following upon system implementation of NPRR1246:]
(b)	The IE has provided all generator data in accordance with the Resource Registration Glossary, Planning Model column, including but not limited to steady state, system protection and stability models.
(i)	The IE shall submit the final dynamic data model at least 45 days prior to the quarterly stability assessment deadline described in paragraph (2) above.  If ERCOT is unable to complete its review prior to the quarterly stability assessment deadline, ERCOT shall not include the Generation Resource, ESR or Settlement Only Generator (SOG) in that quarterly stability assessment.
(ii)	Changes to the dynamic data model after the stability study is deemed complete may subject the Generation Resource, ESR, or SOG to modification of one or more FIS study elements as defined in paragraph (9) of Section 5.3.2.5, FIS Report and Follow-up.  If ERCOT and the lead TSP(s) determine that modifications to one or more FIS study elements are required, then ERCOT shall not include the Generation Resource, ESR, or SOG in a quarterly stability assessment until the revised FIS has been completed in accordance with paragraph (4)(c)(i) below.
(iii)	If an IE submitted a final dynamic data model at least 45 days prior to the quarterly stability assessment deadline but ERCOT determines that the Generation Resource, ESR, or SOG is ineligible to be included in a quarterly stability assessment pursuant to paragraphs (4)(b)(i) or (4)(b)(ii) above, ERCOT will send a notification to the IE. 
(c)	The following elements must be complete:

(d)	The data used in the studies identified in paragraph (4)(c) above is consistent with data submitted by the IE as required by Section 6.9. 
(5)	At any time following the inclusion of a large generator in a stability assessment, but before the Initial Synchronization of the generator, if ERCOT determines, in its sole discretion, that the generator no longer meets the prerequisites described in paragraph (4), or that an IE has made a change to the design of the generator that could have a material impact on ERCOT System stability, then ERCOT may refuse to allow Initial Synchronization of the generator, provided that ERCOT shall include the generator in the next quarterly stability assessment period that commences after identification of the material change or after the generator meets the prerequisites specified in paragraph (4), as applicable.  If ERCOT determines, in its sole discretion, that the change to the design of the generator would not have a material impact on ERCOT System stability, then ERCOT may not refuse to allow Initial Synchronization of the generator due to this change.
(6)	ERCOT shall post to the MIS Secure Area a report summarizing the results of the quarterly stability assessment within ten Business Days of completion.
5.4	Interconnection Procedures for Small Generators
5.4.1	Small Generator Review Meetings
(1)	Upon request by an Interconnecting Entity (IE), ERCOT, the Transmission Service Provider (TSP), and if applicable, the Distribution Service Provider (DSP) will have an initial meeting with the IE to discuss the small generator interconnection process and address general information related to the project.

5.4.4	Transmission System Reliability Impact
(1)	ERCOT may delay the synchronization, testing, or commissioning of any generator to the extent it deems necessary to study transmission system impacts of this generator and any other proposed or existing generators.  If, as a result of this study or any previous study, ERCOT determines that the generator would create or contribute to a reliability concern, ERCOT may prohibit the synchronization, testing, or commissioning of the generator until the reliability concern is addressed.   
5.5	Generator Commissioning and Continuing Operations
(1)	For each interconnecting Generation Resource or Energy Storage Resource (ESR), each Interconnecting Entity (IE) shall meet the conditions established by ERCOT before proceeding to Initial Energization, Initial Synchronization, and commercial operations.  These conditions may require proof of meeting applicable ERCOT requirements, which may include, but are not limited to, reactive capability, voltage ride-through standards, dynamic model template submission, Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR), Primary Frequency Response, Power System Stabilizer (PSS), Subsynchronous Resonance (SSR) models, and telemetry.
(2)	Before ERCOT approves Initial Energization for a project that will consume Load other than Wholesale Storage Load (WSL) and that is not behind a Non-Opt-In Entity (NOIE) tie meter:
(a)	The Resource Entity must request an Electric Service Identifier(s) (ESI ID(s)) from the Distribution Service Provider(s) (DSP(s)) that will be serving the Load at the Resource site and provide the ESI ID(s) to ERCOT, as described in paragraph (2) of Protocol Section 10.3.2, ERCOT-Polled Settlement Meters; and
