Planning, documenting, maintaining, or other activities associated with these systems is outside the scope of the DWG. However, because they can affect dynamic performance, the DWG should, on an as needed basis, identify and document protection, control, and RAS systems for inclusion to its dynamic data sets.  Identification of these protection systems will normally require the assistance of individuals or groups outside the DWG. The specific information to be considered for inclusion will depend on the type, purpose, and scope of study.
Protection, control, and RAS systems included in the DWG dynamic data should be in the form of a dynamic model and shall be compatible with the software listed in Section 3.1.1.  Protection, control, and RAS systems adequately modeled for dynamic purposes by other working groups only need to be referenced in the DWG study reports.
The DWG member, as part of the annual dynamic data update, shall review and update as necessary protection, control, and R
