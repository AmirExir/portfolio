	Other DWG Activities 
	Event Simulation
ERCOT will compare dynamic system model performance to that of actual system response data in accordance with NERC MOD-033.  For a selected event, the affected TSP will provide actual measured system behavior data (or a written response that it does not have the requested data) to ERCOT within 30 calendar days of a written request.
	Procedure Manual Revision Guidelines
The DWG is responsible for maintaining and updating this Procedure Manual.  Revisions, additions and/or deletions to this Procedure Manual may be undertaken at such times that the DWG feels it is necessary due to changes in dynamic simulation software or to meet new and/or revised requirements of NERC, ERCOT, or any othe
