uirements for New Equipment
Note: This section addresses the requirements stated in R1 of NERC Standard MOD-032-1 (effective July 1, 2015).
REs are responsible for providing models with model parameters resulting in a tuned model that represents the dynamic performance of the device. Final responsibility for the submission and the accuracy of the dynamic data lies on the RE. ERCOT and the DWG will provide voluntary assistance if requested by REs to complete parameter tuning and prepare model records. The DWG member representing the TSP to which the RE is connected is responsible for working with ERCOT to incorporate the dynamic data received from the RE into the DWG Flat Start cases (.dyr file) during annual updates.
The RE shall fulfill its interconnection data requirement by including acceptable dynamic data and models for their facilities.  The RE may have additional model and data reporting obligations to ensure compliance with NERC reliability standards and/or other requirements.
