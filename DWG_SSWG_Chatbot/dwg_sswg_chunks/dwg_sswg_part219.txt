and should display Resistance and Reactance plotted over 5 to 55 Hz.  Values should be in per-unit on the inverter MVA base.  This test should be conducted under the following conditions:  Strong system (short circuit ratio = 10), unity power factor, Weak System Lagging (short circuit ratio = 1.5, 0.95 lagging power factor), and Weak System Leading (short circuit ratio = 1.5, 0.95 leading power factor).  


	Maintenance of Dynamic Models
Maintenance of the models is the responsibility of the device owner. Models shall be maintained in accordance with Section 3.2.  Any user-written dynamic models shall also be maintained to fulfill the requirements as described in the Planning Guide Section 6.2 and Section 3.1.4 in this manual.
	Dynamic Data for Existing Equipment
“As-built” data is required for all completed facilities in accordance with Section 3.2.  To help ensure that dynamic model data is kept up to date with site-specific settings, paragraph (5)(b) of Planning Guide Section 6.2 in
