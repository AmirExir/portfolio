c) fields.  The phase shift angle is positive when the voltage of the bus corresponding to the referenced winding leads the voltage of the bus connected to the opposite winding.

The phase shift(s) associated with a three-winding transformer is(are) accounted for by the specification of an angle for each of the three windings.  The phase shift angle across a winding is positive when the voltage of the corresponding bus leads the voltage of the star point bus.

The transformer phase shift angle is measured in degrees for both two-winding and three-winding transformers.
4.5.1.8	Tap Data
All transformer tap characteristics should be appropriately modeled.  Such tap characteristics include no-load tap settings and load tap changing (LTC) properties and associated control settings.
4.5.1.8.1	Ratio
The ratio is defined as the transformer off nominal turns ratio and is entered as a non-zero value, typically in per unit. Where the base kV contained in the bus data records for the buses connect
