5.3	Review of NMMS and Topology Processor Compatibility with PSS®E
From time to time, updated versions of PSS®E may require modifications to the methods of extracting necessary power-flow data from NMMS.  For every PSS®E version change, the following evaluation process shall be followed:

1.	Use PSS®E documentation such as release notes and compatibility references to identify new fields and record formats added to a new version of PSS®E.
2.	SSWG determines which, if any, of the new field
