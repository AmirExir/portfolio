3.1.5.1 Simulation Set Up

To examine the dynamic performance of a Generation Facility or dynamic transmission element, all site-specific dynamic models needed to represent the facility shall be included in the test.  Unless otherwise specified, the following model guidelines apply:
	The facility model is connected to a controllable infinite bus whose voltage and frequency can be adjusted for testing.  No exp
