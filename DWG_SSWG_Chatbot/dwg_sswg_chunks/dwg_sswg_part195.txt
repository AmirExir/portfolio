ero voltage dip is applied.
	After the voltage dips:
	Real power should recover to full output within 1.0 seconds of POI voltage recovery to 1.0 pu.
	An explanation, including a reference to any exempt status per ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide Section 2.9.1, shall be provided for models which indicate that the unit trips or fails to meet any of the above performance criteria.

Following are three figures:  The first illustrates the "Legacy” LVRT to be applied at the POI; the second illustrates the “voltage dip” LVRT voltage profile to be applied at the POI for photovoltaic generation resources (PVGRs) and energy storage resources (ESRs), and inverter-based transmission equipment, and the third illustrates the “voltage dip” LVRT voltage profile to be applied at the POI for wind generation resources (WGRs).

 

The figures below include the examples of acceptable and unacceptable responses:
