uncontrolled loss of branches, ending with the formation of sub-network islands.  
Generators disconnected from the System by fault clearing action or by a RAS are not considered out of synchronism.  Similarly, islands formed from being disconnected from the System by fault clearing action or by a RAS are not considered an uncontrolled island.
Sub-network islands have the following characteristics:
	The sub-network islands have both generation and load to support the continuation of the island.  
	The sub-networks formed are not connected to each other.
Uncontrolled islanding in a screening study could cause: 
	Out-of-step generators  
	Off-nominal frequency disturbances 
	Eventual collapse of an island due to frequency or voltage instabilities caused by the generation-load unbalance in the sub-network island.
	Generator Protection Assumptions
