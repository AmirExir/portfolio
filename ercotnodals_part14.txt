5.7.4.1	RUC Capacity-Short Charge
(1)	The dollar amount charged to each QSE, due to capacity shortfalls for a particular RUC, for a 15-minute Settlement Interval, is the QSE’s shortfall ratio share multiplied by the total RUC Make-Whole Payments, including amounts for RMR Units, to all QSEs for that RUC, subject to a cap.  The cap on the charge to each QSE is two multiplied by the total RUC Make-Whole Payments, including amounts for RMR Units, for all QSEs multiplied by that QSE’s capacity shortfall for that RUC process divided by the total capacity of all RUC-committed Resources during that Settlement Interval for the RUC process.  That dollar amount charged to each QSE is calculated as follows:
RUCCSAMT ruc, i, q	=	(-1) * Max [(RUCSFRS ruc, i, q * RUCMWAMTRUCTOT ruc, h), 
(2 * RUCSF ruc, i, q * RUCMWAMTRUCTOT ruc, h / RUCCAPTOT ruc, h)] / 4

(10)	The RUC Shortfall in MW for one QSE for one 15-minute Settlement Interval, as measured at Real-Time, but including capacity from IRRs as seen in the RUC snapshot, is:
RUCSFADJ ruc, q, i	=	Max (0, (( RTAML q, p, i) *4) – ( HASLSNAP ruc, q, r, h + RUCCAPADJ q, i))
(11)	The amount of capacity that a QSE had in Real-Time for a 15-minute Settlement Interval, excluding capacity from IRRs, is:

[NPRR1009, NPRR1014, NPRR1029, NPRR1032, and NPRR1236:  Replace applicable portions of Section 5.7.4.1.1 above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project for NPRR1009 and NPRR1236; or upon system implementation for NPRR1014, NPRR1029, or NPRR1032:]
5.7.4.1.1	Capacity Shortfall Ratio Share
(1)	In calculating the shortfall amount for each QSE, the Resource capacity (RCAPSNAP and RCAPADJ) shall be calculated for a Generation Resource that meets any of the following conditions: 
(a)	QSE-committed;  
(b)	Planning to operate as a Quick Start Generation Resource (QSGR) for the Settlement Interval as shown by the COP Status of OFFQS in the RUC Snapshot for the RUC Process and/or Adjustment Period; or
(c)	A Switchable Generation Resource (SWGR) that is released by a non-ERCOT Control Area Operator (CAO) to operate in the ERCOT Control Area due to an ERCOT RUC instruction for an actual or anticipated EEA condition and that is shown as On-Line in its COP; or 
(d)	If the Settlement Interval is a RUCAC-Interval, the Combined Cycle Generation Resource that was QSE-committed at the time the RUCAC was issued, excluding the condition for SWGRs as describe in paragraph (c) above.
(2)	In calculating the amount short for each QSE, the available capacity of an IRR when determining responsibility for the corresponding RUC charges shall be the lesser of the HSL value, as reflected in the COP, and the Wind-powered Generation Resource Production Potential (WGRPP), as described in Section 4.2.2, Wind-Powered Generation Resource Production Potential, for a Wind-powered Generation Resource (WGR), or the PhotoVoltaic Generation Resource Production Potential (PVGRPP), as described in Section 4.2.3, PhotoVoltaic Generation Resource Production Potential, for a PhotoVoltaic Generation Resource (PVGR), at the time of RUC execution.  For an IRR, the RCAPSNAP variable used below shall be equal to the minimum of the WGRPP or PVGRPP described above and the HSL value as reflected in the QSE’s COP, at the time of the RUC execution. 
(3)	In calculating the amount short for each QSE, the QSE must be given a capacity credit for non-Intermittent Renewable Resources (IRRs) that were given notice of decommitment within the two hours before the Operating Hour as a result of the RUC process by setting the RCAPSNAP and RCAPADJ variables used below set equal to the RCAPSNAP value for the Resource immediately before the decommitment instruction was given.
(4)	In calculating the short amount for each QSE, if the RCAPSNAP for a non-IRR was credited to the QSE during the RUC Snapshot but the Resource experiences a Forced Outage within two hours before the start of the Settlement Interval, then the RCAPSNAP for that Resource is also credited to the QSE in the RCAPADJ.
(5)	In calculating the short amount for each QSE, if the DCIMPSNAP was credited to the QSE during the RUC Snapshot but the entire Direct Current Tie (DC Tie) experiences a Forced Outage within two hours before the start of the Settlement Interval, then the DCIMPSNAP is also credited to the QSE in the RTDCIMP.
(6)	For Combined Cycle Generation Resources, if more than one Combined Cycle Generation Resource is shown On-Line in its COP for the same Settlement hour, then the provisions of paragraph (6)(a) of Section 3.9.1, Current Operating Plan (COP) Criteria, apply in the determination of the On-Line Combined Cycle Generation Resource for that Settlement hour.
(7)	The QSE Ancillary Service shortfall calculation in MW for each hour in the RUC Snapshot or for the end of the Adjustment Period involves solving an optimization that minimizes any potential Ancillary Service shortfall for a QSE.   This is done by determining the optimal utilization of Ancillary Service capabilities within each QSE’s portfolio of Resources to meet its net Ancillary Service position for each Ancillary Service sub-type.  A QSE’s Ancillary Service shortfall for an hour is the difference between the QSE’s net Ancillary Service position and its coverage of Ancillary Services using the outputs of this optimization based on the QSE’s Resource Ancillary Service capabilities for that hour as reflected in the COPs submitted by the QSE.
(a)	For each Ancillary Service sub-type, the Ancillary Service MW capability for each Resource in the QSE’s portfolio for a given hour in the RUC Snapshot or at the end of the Adjustment Period (ASMWCAPSNAP and ASMWCAPADJ) is calculated as the minimum of:
(i)	HSL minus LSL in the COP if the Resource is On-Line (ON, ONOS, ONSC, and ONL).  If a Generation Resource COP Resource Status is OFF or OFFQS, only the COP HSL is used.  For a Combined Cycle Train, the Resource refers to a particular Combined Cycle Generation Resource belonging to that Combined Cycle Train.  For a Combined Cycle Train, select the Combined Cycle Generation Resource that is On-Line (ON or ONOS) with the highest HSL.  If none of the Combined Cycle Generation Resources of a Combined Cycle Train are On-Line, then select the Combined Cycle Generation Resource that has the highest HSL and a COP Resource Status of OFF and that can be started up within 30 minutes;
(ii)	Submitted Ancillary Service Offer MW quantity for the Ancillary Service type/sub-type;
(iii)	Submitted COP Ancillary Service MW capability; and
(iv)	Qualified Ancillary Service MW amount for the Ancillary Service sub-type.  For Resources with COP Resource Status of OFFQS, the qualified MW amounts for Reg-Up, Reg-Down, and RRS will be set to zero.  For Resources with a COP Resource Status of OFF, the qualified MW amounts for Reg-Up, Reg-Down, RRS, and ECRS will be set to zero.
(b)	The QSE Ancillary Service shortfall calculation enforces the following constraints for each hour using data from the RUC Snapshot or the end of the Adjustment Period:
(i)	Ensure that a QSE’s portfolio of Resource capacities are only used to cover that QSE’s net Ancillary Service position by each Ancillary Service sub-type.
(ii)	A QSE’s Fast Frequency Response Service (FFRS) position can be covered by the QSE’s portfolio of Energy Storage Resources (ESRs) qualified to provide FFRS, Load Resources having a high-set under-frequency Relay that are qualified for Responsive Reserve (RRS) or Controllable Load Resources (CLRs), Generation Resources, and ESRs that are qualified to provide RRS as Primary Frequency Response.
(iii)	A QSE’s RRS position of the type provided by Load Resources having a high-set under-frequency Relay that are qualified for RRS can be covered by the QSE’s portfolio of Load Resources qualified to provide this type of RRS or CLRs, Generation Resources, and ESRs that are qualified to provide RRS as Primary Frequency Response.
(iv)	A QSE’s ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service (ECRS) position of the type that is not SCED-dispatchable can be covered by the QSE’s portfolio of Load Resources that are qualified to provide non-SCED dispatchable ECRS, or by CLRs, Generation Resources, and ESRs that are qualified to provide ECRS of the type that is SCED-dispatchable.
(v)	A QSE’s Non-Spinning Reserve (Non-Spin) position of the type that is not SCED-dispatchable can be covered by the QSE’s portfolios of Load Resources that are qualified to provide non-SCED dispatchable Non-Spin, or by CLRs, Generation Resources, and ESRs that are qualified to provide Non-Spin of the type that is SCED-dispatchable.
(vi)	For each Resource and Ancillary Service sub-type:
(A)	Ancillary Service capacity used for each Ancillary Service sub-type cannot exceed that Resource’s Ancillary Service capability for that Ancillary Service sub-type.
(B)	The sum of all the Ancillary Service capacities used for each Ancillary Service sub-type cannot exceed the COP HSL minus LSL limits.  For Generation Resources that have a Resource Status of OFF and the Ancillary Service type is Non-Spin, consider LSL to be zero.  Likewise, for Generation Resources that have a Resource Status of OFFQS and the Ancillary Service type is Non-Spin or ECRS, consider LSL to be zero.
(C)	For ESRs, consider:
(1)	Duration requirements for each Ancillary Service type and the submitted COP values for Hour Beginning Planned State of Charge (SOC), Minimum SOC (MinSOC) and Maximum SOC (MaxSOC); 
(2)	Ancillary Service deployment factors, duration requirements for different Ancillary Service types or sub-types, and the difference between the submitted COP Hour Beginning Planned SOC for the hour under consideration and the next hour; and
(3)	The charge or discharge MW required to satisfy the above constraints. 
(c)	The outputs of the optimization for each Resource are: 
(i)	The Resource’s MW capacity used to cover its QSE’s net Ancillary Service position by Ancillary Service sub-type for a given hour.  These values are ASMWCAPUSNAP for a given hour in the RUC Snapshot and ASMWCAPUADJ for the end of the Adjustment Period.

Transmission Security Analysis and Reliability Unit Commitment 
5.1	Introduction
(1)	Transmission security analysis and Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) are used to ensure ERCOT System reliability and to ensure that enough Resource capacity, in addition to Ancillary Service capacity, is committed in the right locations to reliably serve the forecasted Load on the ERCOT System including Direct Current Tie (DC Tie) Load that has not been curtailed. 
[NPRR1009:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]
(1)	Transmission security analysis and Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) are used to ensure ERCOT System reliability and to ensure that enough Resource capacity and qualified Ancillary Service capacity are committed in the right locations to reliably serve the forecasted Load and Ancillary Service needs on the ERCOT System including Direct Current Tie (DC Tie) Load that has not been curtailed.
(2)	ERCOT shall conduct at least one Day-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (DRUC) and at least one Hourly Reliability Unit Commitment (HRUC) before each hour of the Operating Day.  ERCOT, in its sole discretion, may conduct a RUC at any time to evaluate and resolve reliability issues.
(3)	The DRUC must be run after the close of the Day-Ahead Market (DAM). 
(4)	The DRUC uses Three-Part Supply Offers, capped at the maximum of generic or verifiable minimum energy and Startup Costs, submitted before the DAM by Qualified Scheduling Entities (QSEs) that were considered in the DAM but not awarded in the DAM.  A QSE may not submit a Three-Part Supply Offer to be considered in the DRUC unless the offer was also submitted for consideration in the DAM.
(5)	ERCOT must initiate the HRUC process at least one hour before the Operating Hour to fine-tune the Resource commitments using updated Load forecasts and updated Outage information. 
(6)	The RUC Study Period for DRUC is the next Operating Day.  The RUC Study Period for HRUC is the balance of the current Operating Day plus the next Operating Day if the DRUC for the Operating Day has been solved. 
(7)	HRUC may decommit Resources only to maintain the reliability of the ERCOT System. 
(8)	For each RUC Study Period, the RUC considers capacity requirements for each hour of the RUC Study Period with the objective of minimizing costs based on logic described in Section 5.5.2, Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) Process.
(9)	The calculated Resource commitments arising from each RUC process, and a list of Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less, must be reviewed by ERCOT before issuing Dispatch Instructions to QSEs to commit, extend, or decommit Resources.
(10)	The Security Sequence is a set of prerequisite processes for RUC that describes the key system components and inputs that are required to support the RUC process, the RUC process itself, and the ERCOT review of the Resource commitment recommendations made by the RUC process. 
(11)	The RUC process may not be used to buy Ancillary Service unless the Ancillary Service Offers submitted in the DAM are insufficient to meet the requirements of the Ancillary Service Plan.  
[NPRR1009:  Delete paragraph (11) above upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project and renumber accordingly.]
(12)	After the use of market processes to the fullest extent practicable without jeopardizing the reliability of the ERCOT System, any ERCOT Dispatch Instructions for additional capacity that order a QSE to commit a specific Generation Resource to be On-Line shall be considered a RUC Dispatch for the purpose of the Settlement of payments and charges related to the committed Generation Resource.  An Operating Condition Notice (OCN), Advisory, Watch, or Emergency Notice requesting the available capacity of any currently available Generation Resources but not naming specific Generation Resources is not considered a RUC Dispatch for purposes of Settlement.
(13)	ERCOT shall post on the Market Information System (MIS) Certified Area, for each Off-Line Generation Resource that may be selected by an HRUC process, the current time since the Generation Resource last went Off-Line (in hours) and the corresponding start-up times ERCOT is using for each such Off-Line Generation Resource.  The time since the Generation Resource last went Off-Line and start-up times shall be updated at least hourly.
(14)	Prior to 1330 in the Day-Ahead, ERCOT may issue a Weekly Reliability Unit Commitment (WRUC) Verbal Dispatch Instruction (VDI) to inform a QSE that a Resource is required to be On-Line for all or part of a future Operating Day.  Following the receipt of a WRUC: 
(a)	The QSE may self-commit the Resource for the WRUC-instructed hours by updating the Resource’s Current Operating Plan (COP) to reflect the appropriate On-Line Resource Status for the WRUC-instructed hours prior to the DRUC process execution for the associated Operating Day.  Resources that have been self-committed by a QSE in accordance with a WRUC:
(i)	May have a Three-Part Supply Offer submitted into the DAM, and any of the WRUC-instructed hours in which the Three-Part Supply Offer is awarded in the DAM become DAM-Committed Intervals for the Resource and are settled accordingly; and
(ii)	Will not be issued a RUC commitment for the WRUC-instructed hours that were self-committed or DAM-committed.
(b)	ERCOT will commit the Resource as part of the DRUC process for the relevant Operating Day for all WRUC-instructed hours not DAM-committed or QSE self-committed.  For all purposes, including RUC Settlement, the Resource will be considered as committed by the DRUC for these hours.
(15)	If ERCOT issues an Outage Schedule Adjustment (OSA) pursuant to Section 3.1.4.6, Outage Coordination of Potential Transmission Emergency Conditions, or Section 3.1.6.9, Withdrawal of Approval and Rescheduling of Approved Planned Outages of Resource Facilities, QSEs with Resources that received an OSA shall be made whole to their actual costs incurred due to delaying or canceling and rescheduling the Outage as described in Section 5.6.5.1, Make-Whole Payment for Canceled or Delayed Outages for OSAs.
5.2	Reliability Unit Commitment Timeline Summary 
5.2.1	RUC Normal Timeline Summary
(1)	The following Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) Timeline Summary describes the normal timeline for RUC activities that occur in the Day-Ahead and Adjustment Periods.




 

 
5.2.2	RUC Process Timing Deviations
5.2.2.1	RUC Process Timeline After a Delay of the Day-Ahead Market
(1)	If the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) execution is delayed in accordance with Section 4.1.2, Day-Ahead Process and Timing Deviations, ERCOT shall conduct a Day-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (DRUC) after 1430 in the Day-Ahead and no earlier than one hour following the posting of DAM awards information on the ERCOT website as set forth in Section 4.5.3, Communicating DAM Results.  In this event, ERCOT will use the Current Operating Plan (COP) and Trades Snapshot taken just prior to the execution of the DRUC to settle RUC charges.
[NPRR1009:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]
(1)	If the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) execution is delayed in accordance with Section 4.1.2, Day-Ahead Process and Timing Deviations, ERCOT shall conduct a Day-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (DRUC) after 1430 in the Day-Ahead and no earlier than one hour following the posting of DAM awards information on the ERCOT website as set forth in Section 4.5.3, Communicating DAM Results.  In this event, ERCOT will use the RUC Snapshot taken just prior to the execution of the DRUC to settle RUC charges.

(1)	If ERCOT aborts all or part of the Day-Ahead process in accordance with Section 4.1.2, Day-Ahead Process and Timing Deviations, for any reason not due to a Market Suspension, then ERCOT shall use the following Supplemental Ancillary Services Market (SASM) process to purchase Ancillary Services for the next Operating Day and the Hourly Reliability Unit Commitment (HRUC) process described in this Section in lieu of the DRUC process.  If ERCOT aborts the Day-Ahead process due to a Market Suspension, it shall act in accordance with Section 25.3, Market Restart Processes.
(2)	When the DAM is aborted, ERCOT shall include in the Watch notification required by paragraph (2) of Section 4.1.2 the time when it intends to conduct the SASM described in this Section 5.2.2.2 to procure the amounts of Ancillary Services necessary to meet the Ancillary Service Plan for the Operating Day affected by the aborted DAM.  ERCOT shall allow at least one hour between the issuance of the Watch and the beginning of this SASM.
(3)	After the issuance of the Watch described in paragraph (2) above and prior to the beginning of this SASM, a Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) may cancel unexpired Ancillary Service Offers that were submitted for the aborted DAM.
(4)	A QSE may submit Ancillary Service Offers for this SASM after the issuance of the Watch described in paragraph (2) above and prior to the beginning of this SASM.
(5)	For this SASM, the QSE must submit the Self-Arranged Ancillary Service Quantity for the next Operating Day in accordance with the timeline described in paragraph (3) of Section 6.4.9.2, Supplemental Ancillary Services Market.  This amount may be different from the self-arrangement amounts previously submitted for the aborted DAM.
(6)	The amount of each Ancillary Service to be procured by ERCOT in this SASM is the amount of each Ancillary Service specified in the ERCOT Ancillary Service Plan posted prior to the aborted DAM less the total amount of each Ancillary Service in the QSE submittals for self-arranged Ancillary Services for this SASM.
(7)	This SASM will settle in accordance with Section 6.7, Real-Time Settlement Calculations for the Ancillary Services.
(8)	The SASM process for acquiring Ancillary Services in the event of an aborted Day-Ahead process shall be conducted in accordance with Section 6.4.9.2.2, SASM Clearing Process, but shall use the following activities and timeline as specified in paragraph (3) of Section 6.4.9.2, with time “X” being the time specified by ERCOT for the beginning of the SASM process in the Watch notification described above.
(9)	As soon as practicable, but no later than the time specified in paragraph (3) of Section 6.4.9.2, ERCOT shall notify each QSE of its awarded Ancillary Service Offer quantities, specifying Resource, Ancillary Service type, SASM Market Clearing Price for Capacity (MCPC), and the first and last hours of the awarded offer.
(10)	As soon as practicable, but no later than the time specified in paragraph (3) of Section 6.4.9.2, ERCOT shall post on the ERCOT website the hourly:
(a)	SASM MCPC for each type of Ancillary Service for each hour;
(b)	Total Ancillary Service procured in MW by Ancillary Service type for each hour; and
(c)	Aggregated Ancillary Service Offer Curve for each Ancillary Service for each hour.
(11)	No sooner than 1800 in the Day-Ahead and after the completion of the SASM process described in this Section 5.2.2.2, ERCOT shall execute an HRUC process. 
(a)	The RUC Study Period for this HRUC process is the balance of the current Operating Day plus the next Operating Day.  This HRUC process may be a post-1800 HRUC for the current Operating Day.
(b)	The COP and Trades Snapshot taken just prior to the execution of the HRUC process described in this Section 5.2.2.2 will be used to settle RUC charges in the Operating Day affected by the aborted DAM.
(c)	This HRUC process described in this Section 5.2.2.2 may commit Resources to supply Ancillary Services if the Ancillary Service Offers submitted in the SASM described in this Section 5.2.2.2 are insufficient to meet the requirements of the Ancillary Services Plan in the Operating Day affected by the aborted DAM.
(d)	A QSE may request cancellation of a RUC instruction to supply Ancillary Services if the Resource requested is not capable of providing the Ancillary Services due to equipment issues that are the result of non-frequency responsive power augmentation or other Resource control issues.  If ERCOT accepts the cancellation, ERCOT may require QSEs to submit supporting information describing the Resource control issues.
[NPRR1009:  Replace Section 5.2.2.2 above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]
5.2.2.2	RUC Process Timeline After an Aborted Day-Ahead Market
(1)	If ERCOT aborts all or part of the Day-Ahead process in accordance with Section 4.1.2, Day-Ahead Process and Timing Deviations, for any reason not due to a Market Suspension, then ERCOT shall use the Hourly Reliability Unit Commitment (HRUC) process described in this Section in lieu of the DRUC process.

5.5	Security Sequence, Including RUC
5.5.1	Security Sequence
(1)	The figure below highlights the key computational modules and processes that are used in the Security Sequence:
 
(2)	The Security Sequence uses computational modules functionally similar to those used in Real-Time Sequence, however, the inputs into the Security Sequence are based on a snapshot of projected hourly system conditions and constraints rather than Real-Time data.   
(3)	The Security Sequence uses the status of all transmission breakers and switches (current status for the first hour and normal status for all other hours of Hourly Reliability Unit Commitment (HRUC) and normal status for all hours of Day-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (DRUC)), updated for approved Planned Outages for equipment out of service and returned to service for building a representation of the ERCOT Transmission Grid for each hour of the Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) Study Period.  The Network Topology Processor constructs a network model for each hour that must be used by the Bus Load Forecast to estimate the hourly Load for each transmission bus.    
(4)	The weather forecast obtained by ERCOT must be provided to the Dynamic Rating Processor to create weather-adjusted MVA limits for each hour of the RUC Study Period for all transmission lines and transformers that have Dynamic Ratings.
(5)	ERCOT shall analyze base configuration, select n-1 contingencies and select n-2 contingencies under the Operating Guides.  The Operating Guides must also specify the criteria by which ERCOT may remove contingencies from the list.  ERCOT shall post to the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area the standard contingency list, including identification of changes from previous versions before being used in the Security Sequence.  ERCOT shall evaluate the need for Resource-specific deployments during Real-Time operations for management of congestion consistent with the Operating Guides.
(6)	ERCOT shall also post to the MIS Secure Area any contingencies temporarily removed from the standard contingency list by ERCOT immediately after successful execution of the Security Sequence.  ERCOT shall include the reason for removal of any contingency as soon as practicable but not later than one hour after removal. 
(7)	As part of the Network Security Analysis (NSA), for each hour of the RUC Study Period, ERCOT shall analyze all selected contingencies and perform the following:
(a)	Perform full AC analysis of all contingencies;
(b)	Monitor element and bus voltage limit violations; and
(c)	Monitor transmission line and transformer security violations. 
(8)	As part of the NSA, if there is an approved Remedial Action Plan (RAP) available, it must be used before considering a Resource commitment.
(9)	ERCOT shall review all security violations prior to RUC execution.  
(10)	All Remedial Action Schemes (RASs), Automatic Mitigation Plans (AMPs) and RAPs modeled in the Network Operations Model shall be included in the contingency analysis.  The computational modules must enable ERCOT to analyze contingencies, including the effects of all RASs and AMPs included in the Network Operations Model. 
(11)	ERCOT may deselect certain contingencies known to cause errors or that otherwise result in inconclusive study output in the RUC.  On continued de-selection of contingencies, ERCOT shall prepare an analysis to determine the cause of the error.  ERCOT may use information from the Day-Ahead processes as decision support during the Hour-Ahead processes.  ERCOT shall post to the MIS Secure Area any contingencies deselected by ERCOT and must include the reason for removal as soon as practicable, but not later than one hour after deselection.

5.5.2	Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) Process
(1)	The RUC process recommends commitment of Generation Resources, to match ERCOT’s forecasted Load including Direct Current Tie (DC Tie) Schedules, subject to all transmission constraints and Resource performance characteristics.  The RUC process takes into account Resources already committed in the Current Operating Plans (COPs), Resources already committed in previous RUCs, Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less, and Resource capacity already committed to provide Ancillary Service.  The formulation of the RUC objective function must employ penalty factors on violations of security constraints.  The objective of the RUC process is to minimize costs based on the Resource costs described in paragraphs (5) through (9) below.  For all hours of the RUC Study Period within the RUC process, Quick Start Generation Resources (QSGRs) with a COP Resource Status of OFFQS shall be considered as On-Line with Low Sustained Limit (LSL) at zero MW.  QSGRs with a Resource Status of OFFQS shall only be committed by ERCOT through a RUC instruction in instances when a reliability issue would not otherwise be managed through Dispatch Instructions from Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED).
