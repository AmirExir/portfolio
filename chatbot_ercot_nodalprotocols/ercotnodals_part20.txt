 limit specified above.
(B)	If an ERS Resource is contracted to provide services under a Must-Run Alternative (MRA) Agreement and has an ERS obligation during an overlapping ERS Standard Contract Term, ERCOT may conduct additional testing to verify the site’s ability to provide both services on the same or consecutive days.  Such testing may be conducted without regard to the 330 day limit specified above and without regard to any recovery periods allowed for either ERS or the MRA Agreement.
(C)	If a single TDSP-metered Premise has more than one ERS site and those ERS sites participate in different ERS Resources, then all of those ERS Resources will be subject to testing if any one of the ERS Resources is subject to testing.
(b)	Testing will be considered void and would require re-testing for any non-weather-sensitive Resources if one or more sites of an ERS Resource were disabled or unverifiable due to events on the TDSP side of the meter affecting the supply, delivery or measurement of electricity either during the event or prior that impacts the creation of a credible baseline.  QSEs must provide verification of such events from the TDSP or MRE.
(c)	For Weather-Sensitive ERS Resources, ERCOT shall conduct unannounced testing of each Weather-Sensitive ERS Load at least once but no more than twice per month of obligation during an ERS Standard Contract Term, unless testing has been superseded by deployment events as described in paragraph (vii) below.
(i)	The tests will be conducted according to normal ERS testing procedures.
(ii)	At the time of Dispatch during a test, ERCOT will not advise the QSE of the test duration, which may vary from one full 15-minute interval to 12 full 15-minute intervals.
(iii)	ERCOT may conduct a test during any of a Weather-Sensitive ERS Load’s obligated hours.  However, tests will generally be targeted toward periods of peak weather conditions. 
(iv)	For a Weather-Sensitive ERS Load assigned to the control group baseline, for each test ERCOT will designate a single group which shall be removed from the test population that will serve as the control group.
(v)	ERCOT shall calculate a test performance factor for each test of a Weather-Sensitive ERS Load using the event performance methodology described in Section 8.1.3.1.4.
(vi)	The QSE is responsible for managing group assignments and for deploying only the sites dispatched by ERCOT during a test.
(vii)	ERCOT may reduce the number of tests administered by the number of deployment events during the ERS Standard Contract Term. 
(viii)	The test performance factors for Weather-Sensitive ERS Resources shall always be set to one for use in Settlement for the ERS Standard Contract Term.
(ix)	Testing will be considered void for any weather-sensitive Resources if 10% or more sites of a weather-sensitive Resource were disabled or unverifiable due to events on the TDSP side of the meter affecting the supply, delivery or measurement of electricity either during the event or prior that impacts the creation of a credible baseline.  QSEs must provide verification of such events from the TDSP or MRE.
(2)	ERCOT shall conduct an unannounced test of an ERS Resource that has been suspended from participation in ERS pursuant to Section 8.1.3.3.  ERCOT will conduct such a test only after the QSE representing the ERS Resource has communicated to ERCOT a request for reinstatement of the suspended ERS Resource.
(3)	An ERCOT unannounced test of an ERS Generator must demonstrate injection of energy to the ERCOT System.  The use of Load banks is prohibited for ERCOT unannounced tests.
(4)	If an ERS Generator is co-located with an ERS Load as specified in Section 8.1.3.1.2, Performance Evaluation for Emergency Response Service Generators, ERCOT shall test both such ERS Resources simultaneously and the following shall apply:
(a)	Test performance of the ERS Load and the ERS Generator shall be evaluated jointly and attributed to both if the ERS Load is assigned to a default baseline or is assigned to the alternate baseline and the QSE elected for joint evaluation at the beginning of the ERS Standard Contract Term.
(b)	Test performance of the ERS Load and the ERS Generator shall be evaluated separately if the ERS Load is assigned to the alternate baseline and the QSE elected for separate evaluation at the beginning of the ERS Standard Contract Term.  If the separately evaluated ERS Load has no obligation greater than 100 kW in any ERS Time Period and does not meet the criteria for a successful test as defined in item (1)(a)(ii) above, the following shall apply:
(i)	If the interval data measured by the metering on the output of the generator(s) meets the criteria for a successful test as defined in item (1)(a)(ii) above, for the combined obligation of the ERS Load and the ERS Generator, then both the ERS Load and the ERS Generator will be deemed to have performed successfully for that ERS test.
(ii)	Otherwise, the ERS Load will be considered to have not performed successfully for that ERS test.
(5)	In order to assist QSEs and ERS Resources in managing environmental compliance, ERCOT shall limit the cumulative duration of Sustained Response Periods of testing of an ERS Resource to a maximum of one hour per ERS Standard Contract Term unless otherwise required to conduct re-testing.
(6)	Notwithstanding paragraph (5) above, Weather-Sensitive ERS Resources shall be subject to testing as described in paragraph (1)(c) above.
8.1.3.3	Payment Reductions and Suspension of Qualification of Emergency Response Service Resources and/or their Qualified Scheduling Entities
8.1.3.3.1	Suspension of Qualification of Non-Weather-Sensitive Emergency Response Service Resources and/or their Qualified Scheduling Entities
(1)	If a QSE’s portfolio-level availability factor and event performance factors as calculated in Section 8.1.3.3.3, Performance Criteria for Qualified Scheduling Entities Representing Non Weather-Sensitive Emergency Response Service Resources, both equal or exceed 0.95, the QSE will be deemed to have met its ERS performance requirements for the ERS Contract Period, and the QSE and its ERS Resources are not subject to suspension.
(2)	If a QSE fails to meet its portfolio-level availability and/or event performance requirements as described in Section 8.1.3.3.3, ERCOT shall take the following actions:
(a)	If a QSE failure is based only on event performance failure and ERS Resources that comprise 95% or more of the QSE’s obligation for each of the events in the ERS Contract Term are deemed to have met their obligations, the QSE shall be deemed to have met its event performance requirements for the ERS Contract Term; otherwise
(b)	ERCOT may suspend the QSE from participation in ERS, and the QSE may be subject to administrative penalties imposed by the PUCT.  ERCOT may consider mitigating factors such as equipment failures and Force Majeure Events in determining whether to suspend the QSE.
(3)	If a QSE’s portfolio-level availability factor is less than 0.95 excluding the intervals for Resources that had one or more sites of an ERS Resource disabled or unverifiable due to events on the TDSP side of the meter affecting the supply, delivery or measurement of electricity either during the event or prior that impacts the creation of a credible baseline, ERS Resources in that portfolio that were not disabled or unverifiable due to events on the TDSP side of the meter affecting the supply, delivery or measurement of electricity either during the event or prior that impacts the creation of a credible baseline shall be subject to the following: 
(a)	If an ERS Resource in the QSE’s portfolio achieves an availability factor of 0.85 or greater, the ERS Resource shall not be subject to a reduction of its availability factor; 
(b)	If an ERS Resource achieves an ERSAFCOMB less than 0.85 for an ERS Standard Contract Term consisting of a single ERS Contract Period, or achieves an ERSAFCOMB lower than the threshold specified in paragraph (4)(d) of Section 8.1.3.1.3.3, Contract Period Availability Calculations for Emergency Response Service Resources, for an ERS Contract Period with a duration that is less than an ERS Standard Contract Term, then the ERS Resource’s availability factor shall be squared; and
(c)	If the availability factor for one or more ERS Resources is squared pursuant to paragraph (b) above, ERCOT shall compute the QSE’s final portfolio-level availability factor using that modified availability factor. 
(4)	ERCOT shall calculate a QSE’s portfolio-level event performance factor and interval performance factor for the first full interval of that event. The portfolio for this purpose shall consist of ERS Resources that did not have any sites that were disabled or unverifiable due to events on the TDSP side of the meter affecting the supply, delivery or measurement of electricity either during the event or prior that impacts the creation of a credible baseline. If either the portfolio-level event performance factor or the interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period is less than 0.95, ERCOT shall determine final event performance factors for ERS Resources in the portfolio as follows: 
(a)	If an ERS Load in the QSE’s portfolio is not co-located with an ERS Generator or is evaluated separately, as specified in Section 8.1.3.1.2, Performance Evaluation for Emergency Response Service Generators, the final event performance factor for the ERS Load shall be determined as follows:
(i)	If the ERS Load achieves an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of 0.95 or greater, the final event performance factor shall be set equal to the original event performance factor.
(ii)	If the ERS Load achieves an event performance factor of less than 0.95 and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of 0.95 or greater, the baseline for that ERS Load shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final event performance factor being equal to the square of its original event performance factor.
(iii)	If the ERS Load achieves an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of less than 0.95, the baseline for that ERS Resource shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times its original event performance factor.
(iv)	If the ERS Load achieves an event performance factor of less than 0.95 and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of less than 0.95, the baseline for that ERS Resource shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times the square of its original event performance factor.
(b)	If an ERS Generator in the QSE’s portfolio, is not co-located with an ERS Load, the final event performance factor for the ERS Generator shall be determined as follows:
(i)	If the ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of 0.95 or greater, the final event performance factor shall be set equal to original event performance factor.
(ii)	If the ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of less than 0.95 and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of 0.95 or greater, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System by the ERS Generator for each interval of the event shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final event performance factor being equal to the square of its original event performance factor.
(iii)	If the ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of less than 0.95, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System by the ERS Generator for each interval of the event shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times its original event performance factor.
(iv)	If the ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of less than 0.95 and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of less than 0.95, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System by the ERS Generator for each interval of the event shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times the square of its original event performance factor.
(c)	If an ERS Generator in the QSE’s portfolio, is co-located with an ERS Load and is evaluated separately, as specified in Section 8.1.3.1.2, the final event performance factor for the ERS Generator shall be determined as follows:
(i)	If the ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of 0.95 or greater, the final event performance factor shall be set equal to original event performance factor.
(ii)	If the ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of less than 0.95 and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of 0.95 or greater, the energy output by the ERS Generator for each interval of the event shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final event performance factor being equal to the square of its original event performance factor.
(iii)	If the ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of less than 0.95, the energy output by the ERS Generator for each interval of the event shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times its original event performance factor.
(iv)	If the ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of less than 0.95 and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of less than 0.95, the energy output by the ERS Generator for each interval of the event shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times the square of its original event performance factor.
(d)	If an ERS Load and an ERS Generator in a QSE’s portfolio, are co-located and are evaluated jointly, as specified in Section 8.1.3.1.2, the final event performance factor shall be determined as follows:
(i)	If the combined performance of the ERS Load and ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of 0.95 or greater, the final event performance factor for both ERS Resources shall be set equal to original event performance factor.
(ii)	If the combined performance of the ERS Load and ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of less than 0.95 and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of 0.95 or greater, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System by the ERS Generator for each interval of the event shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final combined event performance factor being equal to the square of its original combined event performance factor.  If a reduction factor of zero results in the combined event performance factor being greater than the square of the original combined event performance factor, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System shall be set to zero for all intervals in the event and the baseline for the ERS Load shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final combined event performance factor being equal to the square of the original combined event performance factor.
(iii)	If the combined performance of the ERS Load and ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of less than 0.95, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System by the ERS Generator for each interval of the event shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final combined event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times its original event performance factor.  If a reduction factor of zero results in the combined event performance factor being greater than 0.75 times its original event performance factor, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System shall be set to zero for all intervals in the event and the baseline for the ERS Load shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final combined event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times its original event performance factor.
(iv)	If the combined performance of the ERS Load and ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of less than 0.95 and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of less than 0.95, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System by the ERS Generator for each interval of the event shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final combined event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times the square of its original event performance factor.  If a reduction factor of zero results in the combined event performance factor being greater than 0.75 times the square of its original event performance factor, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System shall be set to zero for all intervals in the event and the baseline for the ERS Load shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final combined event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times the square of its original event performance factor.
(e)	If the final event performance factor for one or more ERS Resources in a QSE’s portfolio is reduced pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (d) above, ERCOT shall re-compute the QSE’s final portfolio-level event performance factor using each ERS Resource’s final event performance factor. 
(5)	If an ERS Resource, in accordance with Section 8.1.3.2, Testing of Emergency Response Service Resources, has failed any two consecutive tests in an ERS Standard Contract Term, or has failed both the first test in an ERS Standard Contract Term and the most recent prior test occurring within 365 days of that first failed test, ERSTESTPF shall be set to the lower of 0.75 or the average of those two test performance factors and shall be used in calculating the payment to the QSE for the ERS Standard Contract Term during which the second failure occurred.  Otherwise, ERSTESTPF shall be set to 1.0.
(6)	Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (5) above, if an ERS Resource, in accordance with Section 8.1.3.2, has failed the most recent three consecutive tests within a 365 day period, then ERSTESTPF for the ERS Standard Contract Term in which the most recent failure has occurred, shall be determined as follows:
(a)	If the average of ERSTESTPF for those three tests is equal to 0.90 or greater, ERSTESTPF shall be set to 0.5.
(b)	If the average of ERSTESTPF for those three tests is less than 0.90, ERSTESTPF shall be set zero.
(c)	If the ERS Resource has failed the most recent four consecutive tests within a 365 day period, then ERSTESTPF for the ERS Standard Contract Term in which the most recent failure has occurred, shall be set to zero.
(7)	Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (5) and (6) above, if an ERS Resource, in accordance with Section 8.1.3.1.4, Event Performance Criteria for Emergency Response Service Resources, successfully deploys in all ERS deployment events in which the ERS Resource has an obligation during that ERS Standard Contract Term, ERSTESTPF shall be set to 1.0 for that ERS Standard Contract Term.
(8)	If a Governmental Authority issues a written determination that an ERS Resource is in violation of any environmental law that would preclude the ERS Resource’s compliance with its ERS availability or deployment obligations, ERCOT shall treat the ERS Resource as having no availability for the remainder of the Standard Contract Term following the Governmental Authority’s determination and shall treat the Resource as having an event performance factor of zero for any deployments in the remaining portion of the ERS Standard Contract Term.  ERCOT shall also suspend the ERS Resource’s participation in ERS until the ERS Resource’s QSE certifies to ERCOT in writing that the violation has been remedied and that the ERS Resource may lawfully participate in ERS.
(9)	If a QSE is suspended pursuant to paragraph (2) above, each of the QSE’s ERS Resources whose availability or event performance factors was reduced in accordance with paragraphs (3) or (4) above also shall be suspended, and each of the sites in those ERS Resources shall also be suspended.  The duration of the suspension for such ERS Resources and sites shall be one ERS Standard Contract Term.  ERCOT shall reject offers for ERS Resources that are suspended or that contain one or more suspended sites.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, ERCOT may choose not to suspend an ERS Resource if it determines that the reduced availability or event performance factor was attributable to the fault of its QSE or to one or more mitigating factors, such as equipment failures and Force Majeure Events.
(10)	The suspension of an ERS Resource or a QSE representing an ERS Resource shall begin on the day following the expiration of the current or most recent ERS obligation. 
(11)	ERCOT may reinstate an ERS Resource’s eligibility to offer into ERS upon the ERS Resource’s satisfactory completion of the reinstatement process, including a test conducted by ERCOT, as described in Section 8.1.3.2 and in the ERS technical requirements.
8.1.3.3.2	Payment Reduction and Suspension of Qualification of Weather-Sensitive Emergency Response Service Loads and/or their Qualified Scheduling Entities
(1)	If the QSE portfolio-level event performance factor for the QSE’s portfolio of Weather-Sensitive ERS Loads for the ERS Contract Period as calculated in Section 8.1.3.3.4, Performance Criteria for Qualified Scheduling Entities Representing Weather-Sensitive Emergency Response Service Loads, is greater than or equal to 0.90 or if 10% or more sites of an ERS Load were disabled or unverifiable due to events on the TDSP side of the meter affecting the supply, delivery or measurement of electricity either during the event or prior that impacts the creation of a credible baseline, ERCOT shall not impose a payment reduction for any of the those ERS Loads.  Otherwise, ERCOT shall compute QSE portfolio-level Demand reduction values for each test and event throughout the ERS Contract Period as the greater of zero or the portfolio-level baseline estimate for each interval less the portfolio-level actual Load for that interval.  The relationship of the Demand reduction values for each ERS Load to actual weather shall be modeled and used to derive a time-period specific Demand reduction value that would be realized under normalized peak weather conditions.  If the normalized peak Demand reduction value for each ERS Time Period, summed across all ERS Loads in the portfolio is greater than or equal to 90% of the QSE’s total offered MW capacity in that time period, ERCOT shall not impose a payment reduction for any of the ERS Loads in the portfolio.
(2)	For an ERS deployment event for a Weather-Sensitive ERS Load with three or more full intervals in the Sustained Response Period, if the ERS Load’s EIPF for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period is less than 75% of the average EIPF for the remaining full intervals of the Sustained Response Period, the baseline used to evaluate the ERS Load shall be reduced to the level at which the ERSEPF for that event or test is equal to 0.75 times the ERSEPF determined by using the initial baseline.
(3)	If the provisions of paragraph (1) above are not met, ERCOT shall reduce a QSE’s payment for Weather-Sensitive ERS Load as follows:
(a)	If the maximum number of sites in the ERS Load during the ERS Standard Contract Term is less than 80% of the number of sites projected by the QSE at the time of offer submission, as described in paragraph (15) of Section 3.14.3.1, Emergency Response Service Procurement, the baseline used to evaluate the Weather-Sensitive ERS Load shall be reduced to the level at which the ERSEPF is equal to the square of the ERSEPF determined by using the initial baseline. 
(b)	For all events occurring in an ERS Time Period, if, for that ERS Time Period the normalized peak Demand reduction value per site within the Weather-Sensitive ERS Load is less than 90% of the average Demand reduction value per site, based on the QSE’s offer for that ERS Time Period, and the ERS Load’s ERSEPF for an event in that ERS Time Period is less than 0.90, the baseline used to evaluate the ERS Load for that event shall be reduced to the level at which the ERS Load’s ERSEPF is equal to the square of the ERSEPF determined by using the initial baseline.
(c)	If either paragraph (3)(a) or (b) above require a payment reduction, but not both, and the normalized peak demand reduction for the resource is greater than or equal to 90% of the QSE’s offered MW capacity, no payment reduction for the event shall be imposed.
(d)	If the provisions of both paragraphs (3)(a) and (b) above require the ERSEPF to be squared, the baseline used to evaluate the ERS Load shall be reduced to the level at which the ERSEPF for the ERS Load is equal to the cube of the ERSEPF determined by using the initial baseline.
(e)	If an ERS Load’s obligation is exhausted during an ERS Contract Period, the provisions of paragraphs (3)(a), (b), and (c) above shall not apply.
(f)	Baseline reductions required pursuant to paragraphs (3)(a), (b), and (c) above shall be applied to the initial baseline calculated by ERCOT.  If a baseline reduction pursuant to paragraph (2) above also is required, that reduction shall be based on the adjusted baseline after applying the reductions provided for in paragraphs (3)(a), (b), and (c) above.
(g)	If the final event performance factor for one or more ERS Loads in a QSE’s portfolio of Weather-Sensitive ERS Loads is reduced pursuant to paragraphs (2) or (3)(a), (b), or (d) above, ERCOT shall re-compute the QSE’s final portfolio-level event performance factor using each ERS Load’s adjusted baselines.
8.1.3.3.3	Performance Criteria for Qualified Scheduling Entities Representing Non-Weather-Sensitive Emergency Response Service Resources
(1)	A QSE’s ERS performance will be evaluated based on its portfolio’s performance for each of the four ERS service types during ERS deployment events and on the overall availability of its portfolio in an ERS Standard Contract Term, as follows:
(a)	Availability:
(i)	ERCOT shall calculate a portfolio-level availability factor for each QSE’s ERS portfolio for each ERS service type for each ERS Time Period in an ERS Contract Period using the methodologies defined in Section 8.1.3.1.3, Availability Criteria for Emergency Response Service Resources, except that the availability factor for each ERS Time Period will be allowed to exceed 1.0.  ERCOT shall then calculate a single time- and capacity-weighted availability factor for the QSE portfolio for each ERS service type for the ERS Contract Period using the methodologies defined in Section 8.1.3.1.3.  
(ii)	ERCOT shall then calculate a single time and capacity-weighted availability factor for the QSE portfolio for the ERS Standard Contract Term and the ERS service type, which will be capped at 1.0.  
(A)	For an ERS Standard Contract Term with a single ERS Contract Period, the QSE portfolio-level availability factor for each ERS service type for the ERS Standard Contract Term shall be the portfolio-level availability factor for each ERS service type for the ERS Contract Period.  
(B)	For an ERS Standard Contract Term with multiple ERS Contract Periods, ERCOT shall compute a QSE portfolio-level availability factor for each ERS service type for the ERS Standard Contract Term by averaging the QSE’s availability factors across ERS Contract Periods and ERS Time Periods for each ERS service type, weighted according to time and capacity obligations.  
(iii)	The QSE’s portfolio-level availability factor for each ERS service type for the ERS Standard Contract Term will determine both the availability component of the ERS payment to the QSE and whether the QSE has met its ERS availability requirements.  If the QSE’s portfolio-level availability factor for each ERS service type for the ERS Standard Contract Term equals or exceeds 0.95, the QSE shall be deemed to have met its availability requirements for the ERS Standard Contract Term; otherwise, the QSE shall be deemed to have failed to meet this requirement.  If the QSE’s portfolio-level availability factor for either ERS service type for the ERS Standard Contract Term is less than 1.0, the QSE’s ERS capacity payment shall be reduced according to the formulas in Section 6.6.11.1, Emergency Response Service Capacity Payments.
(b)	Event Performance: 
(i)	QSEs representing ERS Resources must meet performance standards specified in Section 8.1.3.1.4, Event Performance Criteria for Emergency Response Service Resources, as applied on a portfolio-level basis.  ERCOT shall determine a QSE’s portfolio-level event performance for each ERS service type by calculating a QSE portfolio-level event performance factor for each ERS deployment event.  For purposes of evaluating ERS Loads, ERCOT shall establish a baseline representing the portfolio’s estimated Load, or, for DRG that has been designated by the QSE to be evaluated by using its native load, calculated 15-minute interval native load data in the absence of the ERS deployment event.  For purposes of evaluating ERS Generators, ERCOT shall compute portfolio-level injection of energy to the ERCOT System.  Using this data, ERCOT shall calculate a QSE portfolio-level event performance factor for each ERS deployment event for each ERS service type based on the weighted average of the event interval performance factors, weighted by the total obligation and IntFrac.  
(ii)	ERCOT shall then calculate an ERSEPFqrd for the ERS Standard Contract Term, which will be capped at 1.0.  For an ERS Standard Contract Term with no ERS deployment events, the ERSEPFqrd for the ERS Standard Contract Term shall be set to 1.0.  
(A)	For an ERS Standard Contract Term with a single ERS deployment event, the ERSEPFqrd for the ERS Standard Contract Term shall be the QSE portfolio-level event performance factor for the event.  
(B)	For an ERS Standard Contract Term with multiple ERS deployment events, ERCOT shall compute the ERSEPFqrd for the ERS Standard Contract Term by averaging the QSE portfolio-level interval performance factors for all of the deployment events for each ERS service type, weighted by the total obligation and IntFrac.  
(iii)	The ERSEPFqrd for an ERS Standard Contract Term will determine both the event performance component of the ERS payment to the QSE and whether the QSE has met its ERS event performance requirements for that ERS service type.  If an ERSEPFqrd for an ERS Standard Contract Term is greater than or equal to 0.95, the QSE will be deemed to have met its event performance requirements for the ERS Standard Contract Term for that ERS service type; otherwise, the QSE shall be deemed to have failed to meet this requirement.  If a QSE’s ERSEPFqrd is less than 1.0 for the Standard Contract Term, the QSE’s ERS capacity payment shall be reduced according to the formulas in Section 6.6.11.1.  For purposes of calculating an ERSEPFqrd, any ERS Resource that was not subject to Dispatch during the event shall be treated as having met its obligation.
(iv)	ERCOT will not include any Resources in the calculation of the ERSEPFqrd if one or more sites of an ERS Resource were disabled or unverifiable due to events on the TDSP side of the meter affecting the supply, delivery or measurement of electricity either during the event or prior that impacts the creation of a credible baseline.  QSEs must provide verification of such events from the TDSP or MRE.
(c)	Ten-minute Deployment:  Within ten minutes of the deployment time within the ERCOT Extensible Markup Language (XML) deployment message for ERS-10, a QSE shall ensure that each ERS Resource participating in ERS-10 in its portfolio deploys in accordance with its obligations.  For each ERS-10 deployment event, ERCOT shall assess each QSE’s compliance with this requirement by calculating a capacity-weighted QSE portfolio-level interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period, using the methodologies defined in Section 8.1.3.1.4.  
(d)	Thirty-minute Deployment:  Within 30 minutes of the deployment time within the ERCOT XML deployment message for ERS-30, a QSE shall ensure that each ERS Resource participating in its portfolio deploys in accordance with its obligations.  For each ERS-30 deployment event, ERCOT shall assess each QSE’s compliance with this requirement by calculating a capacity-weighted QSE portfolio-level interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period, using the methodologies defined in Section 8.1.3.1.4.
The above variables are defined as follows:
Variable	Unit	Description
ERSEPFqrd	None	ERS Event Performance Factor per QSE per ERS Standard Contract Term per ERS Service Type—Event performance factor for QSE q in ERS Standard Contract Term r and ERS service type d as calculated pursuant to Section 8.1.3.3.1.
q	None	A QSE.
r	None	ERS Standard Contract Term.
d	None	ERS service type (Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS-10 or Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS-30).
(2)	Failure by a QSE portfolio to meet its ERS event performance or availability requirements shall not be cause for revocation of the QSE’s Ancillary Services qualification. 
8.1.3.3.4	Performance Criteria for Qualified Scheduling Entities Representing Weather-Sensitive Emergency Response Service Loads 
(1)	A QSE’s ERS performance will be evaluated based on the performance of its portfolio of Weather-Sensitive ERS Loads during ERS deployment events in an ERS Standard Contract Term as follows:
(a)	ERCOT shall compute the following quantities at the QSE portfolio level for each interval of a deployment: MW obligation, baseline estimate and actual Demand as the sum of the respective quantities across the ERS Loads, or, for DRG that has been designated by the QSE to be evaluated by using its native load, calculated 15-minute interval native load data in the portfolio with obligations for that interval.  In addition, ERCOT shall compute the QSE’s portfolio-level prorated total obligations as the weighted sum of the obligations of the deployed ERS Loads weighted by the ratio the number of sites participating in the ERS Load during the event to the maximum number of sites projected by the QSE at the time of offer submission and the prorated interval fraction value (IntFrac) for each interval of a deployment as the average respectively of the interval fractions for each of the ERS Loads within its portfolio weighted by the ERS Load’s obligation for that interval multiplied by the ratio of the number of sites participating in the ERS Load during the event to the maximum number of sites projected by the QSE at the time of offer submission.
(b)	ERCOT shall compute the QSE’s portfolio-level event interval performance factor for each interval of a deployment as specified in Section 8.1.3.1.4, Event Performance Criteria for Emergency Response Service Resources, using the values computed in paragraph (a) above.
(c)	ERCOT shall compute the QSE’s portfolio-level Weather-Sensitive ERS Load event performance factor (ERSEPF) for each test and event as the weighted average of the event interval performance factors calculated in paragraph (b) above, weighted by the prorated obligation and interval fractions (IntFrac) computed in paragraph (a) above.
(d)	ERCOT shall compute the QSE’s portfolio-level Weather-Sensitive ERS Load event performance factor for the ERS Contract Period as the average of the event interval performance factors for all tests and events during the ERS Contract Period calculated in paragraph (b) above weighted by the prorated obligation and interval fractions computed in paragraph (a) above.

(4)	For any Settlement and billing disputes resolved prior to issuance of the RTM Final Statement, ERCOT shall effect the dispute’s resolution on the RTM Final Statement for that Operating Day.  If a dispute is submitted by 15 Business Days after the issuance of the RTM Initial Statement for an Operating Day and is not resolved on the RTM Final Statement, ERCOT will affect the dispute’s resolution on an RTM Resettlement Statement for that Operating Day.  ERCOT shall issue such an RTM Resettlement Statement within a reasonable time after resolving the Settlement and billing dispute.  
(5)	ERCOT must effect the resolution of any dispute submitted more than 15 Business Days after the issuance of the RTM Initial Statement on the next available Resettlement or RTM True-Up statement for that Operating Day.  For Settlement and billing disputes resolved under Section 9.14, Settlement and Billing Dispute Process, and submitted at least 20 Business Days before the scheduled date for issuance of the RTM True-Up Statement, ERCOT will include adjustments relating to the dispute on the RTM True-Up Statement.  Resolved disputes must be included on the next available Settlement Invoice after ERCOT has issued the RTM True-Up Statement.
(6)	ERCOT may not issue an RTM Resettlement Statement less than 20 days before a scheduled RTM Final Statement or RTM True-Up Statement for the relevant Operating Day.  An RTM Resettlement Statement will reflect differences to financial records generated on the previous Settlement Statement for the given Operating Day.
(7)	ERCOT may issue an RTM Resettlement Statement after the issuance of an RTM Final Statement in order to resolve approved disputes related to Section 5.6.5.2, RUC Make-Whole Payment and RUC Clawback Charge for Resources Receiving OSAs.
(8)	ERCOT may issue RTM Resettlement Statements after the timeline referenced in paragraph (2) above if directed by the ERCOT Board, the result of a resolution of an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) procedure, or under the procedure for Return of Settlement Funds.
(9)	If ERCOT is required to issue a Resettlement Statement per this Section, but resettlement is not practicable due to system limitations, ERCOT shall make the adjustments through a separate Invoice that is produced outside of normal Settlement Invoices.  The appropriate payments and charges, along with Settlement quality information, shall be supplied to all impacted Market Participants.  
9.5.7	Notice of Resettlement for the Real-Time Market
(1)	While maintaining confidentiality of all Market Participants, ERCOT shall send a Market Notice in conjunction with the resettlement, indicating the resettlement of a specific Operating Day and the date of issuance of the RTM Resettlement Statements.

(a)	Detailed description of reason(s) for resettlement;
(b)	Affected Operating Days;
(c)	Affected settlement Charge Types; and
(d)	Total resettled amount, by Charge Type.
9.5.8	RTM True-Up Statement
(1)	ERCOT shall use the best available Settlement data, as described in Section 9.5.2, Settlement Statements for the RTM, to produce an RTM True-Up Statement for each Statement Recipient for each given Operating Day.
(2)	ERCOT shall issue RTM True-Up Statements 180 days following the Operating Day, if ERCOT has received and validated usage data from at least 99% of the total number of Electric Service Identifiers (ESI IDs) with a BUSIDRRQ Load Profile Type code and if ERCOT has received and validated usage data from at least 90% of the total number of ESI IDs with a BUSIDRRQ Load Profile Type code from each Meter Reading Entity (MRE) representing at least 20 Interval Data Recorder (IDR) ESI IDs (IDR Meter Data Threshold).  If the above conditions have not been met, then ERCOT shall issue RTM True-Up Statements as soon as the IDR Meter data becomes available for that Operating Day.  If no RTM True-Up Statement has been issued 365 days after the Operating Day, then ERCOT shall issue a RTM True-Up Statement for that Operating Day.  If any RTM True-Up Statement issuance date does not fall on a Business Day, then the RTM True-Up Statement must be issued by the end of the next Business Day after the RTM True-Up Settlement date.
(3)	An RTM True-Up Statement will reflect differences to financial records generated on the previous Settlement Statement for the given Operating Day. 
9.5.9	Notice of True-Up Settlement Timeline Changes for the Real-Time Market
(1)	If the IDR Meter Data Threshold has not been met by the 180th day after the Operating Day (or, if the 180th day is not a Business Day, by the next day thereafter that is a Business Day), then ERCOT shall send a Market Notice about the delay of any RTM True-Up Statement issuance indicating the IDR Meter Data Threshold has not been met.
(2)	For any delayed RTM True-Up Statement, ERCOT shall send a Market Notice indicating that it will issue an RTM True-Up Statement for a specific Operating Day within two Business Days after discovering the delay.  As soon as practicable, ERCOT shall send a Market Notice with the revised date on which the delayed RTM True-Up Statement will be issued.
9.5.10	Confirmation for the Real-Time Market
(1)	It is the responsibility of each Statement Recipient to notify ERCOT if a Settlement Statement for the RTM is not available on the MIS Certified Area on the date specified for posting of that Settlement Statement in the Settlement Calendar.  Each Settlement Statement for the RTM is deemed to have been available on the posting date specified on the Settlement Calendar, unless it notifies ERCOT to the contrary.  If ERCOT receives notice that a Settlement Statement is not available, ERCOT shall make reasonable attempts to provide the Settlement Statement to the Statement Recipient, and ERCOT shall modify the Settlement and billing timeline accordingly for that Settlement Statement.  
9.5.11	Validation of the True-Up Statement for the Real-Time Market
(1)	The Statement Recipient is considered to have validated each RTM True-Up Statement unless it has filed a Settlement and billing dispute or reported an exception within ten Business Days after the RTM True-Up Statement has been posted on the MIS Certified Area.
