o	ERCOT produces a comparison file with inconsistencies between the newly produced MOD case with an effective date of the TP pull date and the new TP case.
o	ERCOT shall upload and commit the comparison file to MOD which synchronizes MOD with NMMS.
o	ERCOT shall submit a PMCR to remove temporary configurations created by any RAS or CMP
o	ERCOT shall update all SODGs with the latest information from NMMS.

•	SSWG Case Build:
o	Review existing PMCRs.
o	Submit/update PMCRs.
o	Submit/update Profiles.
o	Load generation dispatch.
o	Review generation voltage schedules and suggest changes.
o	Review generation reactive curves and suggest changes.
o	Interim final review and tuning.
o	SSWG approves cases.
o	Cases finalized by SSWG, the Case Information document, and the chan
