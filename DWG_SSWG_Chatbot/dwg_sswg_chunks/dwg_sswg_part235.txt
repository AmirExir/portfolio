comes available, ERCOT or the DWG member to whose system the equipment is connected shall recommend an interim solution to the missing or problematic data.
	Dynamic Data and Stability Book Storage
ERCOT shall make available to the DWG members in electronic format the dynamic data described in this document.  ERCOT shall maintain a repository of dynamic data approved by the DWG and will maintain the submitted revisions.
3.5	Dynamic Models for Distributed Generation
3.5.1 Distribution Generation Resource (DGR) and Distribution Energy Storage Resource (DESR) 
RE provided models will be used to represent inverter-based DGRs and DESRs. If the RE is not required to provide a model and/or an adequate model is not available to DWG, the DER_A model will be used. Parameterization will be based on DWG approved parameters in the ERCOT DWG DG Parameterization Guideline for the DER_A model and will represent capabilities consistent with the DGR/DESR requirements in the ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide.
