f relevant quantities for each test.  When submitting PSS/E and PSCAD MQT files, include the leading and lagging power factor cases for the voltage ride-through tests.  Guidelines on how these tests should be performed and the expected model performance are provided in the following sub-sections. All tests are required for PSS/E, TSAT, and PSCAD models with the exception of the Phase Angle Jump Test in Section 3.1.5.9, which is only required for PSCAD models.  A sample report is posted under ‘Model Quality Guide’ on the ERCOT Resource Entity webpage . Plots of PSS/E, TSAT, and PSCAD test results should be overlaid onto the same plot axis for comparison.  However, TSAT model testing is not required for models utilizing a TSAT standard library model.
