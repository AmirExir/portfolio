l Peak Average, derived from Settlement data, is first calculated as the average capacity during the 20 highest system-wide peak Load hours for a given year’s summer and winter Peak Load Seasons. The final value is the average of the previous ten eligible years of Seasonal Peak Average values. Eligible years include 2009 through the most recent year for which COP data is available for the summer and winter Peak Load Seasons.  If the number of eligible years is less than ten, the average shall be based on the number of eligible years available.  This calculation is limited to WGRs that have been in operation as of January 1 for each year of the period used for the calculation.
WINDCAP s, i, r	MW	Existing WGR Capacity—The capacity available for all existing WGRs for the summer and winter Peak Load Seasons s, year i, and region r, multiplied by WINDPEAKPCT for summer and winter Peak Load Seasons s and region r.
