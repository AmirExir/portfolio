ugh an assessment as per NERC standards.
Also, the TSP shall indicate any other schemes that are part of or impact the UVLS programs such as related generation protection, islanding schemes, automatic load restoration schemes, automatic capacitor/reactor switching, and RASs.  
The model shall contain the necessary information to properly represent the under voltage relay actions in a dynamic study, including:
	Location (bus number and/or load ID) of load to be interrupted.
	Fraction of load to be interrupted.
	Corresponding voltage set points.
	Overall scheme clearing times (including all time delays, breaker clearing times, etc.).
All UVLS data from the responsible entities will be documented in the annual Stability Book.
	Protective Relay Data
The operation of protection, control, and RAS systems can affect the dynamic performance of the ERCOT system during and following contingencies. Planning, documenting, maintaining, or other activities associated with these systems is outside th
