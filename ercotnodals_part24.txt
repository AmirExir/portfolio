15.1.6	Concurrent Processing
(1)	Concurrent processing permits multiple requests to proceed at the same time.  The purpose of concurrent processing is to assure all valid transactions are accepted and processed according to a set of market rules.  The order of precedence for initiating retail transactions is:
(a)	Move-In Requests;
(b)	Move-Out Requests; and
(c)	Switch Requests.
(2)	When performing concurrent processing checks, ERCOT will first perform standard validations to ensure the requests are valid.  This validation can be found in Section 15.1, Customer Switch of Competitive Retailer, Section 15.1.4, Beginning Service (New Construction Completed and Move Ins), and Section 15.1.5, Service Termination (Move Out).
15.1.6.1	Move In Date Prior to or After Move Out Date
(1)	ERCOT performs evaluations two Retail Business Days prior to all move in and move out scheduled meter read dates or upon the receipt of the TDSP response, whichever is later.  If the move in scheduled meter read date is not equal to the move out scheduled meter read date, both processes will run concurrently and both processes will be allowed to complete.  If the submitting CR is not scheduled to be the CR of Record on the scheduled meter read date of the move out, ERCOT cancels the move out.
15.1.6.2	Move In Date Equal to Move Out Date
(1)	ERCOT performs evaluations two Retail Business Days prior to all move in and move out scheduled meter read dates or upon the receipt of the TDSP response, whichever is later.  If the move in scheduled meter read date is equal to the move out scheduled meter read date, the move out transaction is cancelled by ERCOT.  If the move out is not scheduled, but the requested date is equal to the scheduled date for the move in, the move out transaction is cancelled by ERCOT.
(2)	If the ERCOT evaluation is performed for a same day move in and a move out is already scheduled for the current day, ERCOT will not cancel the move out and will leave it in a scheduled status.  If the TDSP chooses not to work the move out the TDSP will complete unexecute the move out.  In the event the move out is not complete or complete unexecutable by the TDSP within four Retail Business Days, ERCOT will cancel the move out.
15.1.6.3	Move In Date Prior to or Equal to Switch Date
(1)	ERCOT performs evaluations two Retail Business Days prior to all move in scheduled meter read dates or upon the receipt of the TDSP response, whichever is later.  If there is a switch with a scheduled meter read date after or equal to the move -in scheduled meter read date, the switch transaction is cancelled by ERCOT.  If the switch is not scheduled, but the requested date (FASD for standard switches) is after or equal to the scheduled date for the move in, the switch transaction is cancelled by ERCOT.
15.1.6.4	Move In Date After Switch Date
(1)	ERCOT performs evaluations two Retail Business Days prior to all move in scheduled meter read dates or upon the receipt of the TDSP response, whichever is later.

(1)	ERCOT performs evaluations two Retail Business Days prior to all move out scheduled meter read dates or upon the receipt of the TDSP response, whichever is later.  If there is a switch with a scheduled meter read date after or equal to the move out scheduled meter read date, the switch transaction is cancelled by ERCOT.  If the switch is not scheduled, but the requested date (FASD for standard switches) is after or equal to the scheduled date for the move out, the switch transaction is cancelled by ERCOT.
15.1.6.7	Move Out Date After Switch Date
(1)	ERCOT performs evaluations two Retail Business Days prior to all move out scheduled meter read dates or upon the receipt of the TDSP response, whichever is later.  If the move out scheduled meter read date is after a switch scheduled meter read date, both processes will run concurrently and both processes will be allowed to complete.  If the submitting CR is not scheduled to be the CR of Record on the scheduled meter read date of the move out, ERCOT cancels the move out.
15.1.6.8	Move Out Date After Mass Transition Drop Date
(1)	ERCOT performs evaluations two Retail Business Days prior to all move out scheduled meter read dates or upon the receipt of the TDSP response, whichever is later.  If the move out scheduled meter read date is after a Mass Transition drop scheduled meter read date, both processes will run concurrently and both processes will be allowed to complete.

If one of the move ins has a “cancel pending” status it will be cancelled by ERCOT and the other one will be allowed to complete.
15.1.6.11	Multiple Move Outs
(1)	ERCOT performs evaluations two Retail Business Days prior to all move out scheduled meter read dates or upon the receipt of the TDSP response, whichever is later.  If there is another move out with a scheduled meter read date after or prior to the move out scheduled meter read date, both processes will run concurrently and both processes will be allowed to complete.  If the submitting CR is not scheduled to be the CR of Record on the scheduled meter read date of the move out, ERCOT cancels the move out.  If there is another move out with a scheduled meter read date equal to the move out scheduled meter read date and neither have a “cancel pending” status, ERCOT will cancel the second move out received based on receipt date/time of the initiating transaction.  If one of the move outs has a “cancel pending” status, it will be cancelled by ERCOT and the other one will be allowed to complete.
15.1.7	Move In or Move Out Date Change
(1)	The CR will send a date change transaction using the 814_12, Date Change Request.  ERCOT will accept date changes on or before the day preceding the scheduled move in or move out.  ERCOT will reject any 814_12 transaction received on the scheduled move in or move out date, as well as date change requests on orders that were scheduled in the past.
(2)	If the date change does not pass validation, ERCOT will reply to the CR with a rejection of the date change transaction using the 814_13, Date Change Response, within two Retail Business Hours of receipt of the 814_12 transaction with the exception of a date change that is invalid because of “Item or Service Not Established.”  In the case of “Item or Service Not Established,” ERCOT will hold the date change request and continue to retry the request at regular intervals for 48 hours counting only hours on Retail Business Days, but not only Business Hours.
(3)	If the date change is accepted, ERCOT will notify the TDSP using the 814_12 transaction within two Retail Business Hours of receipt of the 814_12 transaction from the CR.  The TDSP will respond within two Retail Business Days using the 814_13 transaction.  If the TDSP accepts the date change, the submitting CR is notified via the 814_13 transaction and the other CR is notified via the 814_12 transaction.  ERCOT will only send the 814_12 transaction to the Losing CR on a move in if ERCOT has already sent the 814_06, Loss Notification, to the Losing CR.  ERCOT will only send the 814_12 transaction to the Gaining CR on a move out to CSA if ERCOT has already sent the 814_22, CSA CR Move In Request, to the CSA CR.
15.1.8	Cancellation of Registration Transactions
(1)	The CR will send a cancellation notice using the 814_08, Cancel Request.  ERCOT will accept cancellations on or before the day preceding the move in, move out or switch scheduled date.  ERCOT will reject any 814_08 transaction received on the scheduled move in, move out or switch date, as well as cancellation requests on orders that were scheduled in the past.
(2)	If the cancellation does not pass validation, ERCOT will reply to the CR within two Retail Business Hours with a rejection of the cancellation notice using the 814_09, Cancel Response, with the exception of a cancellation that is invalid because of “Item or Service Not Established.”  In the case of “Item or Service Not Established,” ERCOT will hold the cancellation request and continue to retry the request at regular intervals for 48 hours counting only hours on Retail Business Days, but not only Business Hours.
(3)	If the cancellation notice is accepted, ERCOT will set the status to “cancel pending” status and notify the TDSP within two Retail Business Hours using the 814_08 transaction.  If the TDSP accepts the cancel, ERCOT will cancel the transaction and notify the submitting CR using the 814_09 transaction.  When ERCOT has sent the current CR an 814_06, Loss Notification, the current CR will be sent an 814_08 transaction.  On a move out to CSA, if ERCOT has sent the 814_22, CSA CR Move In Request, to the CSA CR, the CSA CR will be sent an 814_08 transaction.  If the TDSP rejects the cancel, ERCOT will reset the status to “in review,” “permit pending,” or “scheduled” as appropriate, and forward the reject to the CR.  The TDSP will respond within one Retail Business Day using the 814_09 transaction.

(o)	Switch hold indicator;
(p)	County; and
(q)	Metered service type.
(2) 	At least daily, ERCOT will provide all of the attributes listed above when an 814_20, ESI ID Maintenance Request, is received and accepted by ERCOT that creates an ESI ID, or makes changes to the switch hold or the provisioned AMS meter indicator of an ESI ID.
15.2.1	Find ESI ID Function on the Market Information System 
(1)	Market Participants with an ERCOT digital certificate can obtain information to verify the Service Address for a Service Delivery Point using the Find ESI ID function on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area.  The Find ESI ID function returns the information as identified in Section 15.2, Database Queries.
15.2.2	Find Transaction Function on the Market Information System 
(1)	Competitive Retailers (CRs) or TDSPs with an ERCOT digital certificate may obtain transaction information from ERCOT to review business processes (i.e. Switch Request, Move-In Request, etc.) on ESI IDs.  The Find Transaction function provides both summary and detailed transaction information for an ESI ID.  The data displayed is confidential information and therefore is restricted by digital certificate.  Access to the ESI ID information displayed is limited based on transaction receiver/sender, TDSP ownership, or the Retail Electric Provider (REP) of Record for each ESI ID.  MIS help screens provide detailed descriptions of the field contents and related screens.  
15.2.3	Electric Service Identifier Extract on the Market Information System 
(1)	ERCOT posts a downloadable extract to the ERCOT website which contains the same information as listed in Section 15.2, Database Queries.  The information provided allows Entities that do not have a digital certificate and are unable to access the information through the Find ESI ID function to use the information to determine or to verify the ESI ID for a Service Delivery Point using the Service Address.  This extract is also used by Entities to incorporate ESI ID information into their database systems.
15.3	Monthly Meter Reads
(1)	Each Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) shall send monthly consumption information for all non-ERCOT-Polled Settlement (EPS) Meter Electric Service Identifiers (ESI IDs) within its service area to ERCOT not later than three Retail Business Days after the scheduled meter read cycle or scheduled meter cycle by day of the month for a point of delivery, using the 867_03, Monthly or Final Usage.  TDSPs shall send monthly consumption information for all ESI IDs associated with EPS-metered facilities to ERCOT no later than three Retail Business Days after TDSP receipt of daily EPS Meter data from ERCOT according to the TDSP scheduled meter read cycle or scheduled meter cycle by day of the month for a point of delivery, using the 867_03 transaction.  ERCOT will forward ERCOT-accepted consumption information to the Competitive Retailer (CR) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number provided in the 867_03 transaction by the TDSP within 12 hours.
(2)	If the meter read for an ESI ID fails the TDSP’s internal validation procedures, the TDSP may, at its discretion, delay sending consumption information for the ESI ID to ERCOT for an additional seven days in order to obtain a valid meter reading.
(3)	If a TDSP is unable to obtain a meter reading for an ESI ID because the TDSP is denied access to the meter, the TDSP may, at its discretion, delay sending consumption information for the ESI ID to ERCOT for an additional seven days in order to obtain a valid meter reading.
(4)	A TDSP, with notification to the market, may suspend the transmission of monthly consumption information during periods of storm restoration or other emergency operations undertaken pursuant to its emergency operations plan.
(5)	For non-ERCOT ESI IDs, TDSPs shall have the option of sending monthly consumption information and effectuating meter reads to ERCOT using the 867_03 transaction.  ERCOT will then forward the monthly consumption and meter read information to the CR DUNS Number provided in the 867_03 transaction by the TDSP within one Retail Business Day.
15.4	Electric Service Identifier
(1)	Each Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) Service Delivery Point shall have a unique number within Texas.  Once this unique number has been created and assigned to a Service Delivery Point, it shall not be re-issued, even in the event of termination of the associated point-of-service.  This unique number shall be referred to as the Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID).
(2)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, in those situations where an ESI ID has been inadvertently placed into inactive status and upon notification from the responsible TDSP, ERCOT shall re-instate the ESI ID for that Service Delivery Point.
15.4.1	Electric Service Identifier Format 
(1)	The ESI ID will have the following format:
10xxxxxyyy..yy
Where:
10	Represents a placeholder for future use;
xxxxx	Is the five-digit Department of Energy identification code for the assigning TDSP; and
yyy..yy	Is up to 29 alphanumeric characters assigned by the TDSP.
(2)	Allowable alphanumeric characters are 0-9 and A-Z.  The total length of the ESI ID cannot exceed 36 alphanumeric characters.
(3)	It is the TDSP’s responsibility to create, assign, maintain and retire, as necessary, an ESI ID to each Service Delivery Point in its service area.
15.4.1.1	Assignment of ESI IDs to Unmetered Service Delivery Points
(1)	In general, each unmetered Service Delivery Point will be assigned an ESI ID corresponding to the point of delivery from the TDSP system to the Customer or Load.  The TDSP may, however, aggregate unmetered Service Delivery Points into one ESI ID provided they meet all of the following conditions:
(a)	The Service Delivery Points are owned by the same Customer and are located at the same physical location (an exception is allowed for governmental unmetered loads such as street lighting and traffic signals);
(b)	All Service Delivery Points have the same Usage Profile;
(c)	All Service Delivery Points have the same voltage and are located in the same Unaccounted for Energy (UFE) zone and same Load Zone; and
(d)	The TDSP’s tariffs allow aggregation of unmetered Service Delivery Points.
15.4.1.2	Assignment of ESI IDs to metered Service Delivery Points
(1)	In general, each metered Service Delivery Point will be assigned an ESI ID corresponding to an existing billing meter.  However, the TDSP may aggregate metered Service Delivery Points into one ESI ID provided they meet all the following conditions:
(a)	The Service Delivery Points are owned by the same Customer and are at the same Service Address;
(b)	All Service Delivery Points have the same Load Profile or all Service Delivery Points have Interval Data Recorders (IDRs);
(c)	All Service Delivery Points have the same voltage and are located in the same UFE zone and same Load Zone; and
(d)	The TDSP’s tariffs allow aggregation of separately metered Service Delivery Points.
(2)	A Customer may request that the TDSP assign separate ESI IDs for separate Service Delivery Points as allowed in the TDSP’s tariffs.
(3)	A TDSP may not assign an ESI ID to submeters where the energy consumption for those meters is included in another ESI ID.  This does not prohibit the TDSP from tracking these submeters internally or charging for submetering services via the Competitive Retailer (CR).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, TDSPs using the practice of subtract metering shall assign an ESI ID to both the master meter and the subtract meter and report adjusted consumption accordingly.
15.4.1.3	Splitting a Service Delivery Point into Multiple ESI IDs
(1)	A Service Delivery Point with Load above one MW may split the actual meter into up to four virtual meters which would each have its own ESI ID.  This process of splitting the meter into separate ESI IDs shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of Section 10, Metering.  Reissuing and reassignment of ESI IDs is prohibited.
15.4.1.4	New Electric Service Identifier Creation
(1)	Since it is anticipated that the ESI ID will be based on the existing TDSP account or Premise numbers (with a prefix identifying the TDSP), the TDSP will assign and submit to the registration database ESI IDs for new Premises as service is extended to them.  TDSPs that opt in after the market startup will be responsible for the creation of ESI IDs for all existing Service Delivery Points in their service territory.
(2)	The TDSP will send ESI ID information using the 814_20, ESI ID Maintenance Request.  ERCOT will verify that this transaction meets Texas Standard Electronic Transaction (TX SET) specifications.  ERCOT will respond to the TDSP within one Retail Business Hour, with acceptance or rejection of these transactions using the 814_21, ESI ID Maintenance Response.  At least the following data elements are required to be sent in the 814_20 transaction:
(a)	ESI ID;
(b)	Service Address; city, state, zip, county;
(c)	Load Profile Type;
(d)	Meter reading cycle or meter cycle by day of month;
(e)	Station ID;
(f)	Distribution Loss Factor (DLF) code; and
(g)	Premise type.
(3)	The TDSP must receive an accepted 814_21 from ERCOT prior to initiating electric service pursuant to Section 15.1.4, Beginning Service (New Construction Completed and Move Ins).
15.4.1.5	Electric Service Identifier Maintenance
(1)	The TDSP will notify ERCOT of any changes in information related to an ESI ID for which it is responsible.  The TDSP will send changes to ERCOT using the 814_20, ESI ID Maintenance Request.  ERCOT will respond to the TDSP within four Retail Business Hours, using the 814_21, ESI ID Maintenance Response.  In addition, ERCOT will send all affected CRs notice of the changes using the 814_20 transaction.  The TDSP is responsible for the following data elements:
(a)	Service Address; city, state, zip, county;
(b)	Load Profile Type;
(c)	Meter reading cycle or meter cycle by day of month;
(d)	Station ID;
(e)	DLF code;
(f)	Eligibility date;
(g)	Meter type;
(h)	Rate class and sub-class, if applicable;
(i)	Special needs indicator;
(j)	Meter type, identification number, number of dials and role for each meter at the ESI ID, if ESI ID is metered;
(k)	For unmetered ESI IDs, number and description of each unmetered device; 
(l)	Premise type;
(m)	Advanced Metering System (AMS) or Municipally Owned Utility (MOU) / Electric Cooperative (EC) Non-BUSIDRRQ IDR indicator;
(n)	Switch hold indicator; and
(o)	Metered service type description (if provided).
(2)	If the 814_20 transaction is invalid, ERCOT will respond to the TDSP using the 814_21 transaction within four Retail Business Hours of receipt of the 814_20, with the exception of an 814_20 transaction that is invalid because of “ESI ID Invalid or Not Found.”  In the case of “ESI ID Invalid or Not Found,” ERCOT will hold the 814_20 transaction and continue to retry the request at regular intervals for 48 hours counting only hours on Retail Business Days, but not only Business Hours.  If the request remains invalid for 48 hours, the process will terminate and ERCOT will forward an 814_21 transaction.

(e)	A shareholder with more than 10% equity of the Entity; or
(f)	A person that has authority to make decisions under these Protocols on behalf of the registered Market Participant or applicant, and is not otherwise controlled by any of the other Principal types listed above, or as otherwise identified by ERCOT.
16.1.3	Market Participant Citizenship, Ownership, or Headquarters
(1)	An Entity is not eligible to register or maintain its registration with ERCOT as a Market Participant if the Entity:
(a)	Is a person who is a citizen of a Lone Star Infrastructure Protection Act (LSIPA) Designated Country; or   
(b)	Is an LSIPA Designated Company.  
(2)	If an Entity meets any of the above listed criteria solely due to the citizenship, ownership or headquarters of a wholly owned subsidiary, majority-owned subsidiary, or Affiliate, the Entity will be eligible to register as a Market Participant, subject to paragraph (5) below, if it certifies that the subsidiary or Affiliate at issue will not have direct or remote access to or control of ERCOT’s Wide Area Network (WAN), Market Information System (MIS), or any data from such ERCOT systems. 
(3)	Any Entity that seeks to register as a Market Participant shall submit an attestation as reflected in Section 23, Form Q, Attestation Regarding Market Participant Citizenship, Ownership, or Headquarters, certifying that the Entity complies with the above criteria, to the best of the Entity’s knowledge and belief following reasonable diligence.
(4)	If there are changes to a Market Participant’s citizenship, ownership, or headquarters such that the Market Participant meets any of the prohibited company citizenship, ownership (including Affiliations) or headquarters criteria of an LSIPA Designated Company, then the Market Participant shall execute and submit a new attestation to ERCOT within ten Business Days of the change becoming effective.
(5)	ERCOT may immediately suspend or terminate a Market Participant’s registration or access to any of ERCOT’s systems if ERCOT has a reasonable suspicion that the Entity meets any of the criteria described by paragraph (1) above or that an Entity has provided access or control to a subsidiary or Affiliate as described by paragraph (2) above.
16.1.4	Market Participant Reporting of Critical Electric Grid Equipment and Services-Related Purchases
(1)	As a condition of registering and maintaining registration with ERCOT as a Market Participant, an Entity shall report to ERCOT the purchase, lease, or receipt (referred to in this Section as a “purchase”) of any Critical Electric Grid Equipment (CEGE) or Critical Electric Grid Services (CEGS) that the Entity knows to be from an LSIPA Designated Company or an LSIPA Designated Country.  This includes, but is not limited to, a purchase of CEGE or CEGS that were manufactured, produced, created, or otherwise provided by a company known to the Entity to be an LSIPA Designated Company and subsequently sold to the Entity by a non-LSIPA Designated Company.  
(a)	As used in this Section 16.1.4 and Section 23, Form S, Reporting and Attestation Regarding Purchase of Critical Electric Grid Equipment (CEGE) and Critical Electric Grid Services (CEGS) from a Lone Star Infrastructure Protection Act (LSIPA) Designated Company or LSIPA Designated Country, the terms “knows,” “known,” and “knowledge” refer to the Entity’s actual knowledge or knowledge that the Entity could have obtained through reasonable inquiry with respect to any clearly evident, non-obscure information indicating that the equipment or service was manufactured, produced, created, or otherwise provided by an LSIPA Designated Company.   
(b)	If the Entity obtains a contractual representation (or either a letter of attestation or a contractual representation if the purchase was made before June 8, 2023) from the seller of CEGE or CEGS that the equipment or services were not manufactured, produced, created, or otherwise provided by an LSIPA Designated Company, then absent some clearly evident, non-obscure information raising such suspicion, this Section 16.1.4 does not require the Entity to conduct diligence or otherwise inquire as to the identity or location of the manufacturer, producer, or creator of the CEGE or CEGS that the Entity purchases or any component parts thereof.  For the avoidance of doubt, this subsection does not create or suggest a requirement not otherwise imposed by this Section 16.1.4.
(c)	If a Market Participant or an Entity applying for registration purchases CEGE from a non-LSIPA Designated Company and clearly evident, non-obscure information indicates that such equipment has a part or component (which itself has routable connectivity) that originated from an LSIPA Designated Company or LSIPA Designated Country, then such part or component shall be reported using Section 23, Form S, but in Subsections 2(a)-(b) of Section 23, Form S, the Entity or Market Participant is only required to provide the following information for the part or component: 
(i)	A general description of the part or component; 
(ii)	The name of the LSIPA Designated Country from which the part or component originated; and 
(iii)	The name of the LSIPA Designated Company from which the part or component originated, unless the Market Participant or Entity applying for registration does not actually know the name of the LSIPA Designated Company.  
(d)	For each reported purchase made after June 8, 2023, the Market Participant or Entity applying for registration shall attest that the purchase will not result in access to or control of CEGE by an LSIPA Designated Company or an LSIPA Designated Country, excluding access specifically allowed by the Market Participant or Entity applying for registration for product warranty and support purposes. 
(e)	For any purchases made before June 8, 2023, the Market Participant or Entity applying for registration shall take reasonable and necessary actions to mitigate access to or control of its CEGE by a company known to the Entity to be an LSIPA Designated Company or an LSIPA Designated Country, excluding access specifically allowed by the Market Participant or Entity applying for registration for product warranty and support purposes, and shall report those actions to ERCOT on the form reflected in Section 23, Form S. 
(2)	Market Participants and Entities applying for registration with ERCOT shall submit an initial report and attestation, on the form reflected in Section 23, Form S identifying any purchase described in paragraph (1) above that occurred during the following time periods:
(a)	For a Market Participant, purchase(s) that were made after June 18, 2021.  This initial report and attestation shall be submitted by October 28, 2024; 
(b)	For a Market Participant, purchase(s) that were made between June 8, 2018 through June 18, 2021.  This initial report and attestation shall be submitted by December 15, 2024; and
(c)	For an Entity applying for registration with ERCOT, purchase(s) that were made within the five years preceding the date on which the Entity signed the Standard Form Agreement.  This initial report and attestation must be submitted before ERCOT may approve registration.
(3)	A Market Participant shall submit a report and attestation, on the form reflected in Section 23, Form S, identifying any purchase(s) described in paragraph (1) above that occur after the date(s) of the purchases reported pursuant to paragraph (2) above and that have not already been reported pursuant to this Section. 
(4)	Reports and attestations submitted pursuant to paragraph (3) above shall be submitted within 180 days of the date of the  purchase. 
16.2	Registration and Qualification of Qualified Scheduling Entities
16.2.1	Criteria for Qualification as a Qualified Scheduling Entity 
(1)	To become and remain a Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE), an Entity must meet the following requirements:
(a)	Submit a properly completed QSE application for qualification, including any applicable fee, necessary disclosures, and designation of Authorized Representatives, each of whom is responsible for administrative communications with the QSE and each of whom has enough authority to commit and bind the QSE and the Entities it represents;
(b)	Comply with ERCOT’s background check process, as described in Section 16.2.1.1, QSE Background Check Process;
(c)	Demonstrate to ERCOT’s reasonable satisfaction that the Entity does not pose an “Unreasonable Financial Risk”, as defined in this Section;
(d)	Sign a Standard Form Market Participant Agreement; 
(e)	Sign any required Agreements relating to use of the ERCOT Wide Area Network (WAN), software, and systems;
(f)	Demonstrate to ERCOT’s reasonable satisfaction that the Entity is capable of performing the functions of a QSE; 
(g)	Demonstrate to ERCOT’s reasonable satisfaction that the Entity is capable of complying with the requirements of all ERCOT Protocols and Operating Guides; 
(h)	Satisfy ERCOT’s creditworthiness requirements as set forth in this Section, unless exempted from these requirements by Section 16.17, Exemption for Qualified Scheduling Entities Participating Only in Emergency Response Service;
(i)	Be generally able to pay its debts as they come due.  ERCOT may request evidence of compliance with this qualification only if ERCOT reasonably believes that a QSE is failing to comply with it;
(j)	Provide all necessary bank account information and arrange for Fedwire system transfers for two-way confirmation; 
(k)	Be financially responsible for payment of Settlement charges for those Entities it represents under these Protocols;
(l)	Submit an executed ERCOT Private Wide Area Network (WAN) Agreement under Section 23, Form K, Wide Area Network (WAN) Agreement, for WAN Participants; 
(m)	Comply with the backup plan requirements for WAN Participants, if applicable, in accordance with the Operating Guides; 
(n)	Demonstrate to ERCOT’s reasonable satisfaction that the Entity can maintain a 24-hour, seven-day-per-week control or operations center with qualified personnel for the purposes of communicating with ERCOT relating to Day-Ahead and Operating Day exchange of market and operational obligations.  This requirement applies to QSEs that are WAN Participants.  Control or operations center personnel must be responsible for operational communications and must have sufficient authority to commit and bind the QSE and the Entities that it represents;
(o)	Demonstrate and maintain a working functional interface with all required ERCOT computer systems;
(p)	Allow ERCOT, upon reasonable notice, to conduct a site visit to verify information provided by the QSE; and
(q)	If a QSE represents a Resource Entity, Emergency Response Service (ERS) Resource, or another QSE and receives or transmits WAN Data, it must maintain connection to a Secure Private Network (SPN) or equivalent network as described in Nodal Operating Guide Section 7.1.2, WAN Participant Responsibilities.  
(2)	If a QSE chooses to use Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions to receive Settlement Statements and Invoices, it must participate in and successfully complete testing as described in Section 19.8, Retail Market Testing, before starting operations with ERCOT as a QSE.
(3)	A QSE must be able to demonstrate to ERCOT’s reasonable satisfaction that it does not pose an Unreasonable Financial Risk.  Unreasonable Financial Risk as used in Section 16, Registration and Qualification of Market Participants, is a risk of financial default posed to ERCOT or its Market Participants by participation of an Entity or its Principals in the ERCOT market.  Indicators of Unreasonable Financial Risk may include, but are not limited to: past market manipulation, trading violations, or other finance-related violations based upon a final adjudication in state or federal regulatory or legal proceedings; financial defaults in ERCOT or other energy markets resulting in losses or uplifts; indications of imminent bankruptcy or insolvency, or other past civil judgement or criminal conviction that reflects problematic behavior on the part of the Entity or its Principals.
(4)	A QSE or QSE applicant must be able to demonstrate to ERCOT’s reasonable satisfaction that none of its Principals were or are Principals of any Entity with an outstanding payment obligation that remains owing to ERCOT under any Agreement or these Protocols.  For purposes of this Section, ERCOT will only consider disqualifying those Principals of the QSE or QSE applicant who were Principals of the other Entity at a time during which the unpaid financial obligation remained owing to ERCOT or during the 120-day period prior to the date on which the unpaid financial obligation first became due and owing to ERCOT.
(5)	If any of a QSE’s or QSE applicant’s Principals were or are Principals of a terminated Market Participant with an obligation for Default Uplift Ratio Share allocated under Section 9.19.1, Default Uplift Invoices, the terminated Market Participant must be current on all payment obligations for Default Uplift Invoices in order for the QSE to remain, or QSE applicant to become, a registered QSE.  For purposes of this Section, ERCOT will only consider as disqualifying those Principals of the QSE or QSE applicant who were Principals of the other Entity at a time during which the other Entity was not current on its payment obligation for Default Uplift Invoices or 120 days prior to the date the other Entity first failed to pay a Default Uplift Invoice.
(6)	A QSE shall promptly notify ERCOT of any change that a reasonable examiner may deem material to the QSE’s ability to continue to meet the requirements set forth in this Section, and any material change in the information provided by the QSE to ERCOT that may adversely affect the reliability or safety of the ERCOT System or the financial security of ERCOT.  This includes any changes in the Principals of the QSE.  If the QSE fails to so notify ERCOT of such change within two Business Days after becoming aware of the change, then ERCOT may, after providing notice to each Entity represented by the QSE, refuse to allow the QSE to perform as a QSE and take any other action ERCOT deems appropriate, in its sole discretion, to prevent ERCOT or Market Participants from bearing potential or actual risks, financial or otherwise, arising from those changes, and in accordance with these Protocols.  
(7)	Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, a QSE may partition itself into any number of subordinate QSEs (“Subordinate QSEs”).  If a single Entity requests to partition itself into more than four Subordinate QSEs, ERCOT may implement the request subject to ERCOT’s reasonable determination that the additional requested Subordinate QSEs will not be likely to overburden ERCOT’s staffing or systems.  ERCOT shall adopt an implementation plan allowing phased-in registration for these additional Subordinate QSEs in order to mitigate system or staffing impacts.  However, ERCOT may not unreasonably delay that registration. 
(8)	Each Subordinate QSE must be treated as an individual QSE for all purposes including communications and control functions except for liability, financial security, and financial liability requirements under this Section.  That liability, financial security, and financial liability is cumulative for all Subordinate QSEs for the single Entity signing the QSE Agreement.    
(9)	Continued qualification as a QSE is contingent upon compliance with all applicable requirements in these Protocols.  ERCOT may suspend a QSE’s rights as a Market Participant when ERCOT reasonably determines that it is an appropriate remedy for the Entity’s failure to satisfy any applicable requirement.
(10)	Each QSE that is a WAN Participant, or its designated QSE agent, shall maintain 24-hour, seven-day-per-week operations and Hotline communications with ERCOT and answer each QSE Hotline call.
16.2.1.1	QSE Background Check Process
(1)	A QSE applicant must satisfy a background check as a part of the ERCOT registration process.  All background checks will be performed by a third-party acting on ERCOT’s behalf.  Upon ERCOT’s request, a registered QSE may be required to satisfy a background check as a condition of maintaining its ERCOT registration.  
(2)	A QSE, QSE applicants, and their Principals, will provide the following disclosures to complete a QSE background check:
(a)	Any civil or criminal matters involving the applicant, its predecessors, Affiliates, or Principals within the last ten years that resulted in a conviction or finding of fraud, theft, larceny, deceit, deceptive trade practices, or a violation of securities or customer protection laws;

16.2.3.3	Qualified Scheduling Entity Service Termination
(1)	If a QSE intends to terminate representation of a Resource Entity that owns or controls a Resource that is in the ERCOT Network Operations Model (other than a Resource Entity serving as its own QSE, in which case this Section does not apply), the QSE shall provide, no less than 45 days before the specified effective termination date (“Termination Date”), written notice to ERCOT and the Resource.
(2)	If a QSE intends to terminate representation of a Load Serving Entity (LSE) or a Resource Entity that does not own or control a Resource that is in the ERCOT Network Operations Model (other than an LSE or Resource Entity serving as its own QSE, in which case this Section does not apply), the QSE shall provide, no less than 12 Business Days before the specified effective Termination Date, written notice to ERCOT and the LSE or Resource Entity.
(3)	Effective at 2400 on the Termination Date specified by the QSE, the QSE may no longer provide QSE services for or represent the terminated LSE or Resource.  The QSE is responsible for settlement obligations that the QSE has incurred on behalf of the terminated LSE or Resource before the termination.  The QSE must participate in Real-Time Operations through the Termination Date and provide updates pursuant to these Protocols for the Operating Day which is the Termination Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, before the Termination Date, the LSE/Resource: 
(a)	Affiliates itself with a new QSE, or 
(b)	Fulfills ERCOT’s creditworthiness requirements in order to become an Emergency QSE,
the QSE that provided notice of the intent to terminate representation of the LSE/ Resource will no longer be responsible for the terminated LSE/Resource upon the effective date of the new QSE’s representation of that LSE/Resource, or the LSE/Resource qualifying as an Emergency QSE.
(4)	Within two Business Days of notice of a QSE’s intent to terminate representation of an LSE, ERCOT shall notify the LSE of the level of credit the LSE must provide, if it becomes an Emergency QSE, and the date by which it must post the required collateral.
16.2.4	Posting of Qualified Scheduling Entity List
(1)	ERCOT shall post on the ERCOT website and maintain a current list of all QSEs.  ERCOT shall include with that posting a cautionary statement that inclusion on that list does not necessarily mean that a QSE is entitled to provide any service to a third party, nor does it obligate a QSE to provide any service to a third party.
16.2.5	Suspended or Terminated Qualified Scheduling Entity – Notification to LSEs and Resource Entities Represented
(1)	If ERCOT suspends a QSE or terminates the QSE’s Standard Form Market Participant Agreement for Default, ERCOT shall notify the affected LSEs and Resource Entities that the QSE has been suspended or terminated and the effective date of such suspension or termination.  
(2)	If an LSE or Resource Entity represented by a terminated or suspended QSE is the same Entity as the terminated or suspended QSE, the provisions of Section 16.11.6.1.6, Revocation of a Market Participant’s Rights and Termination of Agreements, shall apply to that LSE or Resource Entity, and that LSE or Resource Entity shall not be entitled to become an Emergency QSE.
16.2.6	Emergency Qualified Scheduling Entity
16.2.6.1	Designation as an Emergency Qualified Scheduling Entity or Virtual Qualified Scheduling Entity
(1)	A “Virtual QSE” is defined as an LSE or Resource Entity that has not qualified and been designated as an Emergency QSE, but has been designated by ERCOT to temporarily perform the responsibilities of a QSE. 
(2)	If a QSE has given Notice of its intent to terminate its relationship with an LSE or Resource Entity, that LSE or Resource Entity, must, by noon on the fourth Business Day after the termination notice date, either:
(a) 	Designate a new QSE with such relationship to take effect on the Termination Date, or earlier if allowed by ERCOT; or
(b) 	Satisfy all necessary creditworthiness requirements for QSEs as described in Section 16.2, Registration and Qualification of Qualified Scheduling Entities, and operate as an Emergency QSE as described below.  
(3)	If ERCOT has given Notice of an LSE’s or Resource Entity’s QSE’s termination or suspension, that LSE or Resource Entity will be designated as a Virtual QSE for up to two Bank Business Days, during which time it must either: 
	(a) 	Designate and begin operations with a new QSE; or
(b) 	Satisfy all necessary creditworthiness requirements for QSEs as described in Section 16.2, and operate as an Emergency QSE as described below.  As provided in paragraph (2) of Section 16.2.5, Suspended or Terminated Qualified Scheduling Entity – Notification to LSEs and Resource Entities Represented, this option does not apply to an LSE or Resource Entity represented by a terminated or suspended QSE that is the same Entity as the terminated or suspended QSE.
(4)	If an LSE or Resource Entity meets the creditworthiness requirements, the LSE or Resource Entity may be designated as an Emergency QSE except as provided in paragraph (2) of Section 16.2.5 and may, upon the Termination Date, be issued Digital Certificates and given access to the Market Information System (MIS) as determined by ERCOT.
(5)	If the LSE fails to meet the requirements of one of the above options in the timeframe set forth above, it shall constitute a QSE Affiliation Breach under the LSE’s Standard Form Market Participant Agreement.  If the LSE fails to cure the QSE Affiliation Breach within the cure period set forth in the Standard Form Market Participant Agreement, and the LSE serves Load, ERCOT shall, after notice as specified in Retail Market Guide Section 7.11, Transition Process, initiate a Mass Transition of the LSE’s Electronic Service Identifiers (ESI IDs) pursuant to Section 15.1.3, Transition Process.
(6)	If a Resource Entity fails to meet the requirements of one of the options set forth in paragraph (2) or (3) above within the requisite timeframe, it shall constitute a QSE Affiliation Breach under the Resource Entity’s Standard Form Market Participant Agreement, provided that ERCOT may allow the Resource Entity additional time, as determined by ERCOT staff, to meet the requirements.
(7)	For any Operating Day in which an LSE or Resource Entity is not either represented by a QSE or qualified as an Emergency QSE, ERCOT may designate the LSE or Resource Entity as a Virtual QSE.  ERCOT may issue Digital Certificates to the Virtual QSE for access to the capabilities of the MIS.  A Virtual QSE shall be liable for any and all charges associated with Initial, Final and True-Up Settlements as well as any Resettlements applying to dates during which the Virtual QSE represented ESI IDs or otherwise incurred charges pursuant to these Protocols, along with any and all costs incurred by ERCOT in collecting such amounts.
(8)	ERCOT shall maintain a referral list of qualified QSEs on the ERCOT website who request to be listed as providing QSE services on short notice.  The list shall include the QSE’s name, contact information and whether they are qualified to represent Load and/or Resources and/or provide Ancillary Services.  ERCOT shall not be obligated to verify the abilities of any QSE so listed.  ERCOT shall require all QSEs listed to confirm their inclusion on the referral list no later than the start of each calendar year.
16.2.6.2	Market Participation by an Emergency Qualified Scheduling Entity or a Virtual Qualified Scheduling Entity
(1)	An Emergency QSE or a Virtual QSE may only represent itself; it may not represent another legal Entity. 
(2)	An Emergency QSE or a Virtual QSE that is also an LSE may only submit the following transactions, and may do so only to the extent that the transactions are intended to serve the Load of the Emergency QSE’s or Virtual QSE’s Customers: 
(a)	Energy Trades in which the Emergency QSE or the Virtual QSE is the buyer;
(b)	Capacity Trades in which the Emergency QSE or the Virtual QSE is the buyer;
(c)	Ancillary Service Trades in which the Emergency QSE or the Virtual QSE is the buyer; and
(d)	DAM Energy Bids. 
(3)	An Emergency QSE or a Virtual QSE that is also a Resource Entity may only submit transactions that are directly attributable to and wholly provided by the Resource Entity’s Resource(s).
16.2.6.3	Requirement to Obtain New Qualified Scheduling Entity or Qualified Scheduling Entity Qualification
(1)	Within seven Business Days after receiving designation as an Emergency QSE, an Emergency QSE must either: 
(a)	Designate a QSE that will represent the LSE or Resource Entity to ERCOT; or 
(b)	Fulfill all QSE registration and qualification requirements.  After completing the requirements in item (b), ERCOT may redesignate the Emergency QSE as a QSE.  
(2)	If an Emergency QSE that is an LSE fails to meet at least one of the requirements listed above within the allotted time, then ERCOT shall, after notice as specified in Retail Market Guide Section 7.11, Transition Process, initiate a Mass Transition of the LSE’s ESI IDs pursuant to Section 15.1.3, Transition Process.  If an Emergency QSE that is a Resource Entity fails to meet at least one of the requirements listed above within the allotted time, ERCOT may allow the Resource Entity additional time, as determined by ERCOT staff, to meet the requirements. 
16.2.7	Acceleration
(1)	Upon termination of a QSE’s rights as a QSE and the Standard Form Market Participant Agreement or any other Agreement(s) between ERCOT and the QSE, all sums owed to ERCOT are immediately accelerated and are immediately due and owing in full.  At that time, ERCOT may immediately draw upon any security or other collateral pledged to ERCOT and may offset or recoup all amounts due to ERCOT to satisfy those due and owing amounts.

A Resource Entity may submit a proposal to register the aggregation of generators, with the exception of Intermittent Renewable Resources (IRRs) pursuant to paragraph (13) of Section 3.10.7.2, Modeling of Resources and Transmission Loads, as an Aggregate Generation Resource (AGR) which ERCOT may grant at its sole discretion.  If a Resource Entity intends to register one or more Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) and one or more non-ESS generators as SOGs at the same site, the Resource Entity must provide an affidavit attesting to the amount of ESS and non-ESS capacity at the site as a condition for registration.    
(2)	Prior to commissioning, Resources Entities will regularly update the data necessary for modeling.  These updates will reflect the best available information at the time submitted.
(3)	Once ERCOT has received a new or amended Standard Generation Interconnection Agreement (SGIA) or a letter from a duly authorized official from the Municipally Owned Utility (MOU) or Electric Cooperative (EC) and has determined that the proposed Generation Resource, ESR, or SOG meets the requirements of Planning Guide Section 6.9, Addition of Proposed Generation to the Planning Models, ERCOT shall review the description of the proposed Generation Resource, ESR, or SOG in Exhibit “C” (or similar exhibit) to the SGIA and the data submitted pursuant to Planning Guide Section 6.8.2 to assess whether the Generation Resource, ESR, or SOG, as proposed, would violate any operational standards established in the Protocols, Planning Guide, Nodal Operating Guides, and Other Binding Documents.  ERCOT must provide its determination to the Transmission Service Provider (TSP) and the owner of the proposed Generation Resource, ESR, or SOG within 90 days of the date the Generation Resource, ESR, or SOG meets the conditions for review.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this determination shall not preclude ERCOT from subsequently determining that the Generation Resource, ESR, or SOG violates any operational standards established in the Protocols, Planning Guide, Nodal Operating Guides, and Other Binding Documents or from taking any appropriate action based on that determination.
