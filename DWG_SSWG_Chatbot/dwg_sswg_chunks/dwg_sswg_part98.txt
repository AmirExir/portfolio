4.8	HVDC Devices
HVDC Devices allow a specified real power flow to be imposed on the DC link.  For base case operation, this should be set to the desired interchange across the DC tie.  Capacitors, filter banks and reactors should be modeled explicitly and switched in or out of service based on normal DC tie operation.  The HVDC model itself normally calculates reactive power consumption.

HVDC ties with external interconnections may be modeled by the use of either the Two Terminal DC Transmi
