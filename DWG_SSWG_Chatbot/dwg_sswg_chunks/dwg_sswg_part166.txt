sfers between ERCOT and CFE. 



Normally Open Block Load Ties on Distribution 
  
There are three normally open ties with CFE that are on the 12.47 kV distribution systems. These ties are at Amistad, Presido and Redford. These ties are only used for emergency block load transfers. Since SSWG does not model radial distribution systems these points are not in the SSWG power flow cases.
