(h)	Any other relevant information of commercial significance to CRR Account Holders, including a list of Electrically Similar Settlement Points.
7.5.4	CRR Account Holder Responsibilities
(1)	Participating CRR Account Holders may submit CRR Auction Bids and CRR Auction Offers. 
(2)	Each CRR Account Holder must maintain adequate credit for its CRR holdings, and CRR Auction participation requirements, as described in Section 16, Registration and Qualification of Market Participants.
7.5.5	Auction Clearing Methodology
7.5.5.1	Creditworthiness
(1)	The CRR Auction system prevents a CRR Account Holder from being awarded bids and offers that exceed the lesser of the CRR Account Holder’s self-imposed credit limit or the credit limit as prescribed in Section 16.11.4.6.1, Credit Requirements for CRR Auction Participation.   
7.5.5.2	Disclosure of CRR Ownership
(1)	ERCOT shall post monthly, by the fifth Business Day of the month, on the ERCOT website CRR ownership of record information for each source and sink pair as follows: 
(a)	The identities of the CRR Account Holders;
(b)	Type of CRR held by that account holder; and
(c)	Total MWs held by that account holder.  
7.5.5.3	Auction Process
(1)	The CRR Auction must be a single-round, simultaneous auction for selling the CRRs available for all auction products.  ERCOT shall enter into the CRR Auction system a credit limit for each Counter-Party that has at least one CRR Account Holder.  A Counter-Party’s CRR Auction credit limit is equal to the lesser of the credit limit as determined in Section 16.11.4.6.1, Credit Requirements for CRR Auction Participation, or, if provided, the Counter-Party’s self-imposed CRR Auction credit limit for the CRR Monthly Auction or for a time-of-use within a CRR Auction held as part of a CRR Long-Term Auction Sequence.  
(2)	Prior to the CRR Auction, ERCOT will conduct a two-part pre-auction screening process. First, if the Counter-Party’s CRR Auction credit limit is greater than that Counter-Party’s credit exposure as defined below using the CRR bid volumes rather than awarded volumes, then the Counter-Party’s CRR Auction credit limit will be ignored as the CRR Auction is solved.  Second, for each CRR Account Holder of a Counter-Party, if the CRR Account Holder’s self-imposed credit limit is greater than that CRR Account Holder’s credit exposure as defined below, then the CRR Account Holder’s self-imposed credit limit will be ignored as the CRR Auction is solved. 
	The calculated exposure for the pre-auction screening for each CRR Account Holder is the sum of the credit exposure for PTP Obligation bids, PTP Obligation offers, and PTP Option bids for that CRR Account Holder.  The calculated exposure for the pre-auction screening for each Counter-Party is the sum of the credit exposure for PTP Obligation bids, PTP Obligation offers, and PTP Option bids for that Counter-Party.  PTP Option offers have zero credit exposure.  Separately, for PTP Obligation bids, PTP Obligation offers, and PTP Option bids, for each source/sink Settlement Point combination, the credit exposure will use the bid price and MW quantity that produces the maximum credit exposure that could result from the CRR Auction for that source/sink Settlement Point combination. 
(3)	The credit constraint for each Counter-Party is based on the following calculation:
ACR b 		= 	AOBLCR b  + AOPTCR b  - AOBLCRO b
Where:	
AOBLCR b = 	∑m ∑h ∑j, k [(BOBLMW m, h,(j, k), b * (Max(0, BPOBL m, h,(j, k), b) – Min(0,A ci99, m, h,(j, k), b, EACP m, h,(j, k) )))] 
AOPTCR b = 	∑m ∑h ∑j, k [(BOPTMW m, h,(j, k), b * BPOPT m, h,(j, k), b)]
AOBLCRO b = 	∑m ∑h ∑j, k (OOBLMW m, h,(j, k), b * Min(0, OPOBL m, h,(j, k), b))  
The above variables are defined as follows:

BPOBL m, h, (j, k), b	$/MW per hour	Bid Price for PTP Obligation—Bid Price for PTP Obligation with the source j and sink k for the hour h, and month m submitted by a Counter-Party b. 
A ci 99, m, h, (j, k), b	$/MW per hour	Path-Specific DAM-Based Adder—The path-specific DAM-based adder with the source j and sink k for the hour h, and month m submitted by a Counter-Party b; calculated as 99th percentile of the average rolling consecutive DAM settled price for the reference CRR source/sink over a period that represents a month for each product type (18 days for 5*16, 8 days for 2*16, 28 days for 7*8).  The look-back period for DAM settled prices shall be the lesser of Nodal Market go-live to current time and current time minus three years.  If historical Day-Ahead Settlement Point Prices (DASPPs) are not available for a Settlement Point for one or more Operating Days, ERCOT will designate a proxy Settlement Point for this purpose, and the DASPPs of the proxy Settlement Point of corresponding Operating Days are used.
EACP m, h, (j, k)	$/MW per hour	Effective Auction Clearing Price—The auction clearing price with the source j and sink k for the hour h, and month m.
For each CRR PTP Obligation, this value is equal to the auction clearing price of an awarded CRR selected as follows: 
(a)	Awarded CRRs with the source j and sink k containing hour h and operating month m are selected from the set of unexpired awarded PTP Obligations.  If no awarded CRRs are found the EACP value is zero.
(b)	If (a) results in more than one awarded CRR, awarded CRRs with the most recent award date are selected.
(c)	If (b) results in more than one awarded CRR, then the awarded CRR with the lowest auction clearing price is selected.

k	none	A sink Settlement Point.
ci99	none	99th percentile confidence interval.
(4)	ERCOT may review preliminary CRR Auction results to ensure that post auction collateral requirements are satisfied for all CRR Account Holders participating in the CRR Auction.  If it is practicable to rerun the applicable CRR Auction, and the post CRR Auction collateral requirements for a Counter-Party are not satisfied, ERCOT:
(a)	Shall promptly notify the Counter-Party of the amount by which its Financial Security must be increased and allow it until 1500 on the next Bank Business Day from the date on which ERCOT delivered Notification to increase the Financial Security.  
(b)	If sufficient Financial Security is not received by 1500 on the next Bank Business Day, ERCOT shall void all of the Counter-Party’s bids and offers in the CRR Auction and rerun the CRR Auction without that Counter-Party’s activity.
(c)	ERCOT shall award CRRs in quantities truncated to the nearest tenth MW (0.1 MW). 
(d)	The CRR clearing price is equal to the corresponding Shadow Price for that CRR product.
(e)	Except as noted in paragraph (f) below, when a CRR Account Holder is awarded CRRs as a result of a CRR Auction, the CRRs do not become the property of the winning CRR Account Holder, and the CRRs may not be placed in their CRR accounts, until the required CRR Invoice has been paid.
[NPRR1023:  Replace paragraph (e) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(e)	When a CRR Account Holder is awarded CRRs as a result of a CRR Auction, the CRRs do not become the property of the winning CRR Account Holder, and the CRRs may not be placed in their CRR accounts, until the required CRR Invoice has been paid.
(f)	Following a one-time auction of CRRs pursuant to Section 16.11.6.1.4, Repossession of CRRs by ERCOT, or Section 16.11.6.1.5, Declaration of Forfeit of CRRs, the CRRs may be placed in the account of the winning CRR Account Holder immediately upon determination of the winning bidder if the post-auction collateral requirement is satisfied and if ERCOT determines that the transfer is required to ensure the correctness of the inventory for any subsequent CRR Auction.  
[NPRR1023:  Delete paragraph (f) above upon system implementation.]
(5)	ERCOT shall use a linear programming auction engine model for each CRR Auction that evaluates all CRR Auction bids and CRR Auction offers submitted, and selects a combination of CRR Auction bids and CRR Auction offers that:
(a)	Makes the solution simultaneously feasible within the limits of the ERCOT network capability over the auction term; and
(b)	Maximizes the objective function, which is equal to the total economic value (as expressed in the CRR Auction bids) of the awarded CRR Auction bids, less the total economic cost (as expressed in CRR Auction offers) of the awarded CRR Auction offers, while observing all applicable constraints.
(6)	The CRR Network Model must, to the extent practicable, reflect the continuous and post-contingency system operating limits and operational procedures (i.e., Remedial Action Schemes (RASs), Automatic Mitigation Plans (AMPs) and Remedial Action Plans (RAPs)) in the Network Operations Model used by ERCOT during Real-Time operations, as discussed below in Section 7.5.5.4, Simultaneous Feasibility Test.
(7)	Once a CRR Auction is complete, ERCOT shall archive and keep the CRR Auction system and all models used to finalize the CRR Auction results under ERCOT’s data retention policy as that policy applies to data that may be needed to resolve requests for billing adjustments under applicable billing adjustment procedures.
(8)	Once a CRR Auction is complete, ERCOT will make available on the MIS Certified Area each active CRR Account Holder’s credit exposure calculated within the CRR Auction process (as defined in paragraph (3) above).
7.5.5.4	Simultaneous Feasibility Test
(1)	The Simultaneous Feasibility Test (SFT) is a market feasibility test that confirms that the transmission system can support the awarded set of CRRs during normal system conditions, assuming that the Network Operations Model updated with Real-Time network topology is the same as that modeled (for the CRR Auction), while observing all security constraints.    
(2)	The SFT uses a Direct Current (DC) power-flow model to model the effect of CRR Auction bids and offers on the expected system network topology during the auction term.  SFT is not a system reliability test and is not intended to model actual system operating conditions.  SFTs are run during the determination of the winning bids and offers for the CRR Auction.
(3)	Inputs to the SFT model include:
(a)	CRR bids and offers for the auction;
(b)	All previously awarded or allocated CRRs for each month;
(c)	Transmission line Outage schedules;
(d)	Expected configuration of Transmission Facilities, adjusted for oversold CRRs, as specified in paragraph (e) below;
(e)	Increased capacity of each element that has been oversold in prior CRR Auctions and CRR allocations to exactly match the amount of CRRs that have been sold or allocated on that element (this ensures the feasibility of the CRR Auction);
(f)	Thermal operating limits (including estimates for Dynamic Ratings) for transmission lines;
(i)	For a CRR Long-Term Auction Sequence, ERCOT shall use Dynamic Ratings based on a historical analysis of the maximum peak-hour temperatures for the previous ten years; and 
(ii)	For the CRR Monthly Auction, ERCOT shall use Dynamic Ratings for the maximum peak-hour temperature forecast for the month;  
(g)	Voltage and stability limits that are valid for the study period converted to thermal limits;
(h)	ERCOT Transmission Grid pre- and post-contingency ratings;
(i)	All Transmission Element contingencies expected to be used by ERCOT in Real-Time operations; and
(j)	RAPs, AMPs, and RASs.

7.5.7	Method for Distributing CRR Auction Revenues
(1)	ERCOT shall determine, for each month, the CRR Monthly Revenues (CMRs).  The CMR is the sum of:
(a)	Monthly CRR revenue for that month; and
(b)	PCRR revenues.
(2)	ERCOT shall credit the net CRR Auction revenue (including PCRR revenue) produced from CRRs cleared in each CRR Auction that source from a Settlement Point located within a 2003 ERCOT CMZ and sink at a Settlement Point located within the same 2003 ERCOT CMZ to Qualified Scheduling Entities (QSEs) in the 2003 ERCOT CMZ on a zonal Load Ratio Share (LRS) basis.  All other net CRR Auction revenues must be allocated to QSEs on an ERCOT-wide LRS basis.  For these allocation purposes, any Non-Opt-In Entity (NOIE) Load Zone is considered to be located entirely within the 2003 ERCOT CMZ that represented the largest Load for that NOIE or group of NOIEs in 2003.

m	none	A month.
q	none	A QSE.
o	none	A CRR Owner.
[NPRR1030:  Replace paragraph (2) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(2)	The credit to each QSE representing LSEs for a given month is calculated as follows:
LACRRAMT q       =	(-1) * (CRRDC q + CRRNDC q)
Where:
CRRNDC q       =	(CRRALLOCTOT –  CRRDC q ) * MLRS q
CRRDC q           = 	CRRALLOCTOT * DCMLRS q
CRRALLOCTOT       =	Max ((CRRBACRTOT + CRRFEETOT + CRRRAMTTOT) – (FUNDCAP – CRRBAFBBAL), 0)
CRRRAMTTOT    =	 CRRRAMT o
The above variables are defined as follows:
Variable	Unit	Definition
LACRRAMT q	$	Load-Allocated CRR Amount per QSE—The allocated surplus from the CRR Balancing Account and CRR Auction PTP Option Award Charge Total at the end of the month to QSE q with Loads and Direct Current Tie (DC Tie) exports.

MLRS q	none	Monthly Load Ratio Share per QSE — The ratio share of Loads excluding DC Tie exports for QSE q, for the peak Load 15-minute Settlement Interval in the month.
q	none	A QSE.
o	none	A CRR Owner.
7.9.3.6	Rolling CRR Balancing Account Fund
(1)	ERCOT shall establish a rolling CRR Balancing Account Fund (CRRBAF) as follows:
(a)	The CRRBAF shall be funded beginning in the first month after implementation and every month that the CRR Balancing Account credit exceeds monthly CRR shortfalls.
(b)	The CRRBAF calculated for a month shall not exceed the CRR Balancing Account Fund Cap.
(c)	The CRRBAF shall refund to LSEs any surplus above the fund cap.
(d)	In the event that a resettlement of the CRR Balancing Account is required, the CRRBAF for the resettlement will be calculated using the CRRBAF at the end of the previous month from the date of the resettlement invoice.   
(e)	The end of the month CRRBAF is calculated as follows:
	If CRRBACRTOT + CRRFEETOT < CRRSAMTTOT:
CRRBAF m	=	CRRBAFBBAL - CRRBAFA m 
Otherwise if CRRBACRTOT + CRRFEETOT > CRRSAMTTOT and CRRBAF < FUNDCAP:
CRRBAF m           	=	CRRBAFBBAL + (CRRBACRTOT + CRRFEETOT – CRRSAMTTOT) + LACRRAMTTOT
Where:
LACRRAMTTOT 	= 	  LACRRAMT q
The above variables are defined as follows:
Variable	Unit	Definition
CRRBACRTOT
