generator (greater than 10 MW) terminal buses shall be modeled in the SSWG Cases. Each bus record has a bus number, name, base kV, bus type code, area number, zone number, per-unit bus nominal voltage magnitude, bus voltage phase angle, and owner number. Reactive resources shall be modeled in either the fixed shunt table or the switched shunt table and shall not be modeled in any bus record.  
4.1.2	Bus Number Ranges
The ERCOT transmission system is modeled within the full PSS®E bus number range (1 through 999,997). The Chairman of the SSWG allocates bus ranges, new or amended, with confirmation from the SSWG members.  Each TSP represents their network in the SSWG Cases within the TSP’s designated bus number range. ERCOT represents Resource Entities (REs) and Private Use Networks (PUNs) in the SSWG Cases within ERCOT’s designated bus number range.  Bus number range assignments are listed in the Bus/Zone Range Table in Appendix A.
4.1.3	Bus Names 
Bus names shall not identify the custo
