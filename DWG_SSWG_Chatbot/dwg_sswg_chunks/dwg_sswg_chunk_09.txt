4.4	Branch Data
4.4.1	Use of Branch Record Data Fields
All existing and planned transmission lines (60 kV and above) shall be modeled in the SSWG Cases.
4.4.1.1	Bus Specifications 
The end points of each branch in the SSWG Cases are specified by “from” and “to” bus numbers.  In most cases the end point buses are in the same TSP area.  However, when the “from” and “to” buses used to specify a branch are in different TSP areas, the branch is considered to be a tie line (See Section 4.4.3, Coordination of Tie Lines). Branch data includes exactly two buses. The end points of Multi-Section Lines (MSL) are defined by two buses specified in a branch data record (See Section 4.4.2). There are other components that are modeled with more than two buses, such as transformers with tertiary that may be represented by three-bus models. 
4.4.1.2	Branch Circuit Identifier 
Circuit identifiers are limited to two alphanumeric characters.  Each TSP will determine its own naming convention for circuit identifiers.  ERCOT will determine its own naming convention for branches owned by REs and PUNs with careful coordination with connected TSPs.  These identifiers are typically numeric values (e.g. 1 or 2) that indicate the number of branches between two common buses, but many exceptions exist. 
4.4.1.3	Branch Impedance and Admittance Data
The branch resistance, reactance, and admittance data contained in the SSWG Cases are expressed in per-unit quantities that are calculated from a base impedance. The base impedance for transmission lines is calculated from the system base MVA and the base voltage of the transmission branch of interest.  The system base MVA used in the SSWG Cases is 100 MVA (S = 100 MVA).  The base voltage for a transmission line branch is the nominal line-to-line voltage of that particular transmission branch (See Transformer Data for Calculation of Transformer Impedances). Therefore the base impedance used for calculating transmission branch impedances is:

  Ohms
This base impedance is then used to convert the physical quantities of the transmission line into per-unit values to be used in the SSWG Cases.
4.4.1.3.1	Resistance
Once the total transmission line resistance is known and expressed in ohms, then this value is divided by the base impedance to obtain the per-unit resistance to be used in the SSWG Cases.  This calculation is as follows:
  
4.4.1.3.2	Reactance
Once the total transmission line reactance is known and expressed in ohms, then this value is divided by the base impedance to obtain the per-unit reactance to be used in the SSWG Cases.  This calculation is as follows:
  
4.4.1.3.3	Admittance
Branch admittance is expressed as total branch charging susceptance in per unit on the 100 MVA system base.  The total branch charging is expressed in MVARs and divided by the system base MVA to get per unit charging.  The equation used to accomplish this depends on the starting point. Typically the charging of a transmission line is known in KVARs.  Given the total transmission line charging expressed in KVARs, the equation to calculate the total branch charging susceptance in per unit on the system base is as follows:
  

Or, given the total capacitive reactance to neutral expressed in ohms  , the equation to calculate the total branch charging susceptance in per unit on the system base is as follows:

 

 
4.4.1.4	Facility Ratings
SSWG Cases contain fields for five ratings for each branch record, including zero impedance branches.  The ratings associated with these five fields are commonly referred to as Rate 1, Rate 2, Rate 3, Rate 4, and Rate 5.  Each TSP has their own methodology for calculating these ratings and shall be made available to others within ERCOT upon request. Following are the SSWG Case facility ratings corresponding to the ratings defined in Nodal Protocol 2.1:

Planning Case Rating Definitions	Corresponding Nodal Protocol Section 2.1 Definitions
Rate 1	Normal Rating
Rate 2	Emergency Rating
Rate 3	 15-Minute Rating
Rate 4	Transformer 2-Hour/Branch Conductor Rating
Rate 5	Relay Loadability Rating

By definition, Rate 5 ≥ Rate 3 ≥ Rate 2 ≥ Rate 1 and Rate 4 ≥ Rate 2 ≥ Rate 1.

When performing security studies, ERCOT will default to Rate 2, unless the TSP has previously indicated in writing that other ratings (e.g., Rate 1) should be used.  If problems exist using Rate 2 and Rate 2 is significantly different from Rate 4, then ERCOT will contact the TSP. There may also be 8888 or 9999 ratings in the SSWG Cases. The 8888 rating represents items such as change of ownership at a substation facility, a radial Point Of Interconnect to a custome
