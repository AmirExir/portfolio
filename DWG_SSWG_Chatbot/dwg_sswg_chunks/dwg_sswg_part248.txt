ommended DWG Study Methodologies 
Note: This section addresses, in part, requirements R4, R5 and R6 of NERC Standard TPL-001-4 and TPL-001-5.1 (effective July 1, 2023).
Voltage stability margin, transient voltage criteria, and damping criteria are described in the ERCOT Planning Guide Section 4.  
	Voltage Instability Identification in Stability Studies
Voltage Instability is indicated by severely low bus voltage or bus voltage collapse. 
Voltage Instability could cause: 
	Motor stalling leading to significant amount of customer initiated motor tripping.
	Loss of generator(s) due to low voltage 
	Voltage collapse of an area
	Cascading Identification in Stability Studies
Cascading Definition - Cascading is defined as the uncontrolled loss of any system facilities or load, whether because of thermal overload, voltage collapse, or loss of synchronism, except those occurring as a result of fault isolation. Cascading is indicated by one or more of the following conditions:
	Uncontrolled seq
