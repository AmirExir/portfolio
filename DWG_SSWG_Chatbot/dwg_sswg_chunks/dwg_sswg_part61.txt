scheduled voltages should reflect actual voltage set points used by the generator operators. 
	TSPs should check the voltages at several key locations within the system when modifying generation control voltages and reactive devices.  Voltage profile changes can be accomplished by turning on/turning off capacitors or reactors, and by changing the operations of generators (turning on/turning off/redispatching for VAR control). The cases should ultimately model system voltages that could be reasonably expected to occur.
