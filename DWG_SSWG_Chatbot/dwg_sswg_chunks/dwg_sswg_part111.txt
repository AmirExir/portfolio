General Data Entry Checks

Error Message	Reason for Failing Data Validation
Duplicate	The device is listed more than once in the contingency definition.
Needs Consistent Name	For each unique TOContingencyID, only one ContingencyName can be used. 
Invalid Date Selection	Either the start and/or stop dates for a single contingency definition are inconsistent or the start date occurs after the stop date.  In the case where a single contingency definition has inconsistent start dates, use the one that occurs furthest in the future since the contingency definition will not be valid until all devices listed in the contingency are present in the base case.  The start date is used to determine when the contingency definition becomes validâ€”it is not the energization date for the device listed on that row.
Invalid Bus Selection	The same bus number is used twice in the same row, or a needed bus number is missing.
Invalid Element Identifier	Element Identifier is invalid.
