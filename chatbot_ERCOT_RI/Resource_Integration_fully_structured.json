When revisions to this document are made by ERCOT, a market notice will be posted on the Market Information System and the updated document will be posted to the ERCOT website.\t\nLink to the Resource Integration Page:  https://www.ercot.com/services/rq/integration. \nGeneration Interconnection Overview \nAll entities that own generation connected to the ERCOT System at or above 1 MW must be registered as a Resource Entity (RE). The RE must register each generator through the ERCOT registration process by submitting the required data using the applicable resource registration process. The resource registration process incorporates electronic and manual processes to submit, validate, and approve the resource data that is used in planning, market and operations systems as defined in the ERCOT Protocols and Market Guides.\nConnecting new or modified generation to the grid requires that QSEs, REs, IEs and TSPs provide ERCOT with accurate engineering models and telemetry of the new or modified generator and all associated transmission facilities as required for the Network Operations Model.  Adding information to the ERCOT Network Operations Model is controlled by protocol 3.10. The registration and modeling process ensures that data submitted by equipment owners is accurately modeled and that communications between ERCOT systems and the new generator\u2019s systems through the QSE are in place before the new or modified generation is commissioned.\nDuring the interconnection process, the ERCOT Resource Integration department is the primary contact for an Interconnecting Entity (IE). ERCOT Resource Integration is responsible for tracking each generator through the stages of the interconnection process and facilitating interactions between ERCOT, TSPs and REs as well as resolution of any issues that may arise. Each RE is assigned an Account Manager upon registration as a Market Participant who serves as its primary contact for operational interactions with ERCOT after commissioning.  Account Managers will guide each RE through its preparations for market operations while the IE completes the interconnection process as the generator is energized, synchronized, and approved as ready to be commissioned for participation in the ERCOT market.\nERCOT will work with the IE to establish the Production Load Date (PLD) which is based on the Initial Energization date of the Point of Interconnection (POI) and the Initial Synchronization date of the generator. The energization date of the POI needs to be coordinated with the TSP\u2019s PLD for their side of the POI to allow time to resolve issues with telemetry or other operational issues before synchronization.  The POI must be a new or existing station with breakers (no hard taps) capable of interrupting fault current to sectionalize the transmission lines connecting the station to the rest of the ERCOT System.  The POI must also be connected to the ERCOT System where there are breakers and not, for example, connected to an existing line that is tapped off another transmission line.  \nERCOT recommends that the potential RE register as a Market Participant at least 140 days prior to the date that the new or modified generator is to be added to the Network Operations Model (PLD). The Resource Entity should also complete the fields required for full registration in RIOO-IS Substation Details for the Network Operations Model at least 120 days prior to the desired Production Load Date (PLD) and inform ERCOT that it had been submitted to allow time for revisions to help ensure being able to meet the submittal date for the PLD shown in Protocol 3.10.1.\u2003\nGeneration Interconnection Process Overview\nThe generation interconnection process described in this handbook has been divided into the following three stages for the purpose of defining the interactions between the developer/owner of the generation resource, ERCOT and TSPs:\n\nStage 1:  Interconnection Request Application to Quarterly Stability Assessment\nStage 2:  Registration and Modeling\nStage 3:  Energization, Synchronization and Commissioning\n\t\tFigure 1: Generation Resource Interconnection Process Flow\n \nIn Stage 1, the IE submits a GIM application to ERCOT for any generation that meets the applicability requirements in section 5.2.1 of the ERCOT Planning Guides using RIOO-IS.  ERCOT will review the RIOO submittal and accept or return the application within 10 business days after which the status of the GIM will change to \u201cIn Progress\u201d or \u201dPlanned\u201d (See Table 1, the IE will see the status of \u201cIn Progress\u201d while ERCOT will see the status of \u201cPlanned\u201d).  ERCOT will conduct a Security Screening Study (SSS) to evaluate the proposed generator\u2019s effect on the ERCOT transmission system. ERCOT will post the SSS to the RIOO system upon completion.  Prior to or no later than 180 days after completion of the SSS, the IE will submit a RIOO change request to attach the Proof of Site Control and enter the Energization, Sychronization, and Commercial Operations Date along with the required data in Substation Details to initiate the Full Interconnection Study process that is performed by the TSP owning the POI facilities.  The IE shall inform ERCOT by email when the data required for the FIS has been submitted.  If the IE does not request the FIS within 180 days of the date ERCOT notifies the IE of the Security Screening Study results, the GIM (GINR) application will be considered withdrawn by the IE and cancelled by ERCOT.\nOnce all FIS studies are completed, a Standard Generation Interconnection Agreement must be executed with the TSP within 180 days for the GIM to continue. Failure to meet this requirement will result in cancellation of the GIM by ERCOT.  Upon completion of the SGIA, generation data required by the Resource Registration Glossary \u2013 Planning Model column shall be supplied by the IE to ERCOT using RIOO-IS. The IE shall provide to the TSP the Notice to Proceed with construction and the full financial security required to fund the interconnection and the TSP will provide these dates in RIOO-IS.  The IE must also provide the Department of Defense Notification attestation in RIOO-IS. ERCOT then models the new generation in planning base cases built by the Steady State Working Group (SSWG) once it meets Planning Guide section 6.9.\nOnce the Interconnecting Entity meets Planning Guide section 6.9, ERCOT performs a Compliance with Operational Standards review in accordance with Protocol 16.5 (3) to determine if the generator can fully comply with ERCOT Operating Standards based on the submitted FIS, SGIA and resource data.  The Quarterly Stability Assessment is used to assess the stability impact of the proposed resource alongside other resources that are synchronizing in the same quarter and determine if mitigation plans are needed before the generator is allowed to synchronize to the ERCOT system.   \nIn Stage 2, the Resource Entity registers as a Market Participant with ERCOT. Once registered, the Resource Entity is responsible for registering the generator by submitting the resource data required by the Resource Registration Glossary \u2013 Full Registration column in RIOO-IS.  ERCOT models the new generator in the Network Operations Model from the resource data supplied to reflect the addition of the new generation and related facilities. The RE will need to coordinate with the TSP to make sure the TSP facilities are also modeled for the same PLD.\nERCOT will also review the proposed telemetry points list required to establish real-time communication and control between ERCOT and the QSE. ERCOT works directly with the TSPs and REs to establish the necessary ERCOT Polled Settlement (EPS) meter communication points which allows gathering of 15-minute data for settlements.\nIn Stage 3, ERCOT reviews the generator\u2019s Commissioning Plan Template, and approves the following 3 checklist parts described in the New Generator Commissioning Checklist:\n\u2022\tPart 1:  Request to Energize\n\u2022\tPart 2:  Request for Initial Synchronization (or Parts 2a and 2b for WGR\u2019s meeting applicability of Planning Guide section 5.2.1(1)(c)(ii).\n\u2022\tPart 3:  Request to Commission a Resource\nFor the generator to be commissioned and approved for participation in ERCOT market operations, it must demonstrate that it can satisfy ERCOT\u2019s requirements for Reactive Power (both leading and lagging), Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR), Primary Frequency Response (PFR), Power System Stabilizer (PSS), and follow SCED instructions as applicable to the generation type and registration.\nSee the Normal and Fast timelines in appendices D and E.\nIE sign up guide:  https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2022/01/14/IE-SignUp-Guide-for-RIOO-Services.pdf\nRE sign up guide:  https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2022/01/14/RE-SignUp-Guide-for-RIOO-Services.pdf\nTDSP sign up guide:  https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2022/01/14/TSP-Sign-Up-for-RIOO-Services.pdf\nManaging your RIOO account:  https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2022/01/14/Managing-Your-RIOO-Services-User-Account.pdf\nSTAGE 1 \u2013 Generation Interconnection Request Application to QSA\nExamples of Applicability (Planning Guide Section 5):  1 - 9.99 MW is Small Gen, 10+ MW is Large Gen.\nGeneration Interconnection or Change Request Application and Fees\nAll IEs seeking to interconnect new generation or modify existing generation connected to the ERCOT system 1 MW or greater in accordance with Planning Guide section 5.2.1 are required to follow the Generation Interconnection or Modification (GIM) process.  \nTo begin the GIM process and initiate the Security Screening Study or a simultaneous Security Screening Study and Full Interconnect Study, IEs must initiate an application using the RIOO-IS system.  Information on RIOO-IS access and use can be found on-line as shown with the numbered icons below.\n1.\tFigure 1 shows how to launch the RIOO-IS application.  Best browser to use is Chrome.\n2.\tFigure 2 shows Related content to help IEs and TSPs sign-up to create an account and to use the application with user guides specific to IEs and TSPs.  Note that TSPs must follow the RIOO-IS TSP Sign-Up Reference very carefully to create a TSP account which will allow them to see all GIM (GINR)s.\nFigure 1  ERCOT.com bottom of page link to launch RIOO-IS\nFigure 2:  Resource Integration page for related content to help IE\u2019s and TSP\u2019s\nIEs should see a page like that below if they have signed up correctly.  Note the \u201cStart New INR Request\u201d button in the top right.  TSPs should not see this button and if they do, they should submit an ERCOT Helpdesk ticket to remove their Auth0 account.  The \u201cStart New INR Request\u201d button is a drop down with a choice to start as either an IE or a RE.  Load Resources need to start as a RE, as should Small Generation projects because they will need to submit a full registration RARF right away.\nFigure 3:  IE RIOO page after signing in After clicking the \u201cStart New INR Request\u201d button, IEs should see the following screen showing the action items to choose the size and whether the connection will be transmission or distribution.  \nFigure 4: The IE screen to start an INR.  Choose the size of your project \nRE\u2019s will see a similar screen, but first will have to select the company that they want to use to create the INR if more than one company is listed.  For a company to be listed, a RE will need to have the role RIOORS_M_OPERATOR listed in their MPIM for the companies DUNS number.  Contact your USA to have that role added.\nFigure 5 The RE screen to start an INR, select the company from the drop down and choose the size of your project \nFigure 6 Once the size is chosen, new options appear\nFrom the initial GIM (GINR) application submittal until the IE is assigned a Resource Integration (RI) Engineer, IEs should direct questions about the generator interconnection or change process itself or primary contact changes to  ResourceIntegrationDepartment@ercot.com.  RIOO-IS access issues should be submitted to the ERCOT Helpdesk or RIOO-HELP@ercot.com.  \nWhen an ERCOT RI Engineer is assigned to the GIM (GINR) application, the RI Engineer will notify the IE with their contact information and inform them that they will oversee their interconnection application and be available to answer questions. \n \nFigure 7 MW Size Entry\nThe MW values entered into the Maximum Generator MW, Maximum Summer Generator MW, and Maximum Winter Generator MW in the RIOO-IS screen above should be the MW value at the generator terminals as modeled in the ERCOT Network Operations Model (typically 34.5 kV bus for IRRs and IBRs), not the Point of Interconnection Bus.  For projects meeting PG 5.2.1(1)(c)(ii), the Maximum and Maximum Summer Generator MW are the same (except for thermal units) and the Maximum Winter Generator MW is set to the delta MW value caused by the changes being done in the project.\nERCOT will notify the IE within 10 Business days if any part of the application requirements are not complete or the appropriate fee was not submitted. ERCOT will immediately contact the IE if more information is needed, and the IE will have 10 Business Days to respond without impacting the timeline.  If the IE does not respond within 10 Business Days, ERCOT shall notify the IE that the request has been deemed incomplete and rejected. \nWhen the application is deemed complete, ERCOT will change the status of the completed GIM (GINR) application within 10 Business Days to \u201cIn progress\u201d/\u201dPlanned\u201d.  The IE will see the status of \u201cIn Progress\u201d, while ERCOT will see the status of \u201cPlanned\u201d.  Other statuses are shown in the table below:\n\t(Changed from new) - is in the status of new until ERCOT coordinator moves it to incomplete. \n\u2022\t \u2013 with a credit card and we have automatic confirmed payment\n\u2022\t \u2013 is manually reconciled by the coordinator. The coordinator will have access to the banking system and can move the INR to incomplete when the check clears.  \n \u2013 this is an ERCOT internal status when in this status we display to the IE the following labels instead:\n\u2022\t on Your INR Request \u2013 when ERCOT requested a change from the IE using the toggle button in the ERCOT information section of the INR review\n\u2022\tSubmitted to ERCOT\u2013 otherwise it says submitted during ERCOT review of paperwork\n\u2013 stays in planned until it is commissioned, canceled, or suspended during a sale.

The project is Inactive.\nCanceled \u2013 is displayed when an INR is canceled\nOperational \u2013 is displayed when ERCOT changes the status to operational.\nTable 1: ERCOT/IE Status Mapping \nGIM (GINR) Applications for Multiple Technology Types\nSeparate GIM applications should be submitted for each technology type in the interconnection request.  For example, if an interconnection request includes solar and battery facilities, two GIM applications should be submitted.  ERCOT and the interconnecting TSP will hold a single FIS kickoff meeting for both INR numbers and the IE and the TSP may sign a single SGIA referring to both INR numbers.  Both GIMs will be included in the SSS and FIS.\nGIM (GINR) Applications for Multiple Project Phases or Long Commissioning \nA separate GIM application should be submitted for Projects being built in phases or over a long period of time.  ERCOT desires the time between Initial Synchronization and Resource Commissioning Date to be 120 days or less.  Projects requiring more time should be split into separate GIM\u2019s as soon as it is first known.  \nFor projects requiring multiple INR numbers, the IE must ensure that each of the modeled generator\u2019s capacity at a given point in time is completely contained in a single INR number.  It is expected that all modeled generators whose capacity is included in the same INR number must all be approved for Resource Commissioning (Part 3) on the same day.\nLone Star Infrastructure Protection Act RFI \nDuring the initial application stage for both Small and Large generation, the following screen will appear.    The blue text concerning the Lone Star Infrastructure Protection Act can be ignored as an attestation will have to be e-signed later in the process before payment.\nFigure 8:  The text in the blue box can be ignored concerning the Lone Star Infrastructure Protection Act Screen\nSecurity Screening Study\nFor each GIM request submitted, ERCOT will conduct a high-level, steady-state Security Screening Study (SSS), including power-flow and transfer studies, based on the proposed Commercial Operation Date (COD) and a single Point of Interconnection (POI).  The main purpose of the study is to provide an indication of the level at which the proposed generation can expect to operate simultaneously with other known generation in the area before significant transmission additions or enhancements may be required.\nERCOT is allowed 90 days to perform the Screening Study.  During this time, ERCOT will contact the IE if additional information is needed, and the IE will have 10 Business Days to respond without impacting the study timeline.\nDuring the Security Screening Study, ERCOT may consult with affected TSPs to identify the most efficient means of providing transmission service.  The TSP may suggest an alternate POI which will be allowed and not force the IE to submit another GIM.\nUpon completion of the Security Screening Study, ERCOT will share the report with the IE using the RIOO-IS system.  The report shall indicate study assumptions, transfer analysis results, and whether a SSR study is required.  See below for more information on SSR.\nWhen a GIM is \u201cCancelled\u201d by ERCOT or \u201cWithdrawn\u201d by the IE, if the IE desires to proceed with the project at a later date, they must submit a new GIM application.  The IE may use INACTIVE status to gain time once the FIS has been completed.\nFull Interconnection Study (FIS) \nWithin 180 days of the date ERCOT notifies the IE of the SSS results, the IE must begin the FIS Request process to indicate its desire to pursue a Full Interconnection Study, or the GIM will be cancelled.  This is done by:\n1.\t Submitting a change request on the RIOO-IS system to add the \na.\tEnergization date\nb.\tSynchronization date \nc.\tAttach the proof of site control\nd.\tIf a MW size change is desired, change the MW size of your project and wait for this CR to be approved before proceeding to step 2.\n2.\tEntering the required resource data required for the FIS Proof of Site Control and resource data with data required by the Resource Registration Glossary \u2013 Full Interconnect Study (FIS)\nAfter accepting the change request containing the proof of site control attachment and reviewing the resource data submitted by the IE, ERCOT will check the submissions and approve the FIS Application.  When the FIS Application is approved, RIOO-IS will generate an email to the Lead TSP to begin initiation and coordination of the FIS Kick-off meeting. \nIMPORTANT:  If you plan to reduce or increase the MW size of your project, it must be done before entry of Resource data for the FIS.  Change the MW size with the CR to change the dates and add proof of site control.  Payment will not reflect the new size if this CR is not submitted and approved by ERCOT.\nFigure 9: To request a FIS study, click \u201cAdd a Change Request\u201d in the Basic Project Information block to enter the Energization and Synchronization dates and attach the proof of site control. The resource data also needs to be added by clicking the \u201cLet\u2019s get Started\u201d button in the Substation Details block.\nThe IE can begin the FIS Request by entering data for only the Steady State study, Short Circuit study, or the Stability and Dynamics study or any combination of the three studies.  RIOO will then indicate each data field that is required for the chosen Level of Commitment (LOC).\nFigure 10 RIOO screen to select Level of Comittment\nFigure 11 RIOO Screen showing the data fields required for the chosen level of comittment\nThe IE will pay FIS fees to both ERCOT using RIOO-IS, as specified in the ERCOT Fee Schedule, and to the TSP performing the studies in accordance with an agreement with the TSP.  Fees paid to the TSP should be agreed on and specified in the FIS Scope Agreement.  ERCOT is not a party to the FIS Scope Agreement.\nAs discussed in Section 5 of the Planning Guide, the FIS process consists of a set of steady-state, dynamic, short-circuit, and facility studies.  The FIS studies are not intended to ensure the deliverability of power from the proposed generation to the market or to ensure that the proposed generation does not experience any congestion-related curtailments in real-time.\nBecause the FIS is generally the critical path item in the GIM process with no defined length to complete, ERCOT recommends that a timetable for the FIS be developed and included in the FIS study scope agreement.  \nSee Planning Guide section 5.3.2, Full Interconnection Study Request, for more information regarding the FIS.\nFIS Scope Meeting \nWithin 10 Business Days of receiving the RIOO-IS data required to proceed with the FIS from the IE, ERCOT will designate the lead TSP for the FIS.  The selection of the lead TSP will be based upon a preliminary analysis of the most likely Point of Interconnection (POI).  The lead TSP will then arrange a FIS kick-off meeting with ERCOT, the IE and other TSPs desiring to participate in the study.  During the meeting, the IE will discuss the GIM application and the TSP will discuss the overall scope, timetable of activities, studies being performed, anticipated facilities needed, etc.  ERCOT will discuss the Security Screening Study results.\nThe date of the FIS kick-off meeting starts the 60-calendar day clock within which the IE and TSP should reach an agreement on the FIS scope.  ERCOT will attempt to mediate if an agreement cannot be reached within that period.  After the 60-day period, if no agreement is reached, the GIM may be terminated.   \nFIS Study Process\nBased on the overall scope established during the FIS kick-off meeting, the lead TSP shall use the data provided by ERCOT and the IE to develop and study the existing and future ERCOT system to determine the generator\u2019s reliability impact at the proposed POI.  The TSP(s) will examine normal transmission operating conditions as well as potentially adverse, or contingency, conditions. \nIn comparing interconnection alternatives, the TSP(s) will consider such information as interconnection cost and construction schedule, impact to short and long-range reliability, operational flexibility, and compatibility with future transmission plans. The TSP(s) may also consider interconnection alternatives not suggested by the IE or ERCOT.  ERCOT will perform an independent Economic Study for informational purposes if the TSP determines in the facility study that the estimated transmission interconnection costs could exceed $25 million dollars.\nFollowing the completion and review of the FIS studies by the TSPs and approval by ERCOT, the report will be deemed complete, and the IE and TSP may execute a SGIA.\nSubsynchronous Resonance Study (SSR)\nThe ERCOT Protocols section 3.22 contains detailed definitions and information pertaining to the Subsynchronous Resonance, countermeasure, protection, mitigation, etc. terminology used in this section.\nIf ERCOT determines during the Security Screening Study topology-check that the generator may be vulnerable to SSR, the lead TSP shall be notified that a SSR study is required.  The SSR study scope will be shared between ERCOT, TSPs and the IE and discussed during the FIS kick-off meeting, but the study itself is not part of the FIS.  \nERCOT will review the SSR study for approval.  If the study results determine that the Resource is vulnerable to SSR, the IE shall be responsible for either installing the appropriate SSR countermeasures or developing a SSR Mitigation Plan.

    "text": "Standard Generation Interconnection Agreement (SGIA)\nShould the IE decide to proceed with the construction and completion of the proposed generation project, they shall execute a SGIA with the respective TSP.  ERCOT is not a party to the agreement.\nThe SGIA must be signed by all parties within 180 days following the completion of the FIS or, following notification by ERCOT, the GIM will be cancelled unless the IE requests and is granted an exception before expiration of the 180 days.  The exception will require that work has begun on the IA by both the IE and TSP and is confirmed by email by the TSP.\nIn certain situations, the IE and the TSP may agree to allow the TSP to begin design or construction of facilities prior to the execution of the SGIA, or to allow the IE to delay issuing a Notice to Proceed until sometime after the SGIA is signed.\nPlanning Guide section 6.9\nMeeting the requirements of Planning Guide section 6.9 is an important milestone in the GIM process.  It is required to qualify for entry in the Quarterly Stability Assessment (QSA) and for submittal into the Network Operations Model.  It is also required to begin the Protocol section 16.5 Compliance with Operational Standards Review which will be reviewed prior to Initial Synchronization of the generator.  Generator\u2019s designated as a small generator need to meet P.G. 6.9(3).\nReactive Study Requirements\nThe Interconnecting Entity is required to submit to ERCOT a reactive study that provides an engineering analysis of the reactive capability of the proposed interconnected generation facilities. This study shall include the list of equipment and systems that are to be installed to meet ERCOT reactive support requirements. It is recommended that the Interconnecting Entity incorporate in their project plan at least one month for ERCOT to review and approve the study with consideration for lead-time necessary for procurement of associated equipment. New generation facilities adding reactive equipment, in addition to the generation\u2019s reactive capability specified in the ERCOT approved reactive study, shall have the reactive equipment installed in the field and ready to be placed in service at the time of Initial Synchronization. Protocol Section 3.15 Voltage Support provides more information about reactive requirements.\nThe Reactive Study is a requirement for the Quarterly Stability Assessment (QSA). \nCompliance with Operational Standards Review\nAfter the SGIA is signed and Planning Guide section 6.9 is met, ERCOT will begin the Protocol section 16.5 (3) review and assess whether the proposed generator would violate any operational standards as established in the Protocols, Operating Guides, Market Guides or Other Binding Documents.  \nERCOT has 90-days from the date that PG 6.9 was met to complete its review and provide the IE a written determination of whether the proposed system design complies with the operational standards. \nIf, based on the information contained in the FIS, IA, RARF and other submitted data, ERCOT determines that the Resource does not meet, or cannot determine whether the Resource will meet, the operational standards, ERCOT will provide a written document to the IE explaining the determination.  Additional data may have to be provided to ERCOT by updating the RARF or other required studies or documents.  Final determination of compliance with operational standards will occur during the Stage 3 process and is needed prior to synchronization.\nQuarterly Stability Assessment (QSA)\nERCOT conducts a stability assessment every three months to assess the impact of planned new or modified generation proposing to synchronize to the ERCOT System five to seven months in the future as shown in PG 5.3.5, ERCOT Quarterly Stability Assessment, and repeated in the table below.  The QSA assesses the impact of proposed generation and determines if mitigation plans are required before the generator can synchronize to the ERCOT grid.\nGeneration not included in the quarter shown in the Initial Synchronization Quarter column in the table below will not be eligible for Initial Synchronization during that three-month period:\nGeneration Resource Initial Synchronization Quarter\tLast Day for an IE to meet prerequisites as listed below\tCompletion of Quarterly Stability Assessment\nUpcoming January, February, March\tPrior August 1\tEnd of October\nUpcoming April, May, June\tPrior November 1\tEnd of January\nUpcoming July, August, September\tPrior February 1\tEnd of April\nUpcoming October, November, December\tPrior May 1\tEnd of July\nThe IE must have met the following requirements before being allowed to synchronize new or modified generation: \n\u2022\tCompleted the requirements of Planning Guide Section 6.9, Addition of Proposed Generation to the Planning Models. \n\u2022\tCompleted the following: \n\u2022\tFIS studies; \n\u2022\tReactive Power Study; \n\u2022\tSSR study if required;\n\u2022\tSystem improvements or mitigation plans that were identified in studies\n\u2022\tInitial Compliance with Operational Standards review.\nThe summary results of the Quarterly Assessment will be posted to the MIS within ten days of completion.  Please refer to Planning Guide section 5.3.5 for detailed information pertaining to the QSA process. \nSmall Generation Process:\nThe Small Generation process is governed by Planning Guide Section 5.4.  \nA flow chart with more details of the Small Generation process flow is in Appendix H.  An example of the Small Gen Checklist is in Appendix K.\nRIOO-IS Small Generation Initial Application Checks:\n\u2022\tOne-line diagram (Need the Load Transformer name on the One-Line)\n\u2022\tValid Load/Load Transformer information in RIOO-IS \n\u2022\tSite Photos, .kmz files, and/or Maps \n\u2022\tProof of Site Control\n\u2022\tSigned Declaration of Department of Defense (DOD) Notification \n\u2022\tPayment for Small Gen application  \nSmall Generator Review Meetings.  \nThese meetings are optional but are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for new IEs or for an IE submitting a Small Generation application for the first time. The IE must request these meetings for any Small Generator interconnection request if they desire a meeting.  (These are optional as per Planning Guide Section 5.4.1) \nSmall Gen Application Information (Planning Guide 5.4):\nIn addition to the above items, the following items / studies are required to submit the full Registration Level RARF in accordance with PG 5.4.3, Review and Approval to Submit Model Information. Please coordinate with your TDSP:\n\u2022\tInitial RARF \u2013 Uploaded to RIOO by IE/RE (See the RARF Glossary for all required fields and data for Registration purposes)\n\u2022\tInclude the TDSP Station Name and Code for the Resource Site Name/Code in the General Site ESIID Form.

Power Generation Companies operating within Texas are also required to register with the Public Utility Commission of Texas in accordance with PUCT Substantive rules which may be found at http://www.puc.texas.gov/.\nThe ERCOT account manager assigned to each RE will assist the applicant with registering as a Resource Entity.  The process generally takes 10 to 15 Business Days and is comprised of the following key submissions which may be found at ercot.com on the Registration & Qualification webpages:\n\u2022\tStandard Form Market Participant Agreement\n\u2022\tResource Entity (RE) Application for Registration\n\u2022\tManaged Capacity Declaration Form\n\u2022\tDesignation of authorized representatives, contacts, User Security Administrator, etc.\nRIOO Resource Data Entry (Substation Data)\nRIOO now contains screens for the IE/RE to enter resource data for the generator and associated substation equipment information needed for ERCOT systems. The content of RIOO\u2019s resource data screens are governed by the Resource Registration Glossary.  RIOO shows the data fields that are required for the selected level of commitment as shown in Figure 11 above.  RIOO allows the following levels of commitment:\n\u2022\tFull Interconnection Study (FIS) \u2013 either Steady State, Short Circuit, or Stability and Dynamic studies separately or any combination\n\u2022\tPlanning Model\n\u2022\tFull Registration\nPrior to Full Registration, ERCOT requests that the RE reach out to ERCOT at least 30 days prior to the deadline for the desired PLD to allow for calls and edits prior to submittal in RIOO-IS for review.  For Full Registration, the desired Production Load Date deadlines can be found in https://www.ercot.com/gridinfo/transmission/opsys-change-schedule. Resource data submitted after 15 days prior to the PLD deadline may not get processed in time to be included in the desired PLD!\nOnce a GIM has reached the PLD, data will move from RIOO-IS to RIOO-RS. From this point forward, the RE shall use RIOO-RS to submit changes to registration data.\nResource data for a Small Generator must use the simplified modeling approach.  This means that the Unit is modeled at the TDSP Station as shown below.\nCurrent DGR Modeling Topology Examples:\nNetwork Modeling Requirements\nThe ERCOT Network Operations Model is defined as: A representation of the ERCOT System providing the complete physical network definition, characteristics, ratings, and operational limits of all elements of the ERCOT Transmission Grid and other information from TSPs, Resource Entities, and QSEs.  ERCOT uses the physical characteristics, ratings, and operational limits provided by TSPs and REs to specify limits within which the ERCOT Transmission Grid will be operated.  The Network Operations Model is the basis for the model used to send accurate Base Points and pricing signals to Market Participants.  During the Modeling phase, data required for dispatching, metering, and communicating with the new or modified Resource will be established and verified.   The model is updated on a scheduled basis as shown in the Network Operations Model Change Schedule in Protocol 3.10.1.  Each BESS or ESR Unit needs to be an equivalent impedance for that Unit.  See here for more information:  https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2022/02/18/Resource_Integration_Working_Group_DGR_Topics_02222022.pptx\nERCOT will work with the IE to establish the all-important Production Load Date (PLD) on which ERCOT\u2019s systems will link together the following key components:\n\u2022\tMetering and Meter Data Acquisition System (MDAS)\n\u2022\tERCOT market settlement information and pricing location\n\u2022\tSupervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Inter-Control Center Communication Protocol (ICCP) communication points\n\u2022\tQSE and Resource Entity relationship and contact information\n\u2022\tThe Network Operations Model of the resource data for the new generator site\nEstablishing these links requires coordination between all involved Market Participants and internal ERCOT departments.  Appendix A of this document also provides a list of forms and links to the ERCOT website where Resource Entities can find the forms and additional information on how to submit modeling data to ERCOT. The PLD for loading the new generator and associated equipment into the Network Operations Model should precede the desired Planned Energization Date of the Point of Interconnection (Checklist Part 1) by at least 15- 30 days.  30 days is typical from PLD to energization.\nThe responsibility for model data submissions is shared between the TSP, QSE and RE. \nTSPs must submit:\n\u2022\tNetwork Operations Model Change Request (NOMCR) for TSP facilities at the Point of Interconnection and any line owned by the TSP to connect the RE site\n\u2022\tOutage requests for equipment being added or removed from the Network Operations Model\n\u2022\tTelemetry points for line flow MW and MVAr of the line connecting the generator station to the TSP POI station.\n\u2022\tTelemetry for KVM and KVT for voltage control \nQSEs must submit:\n\u2022\tICCP communication points for all required telemetry\n\u2022\tOutage requests for all Transmission Facilities/equipment and all generators being added or removed from the Network Operations Model.  \no\tFor a new generation station that has multiple generator owners \u2013 a single QSE (the QSE for the Resource Entity submitting the resource data for the new station) is assigned the responsibility to enter all Transmission Facility outages in the Outage Scheduler regardless of which RE owns the Transmission Facilities at the station or any RE-owned line.  \no\tGenerator outages must be entered by the RE-owner\u2019s QSE.  For Split Generation Resources, the Master QSE must enter the Resource\u2019s outage.\nREs must submit:\t \n\u2022\tModeling data for the new/modified generation including RE-owned and operated Transmission Facilities data through the ERCOT-prescribed process applicable to Resource Entities\n\u2022\tGeneration Node and Meter Mapping package (GENMAP) verification\nThe Generation Node and Meter Mapping (GENMAP) package is compiled by ERCOT and provided to the Resource Entity. The GENMAP package provides documentation on the modeled location of the Resource Node and EPS metering in the Network Operations Model as of the PLD. The Resource Entity will review and provide confirmation to ERCOT that the Generation Node and Meter Mapping is accurate by submitting the Resource Node & EPS Meter Mapping Verification document included in the Generation Node and Meter Mapping package.\nAll resource data submissions and verifications are designed to take effect on the PLD. On this day, with submission of the EPS Cutover form by the TSP, all telemetry and metering with ERCOT will be fully functional and the generator and associated equipment will appear in the ERCOT Network Operations Model. At this point, the generator site is modeled such that it later can be approved for energization, synchronization, and commissioning so that it can proceed to be dispatched, scheduled, and settled in ERCOT market systems.\nERCOT Polled-Settlement Meter and ESI ID Requirements\nERCOT maintains a Meter Data Acquisition System (MDAS) to collect all generation and load data for Settlement purposes as outlined in the Protocols and the Settlement Metering Operating Guide.  MDAS receives its data from ERCOT-Polled Settlement Meters (EPS) which are installed and maintained by TSPs.  Prior to installing EPS meters at generation facilities, TSPs must work with the RE to prepare an EPS Meter Design Proposal with one-line drawings, facility details and contact information.  \nNOTE:  The EPS Meter Design Proposal needs to be submitted by the TSP before the Resource data is submitted by the RE so the meter proposal can be approved before the Resource data submittal deadline shown in protocol 3.10.1(3).  \nTo meet the ERCOT Polled Settlement Meter requirements, TSPs will submit the following to ERCOT:\n\u2022\tMetering Plan\n\u2022\tDesign Proposal with one-lines\n\u2022\tMeter Data Acquisition Form\n\u2022\tMeter Cutover Form\nTSPs may commence installation of the meters as soon as ERCOT approves the design.\nEach service delivery point is assigned an Electronic Service Identifier (ESI ID) by ERCOT for settlement purposes.  Please refer to the ESI ID Service History and Usage Extract User Guide on the ERCOT User Guide webpage for detailed information.\nTelemetry and ICCP Requirements\nERCOT interfaces with each QSE and TSP over a fully redundant, highly available Wide Area Network (WAN).  The WAN is designed for the normal and emergency exchange of Real-Time data and voice communications used for wholesale operations, frequency control, transmission security and emergency operations. \nData exchange between ERCOT, QSEs and TSPs is accomplished by using Inter-control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP) as defined in Chapter 5 of the ICCP Handbook.  The data is used to support functions such as generation control, Current Operating Plans, Outage Scheduling, Dispatch Instructions, posting of information and other applications.  QSEs must work with interconnected TSPs and ERCOT to establish an ICCP points list based on the Resource data and NOMCRs approved for use in the Network Operations Model.\nWind Generation Resources (WGRs) and Photovoltaic Generation Resources (PVGRs) must also provide ICCP points for the site-specific meteorological data required for the Renewable Production Potential forecasts as specified in Protocols 4.2.2 Wind-Powered Generation and & 4.2.3 Photovoltaic Generation Resource Production Potential. \nIn addition to SCED telemetry for the generator(s) and CLR(s), ICCP points for breaker/switch statuses, transformer low and high side kV, line flows MW/MVAr for both ends of the interconnecting line (QSE provides for the RE generation site end of the line and TSP provides for the TSP end of the line), transformer high-side MW/MVAr flows, capacitor/reactor and other reactive device MVAr, load MW/MVAr and generator gross and net MW/MVAr outputs, AVR status and PSS status must be supplied.\nTo assure that the new Resource station and generators will be added to the Network Operations Model on the PLD, the QSE needs to submit the ICCP Point List to ERCOT at least 30 days prior to the PLD. It is expected that the ICCP Points List includes parameters for the new generation and associated equipment, including the interconnecting transmission substation equipment at the Point of Interconnection. \nNOTE:  If insufficient telemetry data is provided during the modeling process, there is a high risk of delay in the energization, synchronization, and commissioning of the new generator.\nAccurate and working telemetry and communication systems from the generation site to the QSE to ERCOT must be tested and proven reliable prior to submittal of the Part 1 checklist for energization and Part 2 checklist for synchronization of all new or modified RE and TSP facilities. \nData Center Loads and/or PUN Loads with IRR Generation\nFor co-located data center loads and/or PUN loads netted with IRR generation, an additional telemetry data point, Gross Real-Time Power Potential (GRPP), will need to be added to reflect the real-time power potential of the IRR. \nSTAGE 3: Energization, Synchronization and Commissioning \nStage 3 involves the following steps:\n\u2022\tFinal Compliance with Operational Standards Review\n\u2022\tNew Generator Commissioning Part 1, 2, and 3 Checklists\n\u2022\tCommissioning Plan Template\n\u2022\tCommissioning Process\n\u2022\tReactive Capability, AVR, PSS and Performance Testing\n\u2022\tResource Status during Testing \nFinal Compliance with Operational Standards \nAs stated in Protocol 16.5 Registration of a Resource Entity, an IE shall not proceed to Initial Synchronization of a generation resource in the event of any of the following conditions:\n\u2022\tERCOT has reasonably determined that the generation resource may violate operational standards established in the Protocols, Planning Guide, Nodal Operating Guides, or Other Binding Documents\n\u2022\tThe Resource Entity has not yet demonstrated to ERCOT\u2019s satisfaction that the generation resource can comply with the Operational Standards.\n\u2022\tThe requirements of Planning Guide 5.3.5, Quarterly Stability Assessment, have not been completed\n\u2022\tAny required sub-synchronous resonance studies have not been completed and approved by ERCOT as specified in the ERCOT Protocols and any required mitigation or monitoring has not been completed.\nBased on ERCOT\u2019s review of the Operational Standards requirements, the RE will be notified by email if the generator to be synchronized has passed or failed to meet the Protocol requirements.    A copy of the compliance report will be available in RIOO-IS.  Initial synchronization will not be allowed until all Operational Standards requirements have been satisfied.\nPlanning Guide Applicability\n\u2022\tNew units that meet PG 5.2.1 and go through the INR process will be required to do Part 1, 2 and 3 checklists \n\u2022\tNew units that do not meet PG 5.2.1, and do not go through the INR process, will be required to submit new resource data and do Part 1, 2 and 3 checklists\n\u2022\tExisting units that meet PG 5.2.1and go through the INR process will be required to do Part 2 and 3 checklists but do not have to do Part 1\n\u2022\tExisting units that do not meet PG 5.2.1- will be required to submit new resource data but will not be required to do Part 1, 2, and 3 checklists\nBackground\nStage 3 is primarily governed by the ERCOT New Generator Commissioning Checklist and the Commissioning Plan Template, which are available on the ERCOT website.  The Generator Commissioning checklist and Commissioning Plan Template process is initiated by the Resource Entity/QSE, and all approvals are made by ERCOT Resource Integration.\nERCOT New Generator Commissioning Checklist\nThe three-part ERCOT New Generator Commissioning Checklist is designed to coordinate the energization, synchronization, and commissioning of a new or modified generator once all qualification measures have been met to the satisfaction of ERCOT.  \nThe three parts of the Generator Commissioning Checklist for interconnection requests representing new generation are:\n\u2022\tPart 1:  Request for Energization of Resource Entity Equipment\n\u2022\tPart 2:  Request for Initial Synchronization \n\u2022\tPart 3:  Request to Commission a Resource\nChecklist Submissions for Existing Generation meeting PG 5.2.1(1)(c)(ii) Seeking to Increase Output:\nFor interconnection requests representing modified Wind Generation Resources meeting PG 5.2.1(1)(c)(ii), Applicability, the Checklist Part 2 above is replaced by the following two Checklist parts, submitted before and after modification:\nPart 2a:  Request for Wind Units meeting PG 5.2.1(1)(c)(ii) Pre-Synchronization [QSE submits checklist to request approval to begin re-power work at the site]\nPart 2b:  Request for Wind Units meeting PG 5.2.1(1)(c)(ii) Initial Synchronization [QSE submits checklist prior to desired Initial Synchronization of first re-powered turbine]\nFor modified Wind Generation Resources meeting PG 5.2.1(1)(c)(ii), Applicability, Checklist Part 1 is not necessary and Checklist Part 3 is unchanged.\nUpon reaching Stage 3 of the interconnection process, these REs and/or QSEs are required to submit the Checklist Part 2 and 3. Checklist Part 1 is not necessary, but the telemetry points listed in Part 1 are still required.   Parts 2 and 3 are necessary to ensure the resource is modeled correctly and able to pass all required testing up to the increased capability. This check also helps ensure that any generation previously exempt from PSS requirements as indicated in Section 2.2.6 of the ERCOT Nodal Operating Guides that have done work on their excitation systems have installed a PSS and are operating with it in service.\nRIOO-IS Commissioning Planned Dates\nIt is very important to update RIOO-IS planned commissioning dates for Energization, Synchronization and Commercial Operation.  RIOO-IS dates are used by ERCOT teams for timing of GTC updates and other key steps during commissioning.  NOTE: If these RIOO-IS planned dates are not kept updated, the project could experience delays in approvals for energization, synchronization, and the commissioning of the generators.\nCommissioning Plan Template\nThe Commissioning Plan Template provides in-depth details on how the facility will be operated during all three stages of the Checklist, including testing of generation and control systems while supporting grid security in accordance with ERCOT Operational Standards.  Within 15 days of receipt, ERCOT shall review the commissioning plan and provide feedback with regards to compliance with operational standards and identify possible operational limitations during the commissioning process. The commissioning plan must include the planned dates for all ERCOT required testing.\nThe 8 sections of the Commissioning Plan Template are:\n\u2022\tSection 1:  General Resource Description\n\u2022\tSection 2:  Resource Controls\n\u2022\tSection 3:  Resource Shut-Down Sequences\n\u2022\tSection 4:  Resource Telemetry Verification\n\u2022\tSection 5:  Resource Commissioning Milestones\n\u2022\tSection 6:  Resource Detailed Commissioning Schedule\n\u2022\tSection 7:  Resource Design Capabilities\n\u2022\tSection 8:  Process Notes and Descriptions\nAll 8 sections of the commissioning plan must be completed before submitting it to ERCOT in RIOO-IS.  \nThe ERCOT New Generator Commissioning Checklist and Commissioning Plan Template verify critical communication points and generation security measures before allowing the Resource Entity to energize the point of interconnection, synchronize generation, and prepare for commissioning of the Resource. \nERCOT 90-day expectation for the Commissioning Process of a Resource\nIf the RE believes that it will take more than 90 days from initial synchronization of the generator to commissioning, the RE needs to provide a statement of the reason for it taking more than 90 days with the Commissioning Plan.  As the Resource commissioning progresses, the RE needs to keep ERCOT advised as to the reasons for any delays that may cause there to be more than 90 days from initial synchronization to Part 3 approval for a generator.\nOutage Scheduler\nThe generator has the responsibility to provide accurate and timely updates to the Outage Scheduler to reflect their expected future equipment unavailability if they are expecting not to be capable of generating at their modeled maximum output level due to equipment derates or generation equipment commissioning progression.  Prior to approval of each stage of commissioning and on an on-going basis, the Outage Scheduler must be updated to accurately reflect the generator\u2019s future derate amount, start time and end time.  Outage submission requirements are outlined in ERCOT Nodal Protocols Section 3.1.  \n[Note: ERCOT\u2019s renewable forecasts make predictions 168 hours (7 days) into the future. Because of this, ERCOT needs accurately updated outage scheduler information 7 days into the future. If the derate has an end-date that is tentative during the commissioning at the site, then the RE/QSE need to review derates daily, to ensure it is accurate for at least 7 days into the future.  Also, be aware that Information regarding planned daily capacity that is provided in the Commissioning Plan is for coordination purposes only during commissioning and is not a substitute for the entries of deratings in the Outage Scheduler].\nCommissioning Process\nAt least 30 days before the RE plans to submit Checklist Part 1, the RE is required to submit a completed Commissioning Plan Template.   \nChecklist submittals and approval:\n\u2022\tSeparate Generator Commissioning Checklists must be submitted for each new generator associated with the same Point of Interconnection. RE/QSE will submit all Checklists to ERCOT using the RIOO-IS application.\n\u2022\tPrior to submitting Part 1 (Energization) of the Checklist, the QSE, Resource Entity, and interconnecting Transmission Service Provider shall ensure that the transmission switchyard facilities have been adequately constructed and modeled in ERCOT\u2019s Network Operations Model and are ready for energization and operation as part of the ERCOT system.\n\u2022\tERCOT recommends that Part 1 of the Checklist be submitted at least 7 Business Days in advance of the planned date of the initial energization of the Point of Interconnection.\n\u2022\tERCOT will provide a response to a submitted Checklist part within 7 Business Days of receipt.\n\u2022\tERCOT recommends that Checklist Part 2 be submitted after approval of Checklist Part 1 by ERCOT and successful energization of the RE site and be at least 7 Business Days from the date ERCOT approves the previous Checklist part.\n\u2022\tChecklist Part 3 can only be submitted after satisfactory completion of required testing and approval by ERCOT.\n\u2022\tAny Checklist Part submitted prior to receiving approval of the previous Checklist Part will be considered as being submitted on the next business day after the approval of the previous Checklist part by ERCOT\nAdditional Details on Commissioning Checklist Submissions\nERCOT reviews and approves Checklist submissions for execution on Business Days only, during the hours of 8 AM to 5 PM Central Prevailing Time (CPT). On Friday\u2019s and the day before ERCOT holidays, Checklists will be either approved before 2 PM CPT or the review will resume on the next Business Day.  Checklist submissions received by ERCOT after 2 PM CPT will be considered as received by ERCOT on the following Business Day. \nERCOT Checklist approval will be communicated by Resource Integration to the IE Contacts listed on RIOO-IS.  RE and QSE contacts will be notified by their ERCOT Account Manager of the checklist approval.  \nUpon receipt of Part 1 of the Checklist, ERCOT shall review it for accuracy and completeness. ERCOT shall then perform a verification of the network model and SCADA telemetry before providing energization approval. Telemetry must be good quality and reasonable for at least 48 hours prior to ERCOT approval.  ERCOT shall provide a response within 7 Business Days of receipt. If any problems are encountered with the network model or SCADA telemetry that cannot be readily resolved, ERCOT shall reject Part 1 of the Checklist, and request the QSE, Resource Entity or Transmission Service Provider, where appropriate, to review and correct any outstanding issues as required, and have the RE resubmit Checklist Part 1.  Part 1 of the Checklist shall not be approved until all identified problems have been resolved to the satisfaction of ERCOT. \nThe above process applies with Checklist Part 2. ERCOT shall review the model and telemetry and will reject Part 2 of the Checklist if any problems are encountered that cannot be readily resolved.  Telemetry must be good quality and reasonable for at least 48 hours prior to ERCOT approval.  \nERCOT\u2019s approval of Part 1 and Part 2 checklists, energization of the generator\u2019s Point of Interconnection and synchronization of the generator to the grid, is given for a specific target day requested by the Resource Entity (Part 1) or QSE (Part 2) and is subject to real-time grid operating conditions. Accordingly, the Resource Entity\u2019s QSE must contact the ERCOT control room on the day of energization as per ERCOT\u2019s Operating Procedures and receive permission to proceed prior to station energization or synchronization of the generation. \nIf system conditions are such that energizing the generator station facilities or allowing the generation to synchronize to the grid will place unnecessary risk to the ERCOT Transmission Grid, ERCOT System Operators have the authority to cancel or otherwise prohibit these actions. \nChecklist Part 3 approval requires verification of several generator capabilities such as reactive capability, primary frequency response, base point compliance during curtailment and voltage control. Obtaining approval of Checklist Part 3 is dependent on the time necessary for the RE and QSE to commission the equipment and conduct all required performance testing. Once all testing has been performed, ERCOT shall review all test results within 30 days of test submittal and approve Checklist Part 3 within 7 business days of submittal as appropriate.  The reactive test and AVR test need to both be submitted before review will begin.  The review will then have 30 days after the submittal of the latest of the two tests. It\u2019s best to submit all testing to ERCOT as soon as possible to allow sufficient time to review.  If any issues are identified with regards to performance testing that cannot be readily resolved, ERCOT shall reject the Part 3 submittal, and request the QSE, Resource Entity or Transmission Service Provider, where appropriate, review and correct any outstanding issues as required, and then resubmit Checklist Part 3. Part 3 of the Checklist shall not be approved until all identified problems have been resolved to the satisfaction of ERCOT.\nChecklist Part 3 requires submittal of 5 minutes of sample PMU data during a period that the generators are on-line with outputs greater than zero.  The PMU data needs to comply with Operating Guide Section 6.1.3 Phasor Measurement Recording Equipment Including Dynamic Disturbance Recording Equipment.  The PMU sample data file is in the form of worksheet or comma separated data file.  Column A is the Date/Timestamp followed by columns for voltage phasor magnitude and angle for each phase, current phasor magnitude and angle for each phase, frequency and df/dt.  There should be at least 30 data rows per second.  Sample PMU data files need to be uploaded to RIOO-IS for each generator or if PMU data for IRRs is collected on the high side of the MPT, then at least one file for each MPT.  File name needs to identify the INR#, project name, station code and generator or MPT codes.  File names can only include alpha-numeric characters, underscores, and dashes.  It is suggested that the sample PMU files be provided during Part 3 testing.\nChecklist Part 3 for Generation Resources and Energy Storage Resources requesting to commission a Resource during the winter months (December through February), the Declaration of Preparedness \u2013 Generation Entity Winter Weatherization required by Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) Substantive Rule 25.55(c)(3)(A), require statement of the date that it was submitted.  Likewise for summer months (June through September), the Declaration of Preparedness \u2013 Generation Entity Summer Weatherization required by PUCT Substantive Rule 25.55(c)(3)(B) and Attachment K: Declaration of Natural Gas Pipeline Coordination was submitted require a statement of the date that it was submitted.   \nChecklist Part 3 requires acknowledgement that a Plant Verification Report is required to be submitted to ERCOT within 30 days following Part 3 approval in accordance with PG 5.5.\nThe Checklist Part 3 approval by ERCOT represents the Resource Commissioning Date and approval for participation in ERCOT market operations. This represents that final review by ERCOT and initial qualification testing by the RE has been completed and the generator has progressed out of the interconnection process.  [Note:  Ancillary Service testing and qualifications are separate from Part 3 testing.]\nBase Point, Reactive Power Capability, VSS, AVR, PFR and PSS Testing\nFor the generator to be commissioned and approved for participation in ERCOT market operations, it must demonstrate that it can satisfy ERCOT\u2019s requirements for following its base points (during curtailments for IRRs and IRR Groups), Reactive Power (both leading and lagging), Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR), Primary Frequency Response (PFR), and Power System Stabilizer (PSS), as applicable to the generation type. \nThese performance tests are some of the final steps before the commissioning of a generator. ERCOT may direct the generator to isolate from the grid until the required testing has been completed or mitigation plans have been established to address operational risks until the testing can be completed.\nBase Point following during Curtailment \u2013 IRRs and IRR Groups\nDue to increased numbers of Generic Transmission Constraints and IROLs, ERCOT is requiring IRRs and IRR Groups to perform Curtailment testing before allowing IRRs and IRR Groups to connect more than 20 MVA of generation capacity to the Point of Interconnection during commissioning. Per protocol requirement 6.5.7.4 and 6.6.5.4, IRR units should follow SCED Base Points when curtailed.  A curtailed IRR that is not in an IRR Group will receive telemetered SBBH (SCED Base Point Below HDL) telemetry flag that is set to \u201cON\u201d and should follow it\u2019s telemetered Base Point.  IRR Groups are curtailed if any IRR in the IRR Group receives a telemetered SBBH flag of \u201cON\u201d and the IRR Group total output should be curtailed to the sum of the Base Points for the IRRs in the IRR Group.\nThere are two forms of curtailment test depending on if the IRR under test a single unit or part of an IRR Group is (which is comprised of multiple IRR units). Below is an example of the Curtailment test procedure for a single IRR and the expected response from the unit followed by an example of Curtailment of an IRR Group.\nIRR Unit Curtailment Testing (Note:  Use the following process for an individual IRR that is not in an IRR Group)\nStep #0: Following approval to conduct the Curtailment Self-Test, set RST to \u201cONTEST\u201d (RST=8) for the unit.\nStep #1: Set Curtailment Flag to True (SBBH=True) and BP = 0 MW for the unit \n\u2022\tThis sends a curtailment to 0 MW to the unit\n\u2022\tThe unit should respond to the curtailment and the output is expected to be equal to zero MW.\n\u2022\tMaintain the curtailment for 15 minutes \n\u2022\tNote that ERCOT will evaluate how the unit\u2019s output (MW), HSL, ramping rate and turbines/inverters availability are telemetered during a 15-minute observation period.\nStep #2: Following the completion of the above 15 minutes, set Curtailment Flag to False (SBBH=False) for the unit. \n\u2022\tThis releases the unit from curtailment. \n\u2022\tThe unit should ramp up its power output until the unit\u2019s output (MW) matches its HSL.\nStep #3: Following the completion of the above test, set RST to \u201cON\u201d (RST=3) for the unit so it can follow SCED curtailment instructions.\n\u2022\tNote that ERCOT will observe the 10 minutes period after the completion of the test to analyze how the unit\u2019s output (MW), HSL, ramping rate and turbines/inverters availability are telemetered.\n Step#4: Provide ERCOT with the date and beginning/ending times of the Curtailment Self-Test.\nIRR Group Curtailment Testing (Note: The IRR Group is being curtailed at each step below; these are not individual unit curtailments)\nStep #0: Following approval to conduct the IRR Group Curtailment Self-Test, to begin the test, set RST telemetered to ERCOT to \u201cONTEST\u201d (RST=8) for all the units in the IRR Group.\nStep #1:  QSE sends telemetry to Resources setting Curtailment Flag to True (SBBH=True) and BP = 0 MW for the first unit of the IRR Group.  This should be recognized as an IRR Group curtailment.  If any unit in the IRR Group receives a SBBH = True, then the IRR Group is being curtailed.  During IRR Group curtailment, the HSL for all units in the IRR Group should be telemetered to ERCOT as the unit\u2019s output capability considering wind-speed/irradiance and the number of turbines/inverters available to generate.\n\u2022\tThe IRR Group should respond to the curtailment and the group\u2019s output is expected to be equal to group\u2019s output prior to Step #1 minus the first unit\u2019s output prior to Step #1 (\u201cX1\u201d MW).  In this step the IRR Group is curtailed by a total of X1 MW.\n\u2022\tMaintain the IRR Group curtailment for 15 minutes \n\u2022\tNote that ERCOT will observe the 15 minutes period to analyze how the IRR Group output (sum of the group\u2019s unit MW output), IRR Group unit\u2019s HSL, ramping rate and turbines/inverters availability are telemetered.\n\u2022\tRepeat Step #1 for the remaining units within IRR Group.  Each time, curtailment test increases the IRR Group curtailment amount by the pre-curtailment output of the next unit within the same IRR Group in successive steps.  Following the initial curtailment, the IRR Group is then curtailed by the second unit\u2019s pre-curtailment MW output (\u201cX2\u201d MW), and then in the next step by the third unit\u2019s pre-curtailment output (\u201cX3\u201d MW), and so on.\n\u2022\tWhen the IRR group is curtailed by the pre-curtailment output of the last unit in the IRR Group, the group output is expected to be equal to zero MW.\nStep #2: Following the completion of the above IRR Group curtailment periods, set Curtailment Flag to False (SBBH=False) for all the IRR Group units. \n\u2022\tThis releases the IRR Group from curtailment. \n\u2022\tThe IRR Group should ramp up output until the IRR Group output (sum of its units\u2019 MW outputs) matches the sum of the IRR Group units\u2019 HSL.\nStep #3: Following the completion of the above test, set RST telemetered to ERCOT to \u201cON\u201d (RST=3) for the IRR Group units so it the IRR Group can follow SCED curtailment instructions.\n\u2022\tNote that ERCOT will observe the 10 minutes period after the completion of the test to analyze how the IRR Group unit\u2019s output (MW), HSL, ramping rate and turbines/inverters availability are telemetered."

    "text": "Step#4: Provide ERCOT with the date and beginning/ending times of the IRR Group Curtailment Self-Test.\nThe curtailment test will confirm the ability of a single IRR unit or an IRR Group to follow the SCED Base Point and to respond in a proper way when released from curtailment as well as the accuracy of the telemetry. When an IRR unit is not curtailed, HSL is expected to be equal to unit\u2019s output. However, when the IRR unit is curtailed, its HSL should reflect the available capacity in power production which is a function of the available turbine/inverters and meteorological conditions (wind speed and solar irradiance). In other words, HSL should correlate with the wind speed/ solar irradiance if the number of turbine/inverters is not changed when curtailed. When an IRR unit is curtailed, the wind turbine/ inverters in operations should be telemetered as NTON (available). The HSL should have a smooth transition prior and post curtailment, and HSL is not expected to drop to the unit\u2019s output when the curtailment is lifted. In addition, the units up/down ramp rate telemetry should be accurate, and the units must follow this ramp rate when being curtailed to ensure the reliability of ERCOT\u2019s grid.\nReactive Power Capability\nTypically, coordinated Reactive Power Capability tests are performed in coordination with ERCOT and the TSP as described in Operating Guide section 3.3.2.2 Reactive Testing Requirements.  Although the ERCOT Operating Guides recommend maximum leading reactive tests be performed in low load months, and maximum lagging reactive tests be performed in high load months, this is often not possible for initial operation. Coordinated Reactive testing is generally required for Part 3 approval. \nIf issues arise in completing a non\u2010coordinated reactive test, then a coordinated reactive test will be required. No extensions to complete reactive testing for Part 3 approval are provided. If either leading or lagging reactive test cannot be completed due to RE plant limitations, the issues must be resolved, and a new reactive test conducted. \nAll Resources need to submit a Reactive Test through NDCRC.  DGRs or DESRs that are in a fixed power factor (unity power factor) control mode need to submit a reactive test with 0\u2019s or 0.1 for all MVAr values.\nVoltage Support Service (VSS) \nAll Generation Resources connecting over 20 MVA of gross capacity or those units connected at the same Point of Interconnection aggregating to greater than 20 MVA of gross capacity shall provide VSS according to Protocol Section 3.15 (2) Voltage Support. This means that Generation Resources, such as wind or solar plants that plan on energizing their facility as new equipment is installed, shall meet the requirement to provide VSS as required in the Protocols once the gross connected capacity of the generation resource exceeds 20 MVA. \nIf unable to provide VSS until the generation resource is fully constructed, the Resource Entity may continue commissioning the new equipment so long as the Resource Entity has only 20 MVA of equipment energized at a time. \nFor IRRs, once a generation unit has enough generation capacity available for AVR, PFR and VSS control and has passed a curtailment self-test and has submitted an email attestation to ERCOT Resource Integration of being able to provide this control, the Resource Entity can request approval from ERCOT to connect more than 20 MVA and up to the capability at which the generation unit(s) can provide VSS and voltage control. \nThe way a generation resource can operate above 20 MVA shall be documented in the Commissioning Plan.  For Intermittent Renewable Resources planning on providing VSS in part using capacitor and reactive banks, it is encouraged that those reactive devices be installed by the beginning of Stage 3 (prior to Checklist Part 1 approval) to maximize output from the generator during the Commissioning process.  Note that capacitor and reactor banks can only be used to make up for losses from the generator terminal to the POIB.\nAutomatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) \nOperating Guide Section 2 governs AVR tests and testing.  All generators are required to have an AVR and have it on-line when generating.  AVR testing is done in accordance Operating Guide section 2.2.5, Automatic Voltage Regulators and varies slightly by technology type.  A Resource Entity required to provide VSS shall maintain the generator voltage or Reactive Power schedule to maintain voltage at the POIB to be within a tolerance band of the Voltage Set Point while operating at less than or equal to the maximum reactive capability of the Generation Resource.  A Generation Resource\u2019s POIB voltage may be out of the tolerance band ONLY if it has exhausted all of its reactive capability.  The tolerance bands are as follows:\nVoltage tolerance band in Op Guide 2.7.3.5(4):\nNominal Voltage\tTolerance\nBand KV\n345\t+/- 4kV\n230\t+/- 3kV\n138\t+/- 2kV\n115\t+/- 2kV\n69\t+/- 1kV\nThe required VSS response times for Generation Resources when voltage measurements at the POIB are outside of the Voltage Set Point tolerance band identified in paragraph (4) of Section 2.7.3.5, Resource Entity Responsibilities and Generation Resource Requirements, then the unit mvar capability and all switchable shunts (If applicable) must be fully deployed in no more than five minutes.  The following document are posted at https://www.ercot.com/services/rq/integration:\n\u2022\tCombined AVR Template  is used to complete the AVR test for IRRs, ESRs and conventional generators.  \n\u2022\tAVR Testing Expectations for IRR explains what is expected for the IRR AVR test.\n\u2022\tAVR and PSS Test Guidelines for Conventional Generation explains what is expected for the conventional generation AVR test.\n\u2022\tAVR Test Guidelines for DESRs (DGRs) explains what is expected for distribution connected Resources (DGRs, DESRs).\nHere is how the AVR test should work:\nPrimary Frequency Response (PFR)\nPFR testing is performed in accordance with Nodal Operating Guide Section 8, Attachment C. Test data is submitted to ERCOT via NDCRC.\nPower System Stabilizer (PSS)\nSynchronous generators must have a PSS installed per Nodal Operating Guide Section 2.2.6. PSS testing requirements are included in Nodal Operating Guide Section 2.2.6(7).\nGenerator Status during the Commissioning Process - ONTEST, ON and OUT Status \nDuring the commissioning process for new unit(s), the QSE will submit a generator status in the COP and telemetry in accordance with Protocol section 3.9.1 Current Operating Plan (COP) Criteria. \n\u2022\tBefore approval of Part 2 up to 20 MVA, the Resource status of \u201cOUT\u201d is expected with associated Outage Scheduler entry with HSL = 0.\n\u2022\tAfter approval of Part 2 up to 20 MVA of connected capacity (IRRs and BESS) when the unit is on-line:\no\tResource status of \u201cONTEST\u201d is expected if the AVR, PFR, VSS and curtailment controls are not yet functioning \u2013 this indicates to SCED that the unit(s) can\u2019t curtail output under full automatic control.\no\tOutage Scheduler entry for HSL is entered based on connected capacity and operating conditions\no\tBattery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) units need to demonstrate the correct telemetry for both charging load and discharging generation as a portion of the telemetry check-out before approval to lift the 20 MVA limit.\n\u2022\tAfter approval of Part 2 over 20 MVA connected capacity - \no\tIRRs having their control system in automatic control mode and having passed the Curtailment Test), when the unit(s) are on-line, it is expected that the generator status will be \u201cON\u201d except during PFR, AVR and Leading and Lagging Reactive testing and  for a limited number of hours for specific tests that would require a certain level of MW output in order to tune controls for Part 3 testing or other specific exceptional cases.  Requests for unit testing are submitted by the QSE to ERCOT Operations.\no\tWhen the unit(s) are unavailable a generator Status is expected to be \u201cOUT\u201d.  When a unit is sending real-time telemetry status of \u201cOUT\u201d, it also should reflect this in its COP to let ERCOT know how long it will be unavailable.  In this sense, COP status and real-time Resource status (RST) should match if the status is \u201cOUT\u201d.\no\tThe use of \u201cOFF\u201d status is not expected during the commissioning process because it would indicate that the unit(s) are \u201coff-line but available\u201d for RUC and DAM dispatch which would not be the typical case.\no\tSolar units - at night, would not use \u201cOUT\u201d status unless the unit is on outage or the breaker is open.  As long as the unit is on-line at night but not injecting power, it should continue to send \u201cONTEST\u201d before Part 2 over 20 MVA approval. Following Part 2 over 20 MVA approval it should send the \u201cON\u201d status.  A telemetered AVR status of \u201cON\u201d indicates the unit\u2019s AVR system\u2019s ability to change unit MVAr output within the registered reactive capabilities at the current unit MW output level to control voltage.\no\tNon-IRR units can request unit testing and if approved can use the \u201cONTEST\u201d status during commissioning.  Use of the \u201cON\u201d status requires following of SCED Base Points.  Requests for unit testing are submitted by the QSE to ERCOT Operations.\nNote: Generators using an \u201cON\u201d status are subject to Base Point Deviation charges and GREDP monitoring.\nOperation Requirement of Data Center Loads and/or PUN loads with IRR Generation\n\u2022\tQSEs need to estimate load consumption for PUN load or Data Center load for the next 168 hours\n\u2022\tQSEs will deduct the estimated load consumption from the vendor-provided IRR forecast to update the COP HSL, which would need to be reduced further if there is any equipment outage or derate that is not reported in the Outage Scheduler. \nForecasting vendors will produce the forecast for the gross capability for the next 168 hours to estimate the power potential for the IRR\u2003\nAPPENDIX A: Helpful Resources and Links \nPublic Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) Substantive Rules 25.198 governs the initiation of transmission service in Texas, and Substantive Rule \u00a725.109 outlines the certification, licensing, and registration of generators.

This information will help your manufacturer provide functional models.\n1.\tIntroduction\nTo adequately simulate dynamic and transient events in the ERCOT System, it is necessary to establish and maintain dynamics data and simulation-ready study cases representing the dynamic capability and frequency characteristics of machines and equipment connected to the ERCOT System.  ERCOT Dynamics Working Group (DWG) uses the PSS/E and TSAT software programs.  Standard library models, including the so called \u201cWECC Generic Models\u201d are preferred provided the model accuracy is good, as these models are simpler to use and maintain.  Often, however, generators especially IRRs and batteries will require use of User-Defined Models (UDM).  UDM models utilize compiled model code provided by the manufacturer (.dll file) to expand the capability of the simulation program.  To improve compatibility, ERCOT requests that all UDM models adhere to these guidelines.\n2.\tUDM Guidance\nSome UDMs lack features or have certain limitations that have been observed to create challenges in preparing DWG simulation-ready study cases and are often difficult or impossible to use in large scale grid studies.  The following list of items provides discussion and recommendations regarding UDM characteristics based on user experience.\n\u2022\tDetailed Model Manual shall be provided:\nThe model manual should contain all the information needed to set up the dynamic model and understand its overall behavior.  In particular,\no\tManual should describe how the poweflow generator model should be set up, including values for Rsource, Xsource, MBase, Qmin, Qmax, and whether the model is considered a \u201cWind Machine\u201d in PSSE.\no\tManual should list and describe the major tunable control parameters.\no\tManual should provide a high level control block diagram illustrating major control functions and how the tunable control parameters are utilized.\n\u2022\tInter-Model Communication:\no\tDocumentation should be included on how the model exchanges data (e.g., real and reactive power setpoint or other data exchange) with other downstream or upstream models. \no\tIf submitting a site-specific model, this interfacing between specific upstream/downstream models should be verified, e.g., data exchange between power plant controller (PPC), wind turbine generator (WTG) and STATCOM user-defined models.\n\u2022\tParameter Error Checking: \no\tError and warning messages should be provided to users as appropriate.\no\tThe model should be setup with correct parameter conditions such as min/max values if applicable to allow the software tool to catch and report on issues when running simulation.\n\u2022\tMultiple Module Dependencies:\nWhen multiple modular user-defined models are used to represent a plant, there is a possibility that the end user may exclude required modules (intentionally or unintentionally). Module dependencies should be verified when a UDM is developed, and an error thrown when dependencies are not present. Failure to perform this dependency/error handling has the potential to cause the simulation software to crash.\n\u2022\tMultiple Instances:\nIn one ERCOT case, a given user defined model file (.dll or .tudm) may be used at different sites. The UDM should be verified to operate properly in this situation.\n\u2022\tAccess of External Files:\no\tWith default parameters, the UDM code should not write to files.\no\tError messages should be sent using the appropriate APIs. Diagnostic messages should also be suppressed with default model parameters. \no\tAccessing/reading from a file is OK, but note that other instances of model may be accessing at the same time.\n\u2022\tOperating Points:\no\tModel should be simulated, and behavior validated at a variety of operating points that are expected to be encountered in a powerflow. At minimum, all MQT tests should be performed at 100% dispatch and additional LVRT test should be performed at 50% and 10% dispatches.\n\u2022\tCompatible TSAT model shall be provided:\no\tThe same UDM shall be supplied for TSAT software. Typically, this requires submitting compatible .dll and .tudm (template UDM) files.  \no\tIn addition to ERCOT\u2019s general guideline for UDMs (applicable to both TSAT and PSS/E models), there are some guidelines specific to TSAT:\n\uf0a7\tInstantiation Compatibility: \nThe UDM model for TSAT should be compatible with the PSS/E dyr file format, thus one should be able to use the same site-specific parameter list in both software platforms.\n\uf0a7\tEquipment Name Support and Validation:\nThe model should operate with dynamic data files in \u201cbus number\u201d format (similar to PSS/E) and in \u201cequipment name\u201d format. \nEquipment name format is specific to TSAT and allows a unique 32-character identified to be used for mapping dynamic (or other auxiliary data). \nUDM authors should also verify that model works with equipment names that include space characters. \nIt should also be verified that the TSAT case operates equivalently in both bus-number and equipment name format by running equivalent test scenarios.\n\uf0a7\tTransfer Analysis: \nThe model should be verified to operate as expected in a \u201ctransfer\u201d scenario, that is, utilizing TSAT\u2019s transfer analysis feature to automatically re-dispatch the unit other test (or other units in the system). Here, testing of all model functionality should be performed at multiple transfer \u201cpoints\u201d. \nAny model features which are intended to interact directly with TSAT generator (re)dispatch should be verified.\n\uf0a7\tNumerical Integration Methods:\nModel should operate consistently when using different numerical integration methods, e.g., Modified Euler (ME), RK2, RK3, or RK4.\n\uf0a7\tCompatibility with Distributed Computation:\nModel should be tested for compatibility with TSAT\u2019s distributed computation feature, where multiple TSAT server instances are processing multiple scenarios which all utilize the UDM.\nModel instructions should include details of which supporting files are required to be accessible by TSAT server instances, i.e., in addition to the DLL/TUDM.\n\uf0a7\tModel Quality Testing:\nAll ERCOT model-quality testing guidelines should be followed, testing the TSAT site-specific model in both equipment name and bus-number format. \n\uf0a7\tCritical Clearing Time (CCT) \u2013 TSAT has a special mode of operation which allows for determination of the critical clearing time for a given contingency list.  As the execution sequence for CCT mode differs from basecase or transfer analysis, it is recommended that model authors ensure that this mode of operation does not cause issues with the developed user defined model by including a CCT scan as part of testing.\n\uf0a7\tMulti-Threaded capability \u2013 As of V23.0.0, TSAT has the capability to perform simulations using a multi-threaded process which can speed up simulation run-time considerably. At present, user-defined DLLs (DLBs) are restricted to a single thread so there are no additional considerations for DLB authors, however it is suggested that the model be tested with TSAT operating in both single- and multi-threaded mode to ensure compatibility with this feature.  In future, if support is expanded to allow vendor DLBs to operate across multiple threads, additional testing may be necessary.\n\uf0a7\tSmall Signal Stability Analysis (SSAT) \u2013 The DSATools SSAT module makes use of linearized eigenvalue analysis to study power system oscillatory behavior. In order for a dynamic model to be incorporated in that analysis, a Jacobian matrix for that device must be defined. This can either be defined explicitly in a DLL (DLB), accounting for initial conditions and all modes of operation. As an alternative, a simplified variant of the model may be prepared in the DSATools UDM standard format, model benchmarked against non-linear time-domain model.\n\uf0a7\tTrapezoidal Integration \u2013 In order for trapezoidal integration to be used in a TSAT simulation, the Jacobian matrix (as noted with SSAT above) as well as dynamic step size support must be verified in the model (see above regarding variable time steps).\n\uf0a7\tPerformance Impact Testing \u2013 TSAT is commonly used in operation applications (control center environments) where simulation performance is critical. In addition, TSAT-RTDS co-simulation and PMU data streaming (ePMU module) require simulations to run in real-time, and the ability to do so may be impacted by execution of user-defined models. Model developers are therefore recommended to verify and report any significant impact their model may have on simulation performance (and, if applicable, other factors which may impact ability to simulate in real-time), especially when a model may be instantiated many times in a given simulation (i.e., used across multiple plants).\n\n\u2022\tBlack-box model with limited control and model information:\nMost UDM user manuals focus on how to incorporate model properly in the simulation tool.  Many features are described very briefly without detailed control block diagrams and design logic included in the document.  This basic information may allow a user to include the model in the study tool but is not sufficient to fully understand the response and perform further investigation for observed responses. \n\u2022\tAvoid Multiple library files and specific set up:\nUDMs generally should avoid utilizing multiple linked library files or parameter files or a specific folder structure unless this method provides a clear benefit, such as providing greater fidelity in model response.\n\u2022\t.DLL Files only:\nFor PSSE software, ERCOT no longer accepts models that require linking and/or compiling.  Thus ERCOT no longer accepts .OBJ and .LIB model files in PSSE.\n\u2022\tTime Step Flexibility:\nModels should be capable of running at a range of time steps commonly used in dynamic simulation (e.g. half cycle or lower).\n\u2022\tLimited Number of Key Parameters and Settings:\nManufacturers should strive to limit the number of parameters to those that are typically tuned or adjusted.\n\u2022\tDiagnostic Messaging:\nThe best UDMs provide informative messages during initialization to help debug issues.\n\u2022\tImmune to numerical noise / transients:\nDuring/after faults, bus frequency, which is a calculated value in PSSE, may be subject to numerical deviations.  Protection models should avoid using instantaneous protection (zero pickup time) and consider whether additional filtering and associated time delay is necessary.\n\u2022\tGracefully Handle Islanding:\nModels should not crash when islanded but instead should trip.\n\u2022\tGracefully Handle GNETing or out-of-service:\nThe GNET function in PSSE is a useful debugging tool to discount certain plant dynamics.  Some UDMs also require removal of the dynamic model itself in order to GNET properly, which makes the debugging process cumbersome.\n\u2022\tGood Memory Management:\nUDMs require designated memory location to write the response.  Poor memory management can write to the memory address that is out of the bound of the allocated space by PSS/E and affect other models in the system.  \n\u2022\tProtocol-Required Capability:\nExcept where otherwise allowed, all generating plants must have dynamic reactive power and automatic voltage regulation capability (NP 3.15 and NOG 2.2.5), Voltage Ride Through capability (NOG 2.9), and Frequency Response (NOG 2.2.7), among others.  This required capability should be reflected in provided models.\no\tIn addition, control strategies should consider the need to provide system support while coordinating with nearby resources.  Voltage regulation with droop capability and dynamic reactive capability during voltage ride through are examples of such response.\n\u2022\tFully Support PSS/E UDM Implementation:\nModels should avoid requiring a specific unit ID to be utilized such as \u201c1\u201d or \u201cW\u201d or \u201cG1\u201d.  Models should avoid requiring Qmin and Qmax limits to be set artificially in power flow, such as Qmin=Qmax or Qmin=Qmax=0.\n\nERCOT PSCAD Model Submittal Guidelines\n\nERCOT requests you submit this completed checklist along with your PSCAD model.  Please include this completed sheet in the same zip file when submitting your PSCAD model to your RARF form or RIOO system.\n1.\tIntroduction\nPSCAD models are a specialized type of model used in Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) studies.  These models are more detailed than standard dynamic stability models (e.g. PSS/E models) and are necessary for modeling generators in weak grid studies and subsynchronous resonance studies, among others.\nNot all PSCAD models are created equal.  Some are unreasonably difficult to use and some contain certain modeling approximations.  In order to provide better quality control, ERCOT with the help of the Dynamic Model Task Force created this check-sheet.  When submitting a PSCAD model to ERCOT, please fill out this check sheet and attach it along with your model (zip the files together).  This will facilitate ERCOT providing feedback, and ultimately reduce issues that may occur down the road.\nIt is expected that all PSCAD models adhere to these guidelines.  Any deviations should be documented and explained and will be subject to review.  This form should only be completed by an SME knowledgeable with the inner-workings of the PSCAD black-box model, usually this implies OEM staff\n  PSCAD submission checklist:\n\n\uf0fc\tInclude a Model Quality Test (MQT) report overlaying the PSCAD and PSS/E model response.  If utilizing a user-defined-model in PSS/E, then also include the TSAT model response in the overlay.\n\uf0fc\tPSCAD model inserted into the ERCOT PSCAD Template, available in the \u201cDynamic Model Templates\u201d package posted at:  https://www.ercot.com/services/rq/re\n\uf0fc\tInclude this completed checksheet (check off the items in the below tables).\n\uf0fc\tInclude the PSCAD model manual.\n\uf0fc\tInclude PSCAD files and libraries compiled for both 32-bit and 64-bit Fortran compilers if possible.\n\n\n\n\nThe checklist below is applicable for models associated with the following facility (indicate project name and/or GINR# and/or ERCOT Site Code):\n\n\n\n\nContact for person completing this form:\n\n\n\n2.\tPSCAD Model Requirement\nModel Accuracy Features\nIn order to be sufficiently accurate, the model provided for each facility shall:\nItem\tDescription\tCheck\n1\tRepresent the full detailed inner control loop of the power electronics. The model cannot use the same approximations classically used in transient stability modeling and should fully represent all fast inner controls, as implemented in the real equipment. \t\n2\t Utilize actual hardware code in creating the PSCAD model *OR* validate the model by comparing the model to measured device response.  Validation should be performed for a standard set of disturbances AND include a small signal frequency sweep to confirm the subsynchronous behavior over 5 to 55 Hz.  (Beware that models assembled using standard blocks available in the PSCAD master library introduce unacceptable approximations).\t\n3\tIncorporate a full IGBT representation (preferred) or use a voltage source interface that mimics IGBT switching.  Average source voltage-like models are acceptable if considered accurate for grid stability studies.  Average source models should contain directly connected back-diodes for numerical stability. \t\n4\tRepresent plant level controllers as they are implemented in the real controls, such as automatic voltage regulation.  Model communication and other delays.\t\n5\tParameters requiring site-specific adjustment should be made user-accessible. For example, the plant level controller should provide access to regulation gains and droop settings.\t\n6\tRepresent all pertinent control features as they are implemented in the real controls (e.g. customized PLLs, ride-through controllers, etc.).  Incorporate expected site-specific adjustments and settings.\t\n7\tRepresent Subsynchronous Oscillation (SSO) mitigation and/or protection including the ability to enable and disable SSO mitigation/protection, if applicable.\t\n8\tRepresent shunt capacitor and reactor banks and any dynamic reactive devices.  The controls should be modeled if the equipment dynamically responds to a disturbance within 10 seconds.  It is recommended to include an initialization routine, even if the controls are not explicitly modeled, so that the capacitor and reactor banks will be at the correct initial operating position at the start of the simulation.  For example, if the plant controller would normally place all shunt capacitors in service for 100% dispatch in real power and no shunt capacitors in service for 50% dispatch in real power, then it is recommended that an initialization routine would include this same logic.\t\n9\tRepresent all pertinent electrical and mechanical configurations, such as filters and specialized transformers.  Mechanical features (such as gearboxes, pitch controllers, etc.) should be included in the model if they impact electrical performance.\t\n10\tHave all pertinent protections modeled in detail. This includes various over-voltage and under-voltage protections (individual phase and RMS), frequency protections, DC bus voltage protections, overcurrent protection, and any other protection which can influence ride-through behavior.  Actual code is recommended to model these protection features.  Mechanical protections, such as thermal, should be modeled to extent may limit ride through capability.\t\n11\tAccurately reflect behavior throughout the valid (MW and MVAr) output range from minimum power through maximum power.  Represent machine slip of Type III (DFIG) wind generation as appropriate for the power dispatch.  This value should be calculated and not require manual entry.\t\n12\tModel main power transformer saturation based upon transformer test reports.  Model main power transformer protection system.  This feature is not required but recommended to help diagnose ferroresonance for resources locating close to series capacitors.\t\n13\tIf PLL loss of synchronism protection, phase angle jump protection, or anti-islanding protection is installed, confirm with the OEM that it is necessary protection and it is correctly modeled in PSCAD.  If not needed, ERCOT requests that these protections be disabled as they have been linked to ride through failures .  If needed, please describe why.\t(Not installed / modeled & needed because...)\n14\tFor Type 3 Wind Turbines, include a note, label, flag, or switch in the model indicating clearly whether subsynchronous damping controls are active.\t\n15\tModel dynamics of the DC bus in the inverter/converter, including capacitor discharging and protection.\t\n\nModel Usability Features\nIn order to allow study engineers to perform system studies and analyze simulation results, the model provided for each facility shall:\n15\tHave pertinent control or hardware options accessible to the user (e.g. adjustable protection thresholds or real power recovery ramp rates).  Diagnostic flags (e.g. flags to show control mode changes or which protection has been activated) should be accessible to facilitate analysis and should clearly identify why a model trips during simulations.\t\n16\tAccurately simulates for a timestep between 10 \u03bcs and 20 \u03bcs.  Requiring a smaller time step may mean that the control implementation has not used the interpolation features of PSCAD or has used inappropriate interfacing between the model and the larger network.  It is preferable if the model can operate accurately for any arbitrary timestep between 10 \u03bcs and 20 \u03bcs, however ERCOT may accept plant models that require a different time-step if the model simulates reasonably fast per ERCOT\u2019s sole discretion.\t\n16.1\tCompletes a 10-second simulation in PSCAD in under approximately 300 seconds using a typical computer set up (under 180 seconds ideal). If taking more than 300 seconds, subject to further discussion.\t\n17\tInclude documentation and a sample implementation test case.  Access to technical support engineers is desirable.\t\n18\tBe capable of initializing itself.  Models shall initialize and ramp to full output within without external input from simulation engineers.\t\n19\tAccept external reference values.  This includes real and reactive power reference values (for Q control modes), or voltage reference values (for V control modes) and utilize a single parameter for adjusting real power, and separately, a single parameter for adjusting voltage setpoints.  Adjustments should be easy to identify, such as using memo markers or a slider control (preferred).\t\n20\tAllow protection models to be disabled.  Many studies result in inadvertent tripping of converter equipment, and the ability to disable protection functions temporarily provides study engineers with valuable system diagnostic information.\t\n21\tProvide a switch to disable saturation on the main power transformer and the inverter or turbine local transformers for investigation of ferroresonance.\t\n22\tAllow the active power capacity of the model to be scaled.  This is distinct from a dispatchable power order and is used for modeling different plant capacities (e.g. if a portion of the plant is offline).\t\n23\tHave a simple means to represent curtailed operation for a power response to a frequency dip versus uncurtailed operation for no response to a frequency dip.\t\n24\tAvoid using PSCAD simulation sets, as these are difficult to incorporate into much larger cases.  Use of ETRAN+ is okay.  (ETRAN+ version 5 recommended.)\t\n25\tProject PSCAD model should accept real power dispatch and voltage reference commands as a variable (not a Fortran constant) for external dispatch initialization.\t\n26\tProject PSCAD model should accept reactive power initialization to seed the initial Power Plant Controller reactive state variable at the start of the simulation, rather than requiring the PPC to ramp up from zero.\t\n\nModel Efficiency Features\nIn order to improve study efficiency and model compatibility the following efficiency features are requested.  Note that no feature should compromise model accuracy.\n25\tModel is embedded into the PSCAD Template published at: https://www.ercot.com/services/rq/re\n\n26\tModel is correctly connected to the Template and inputs real power reference (Pref), voltage setpoint (Vref), and initial reactive reference (Qref).  Model exports trip signals.\t\n27\tBe compiled using Intel Fortran compiler and capable of running in Intel Fortran version 15 and higher and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and higher. Should not require a specific version of Intel Fortran and should support the new Intel OneAPI HPC free Fortran compiler.  \t\n28\tProvide 32-bit and 64-bit versions of libraries.  As of 2025, Intel has discontinued their 32-bit Fortran compiler.\t\n29\tCompatible with PSCAD version 5.0.1 and higher.\t\n30\tInitialize quickly under 5 seconds to user supplied terminal conditions.\t\n31\tSupport multiple instances of its own definition in the same simulation case for situations where the same inverter resource is used at multiple sites.\t\n32\tSupport the PSCAD \u201csnapshot\u201d feature.\t\n33\tSupport the PSCAD \u201cmultiple run\u201d feature.\t\n34\tAllow replication in different PSCAD cases or libraries through the \u201ccopy\u201d or \u201ccopy transfer\u201d features.\t\n\n\n(Sample Verification Report)\n\nResource Name:  TURTLE GENERATION STATION\tDate of this Report: 8/7/2023\nDate(s) Field Settings Checked at Plant:\n5/2023:  Protection and PSS settings \n6/2022:  Date of MOD-026/027 Reports\tNames of Reference Documents (attached):\nTurtle MOD-026/027 Reports\nTurtle commissioning models\n\n\nGeneral Description:\n\nThis report is submitted to support the model parameters for the TURTLE GENERATING STATION.  The Governor and Exciter and Stabilizer models were checked through testing in the MOD-026/-027 reports.  In May of 2023, plant personnel downloaded the power system stabilizer and protection parameters to directly confirm the settings in those devices.  Tables of tunable or site-specific model parameters and their verified values are listed below.\n\n(Notes to the author writing this Verification report:\n1.\tThe new dynamic model Template contains a worksheet that can function as your verification report.  There is no need to prepare a separate report if you complete this worksheet and populate the field-verified data.\n2.\tYou can verify either your PSS/e or your PSCAD model.  However, if you verify the PSCAD model, please provide evidence you also confirmed the protection models in the PSS/e model, since these are not guaranteed to match when overlaying PSS/e versus PSCAD in the MQT report.\na.\tThe new dynamic model Template provides helpful tips on this one. \n3.\tFollow the instructions in the Model Quality Guide on submitting your models along with this report.  You must submit models when submitting a verification report.  This includes submitting both models, even if only verifying one or the other.)"

During Part 2 of the\ncommissioning process, ERCOT will require operational testing of both.\nERCOT has observed many plants needing to making field adjustments during commissioning. These\nadjustments sometimes conflict with performance objectives in the Model Quality Testing, resulting in\nadditional model updates, and ultimately, a second round of field adjustments and testing.\nInterconnecting Entities can usually avoid these complications by ensuring that the models are\naccurate representations of the future facility and subjecting the models to AVR and PFR tests during\nthe planning stage. This requires precise modeling of any switched shunt and transformer tap\ncontrollers and ensuring they are well coordinated with protection settings and the generator reactive\ncontroller. To facilitate this effort, ERCOT is strongly encouraging all resources to model such\ncontrollers and provide initialization scripts in PSS/e (Python format) to ensure that the taps\nand switched shunts are initialized in the correct position for power flow initial conditions (real\nand reactive dispatch, POI voltage, etc.). When reviewing submitted models, ERCOT has often\nneeded to reach out regarding an MQT test reflecting poor performance. The Resource Entities (REs)\nreaches out to their consultant, who investigates and finds that the switched shunts were not initialized\nin the proper position. ERCOT must then re-review the model. This inefficient back-and-forth can\nagain be avoided by REs who provide accurate models of their shunt / tap controllers.\n\u2022 Nodal Operating Guide 2.7.3.5(4) requires plants to regulate their POIB voltage within a tight\ntolerance. For example, externally applying a 4 kV voltage step at a 345 kV POIB should result in\nthe model\u2019s voltage regulator transitioning the model to maximum reactive power exchange\n(generally better than 0.95 power factor). Thus, it is recommended to model test applying the\nfollowing voltage steps to the POIB: \u00b14 kV step for a 345 kV POIB, \u00b12 kV for a 138 kV POIB, and\na \u00b11 kV for a 69 kV POIB.\n\u2022 Refer here for a sample IRR AVR test.

This includes WECC \u201cGeneric\u201d\nmodels and most synchronous power plant models\n\u2022 User-Defined Models (UDM) models may provide a more accurate response\n\u2022 UDM require .DLL files from the OEM for PSS/E and .DLL and .TUDM files for TSAT\n\u2022 UDM typically require update with each new version of software*\n\u2022 UDM models should adhere to the enclosed ERCOT UDM Guideline\n\u2022 Either UDM or Std. Library/Generic are acceptable for ERCOT and for MOD 26/27 studies\n\u2022 Generic WECC models should be confirmed by the manufacturer\n* In many cases, this update effort is minimal. Manufacturers compile an updated version of their .DLL file. The parameters\nrepresenting site-specific settings may remain the same in which case the MQT report would not require updating.\nFigure 3: Model Types\nERCOT requires models to be provided supporting PSS/E and TSAT software and also requires\nPSCAD models for IBRs (e.g., wind / solar / battery resources). These models are typically furnished\nby the device manufacturer and should reflect the site-specific settings and layout of the plant all the\nway up to the Point of Interconnection (POI). The stability models for can be of either UDM or Standard\nLibrary/Generic type. Both types are acceptable for use in MOD 26/27 studies. See discussion on\nthe next page.\n\u00a9 2025 ERCOT 10\nAll rights reserved.\nERCOT Dynamic Model Submittal Guideline ERCOT Public\nA Caution about Generic Models and MOD 026/027 Studies\nMany REs appear to be using generic models for their MOD 26/27 studies. While not prohibited,\nERCOT has observed a high proportion of these models not yielding acceptable response, are no\nlonger passing Voltage Ride Through, or have a response that is markedly different than the original\nUDM model without providing technical rationale. Per the rules in Planning Guide Section 6, ERCOT\nwill reject such models. Please refer to the enclosed presentation.\nThe cause of this problem is perhaps rooted in the fact that generic models are lower fidelity models\nand necessitate great care in choosing appropriate parameters. The expertise necessary to convert\nfrom a UDM model to a generic model usually requires involvement of the manufacturer and is\nsometimes not within the expertise of 3rd party consultants advertising MOD 26/27 services.\nIn the ERCOT region, UDM models are allowed for MOD 26/27 studies and there is no requirement\nthat generic models must be used. ERCOT DWG has adopted the \u201cunacceptable\u201d portion of the NERC\nAcceptable Models List3\n.\n4 Thus REs may use any model that NERC has not classified as unacceptable\nincluding models not appearing on the NERC list.\nERCOT recommends Resource or Interconnecting Entities providing a generic model to obtain\nconfirmation from their equipment manufacturer to ensure that the generic model is appropriate.\nDynamic Model Templates\nDynamic stability (PSSE/TSAT) and transient (PSCAD) models are submitted to ERCOT using model\ntemplates. The templates are downloadable from the ERCOT Resource Entity webpage:\n\u2192 https://www.ercot.com/services/rq/re\nThe posted templates support a wide range of manufacturers and technologies. If you find that your\ndynamic model is not supported by the posted templates, contact dynamicmodels@ercot.com and put\nthe phrase \u201cTemplate Issue\u201d in the email subject.\nAny updated PSCAD models should be submitted in PSCAD Template format. The PSCAD Template\nis stored in the same zip file as the dynamic model Templates. There is an included slide tutorial.\n3 NERC Acceptable Models List, https://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/ModelAssessment/Pages/default.aspx\n4 ERCOT rule regarding acceptable models: Refer to Section 3.1.9 of the DWG Procedure Manual, posted at\nhttps://www.ercot.com/committees/ros/dwg\n\u00a9 2025 ERCOT 11\nAll rights reserved.\nERCOT Dynamic Model Submittal Guideline ERCOT Public\nThe Model Quality Test\nThe model quality test is designed to help a Resource or Interconnecting Entity test their model before\nsubmitting to ERCOT. This helps ensure the model meets requirements and reduces arduous back\nand forth communication and corrections. Two optional tools are provided to facilitate testing:\nDMVIEW for PSS/E and PMVIEW for PSCAD. (No tool is currently provided for TSAT however it is\nstraightforward to set up using the TSAT injection function. Search for \u201cVoltage and Frequency/Angle\nInjection Data\u201d in the TSAT Model Manual.) At the conclusion of the test, the Resource or\nInterconnecting Entity provides a test report and testing files to ERCOT via RIOO.\n\u2022 Model quality tests must be performed using the current version of the Planning\nSoftware (ref. DWG Manual 3.1.5.1). DWG is in the process of transitioning to PSS/e\nversion 36; thus, the MQT may be run in either PSS/e version 35 or PSS/e version 36. The\ncurrent version of PSCAD is version 4.5 or higher (ref. DWG Manual 3.1.1).\n\u2022 Model quality tests must be provided whenever providing a new or updated PSS/E, TSAT, or\nPSCAD model.\no Standard library/generic models are not required to provide an MQT report testing\nthe model in TSAT. User-defined models (UDM) are required to provide an MQT\nreport testing the model in TSAT as well as PSS/E.\n\u2022 In most situations, the PSS/E, TSAT and PSCAD models should be updated at the same\ntime. Please overlay the PSS/E-TSAT-PSCAD MQT plots to facilitate comparison.\n\u2022 For synchronous plants, a MOD 26/27 test report plus TSP usability report of the same\nmodel may fulfill ERCOT\u2019s model quality test requirements. However, for inverter-based\nresources, MOD 26/27 reports do not fulfill the MQT requirements.\n\u2022 Resources should perform model quality testing at the same time as conducting MOD 26/27.\nThe table below summarizes the required MQT tests for each type of facility:\nHybrid Facility\n(battery + other\ngenerator)\nSolar or Wind Battery only (ESR) Self-Limited (SLF)\nHybrid Facility\nRun all MQT tests at\nRun all MQT tests at\nRun all MQT tests under\nRun all MQT tests under\n100% generation unless\n100% charging and again\nthe following 4 scenarios:\nthe following 4 scenarios:\nindicated otherwise by the\nat 100% discharging\n\u2022 Standalone battery\n\u2022 Standalone battery\ntest (e.g. most frequency\nunless otherwise indicated\ncharging\ncharging\ntests run at 80%)\nby the test.\n\u2022 Standalone battery\n\u2022 Standalone battery\ndischarging\ndischarging\n\u2022 Standalone generator\n\u2022 Standalone generator\nwith battery offline\nwith battery offline\n\u2022 Battery discharging +\n\u2022 Battery discharging at\n100% generation\n50% plus generator at\n50% (adjust if\nnecessary to respect\nlimit)\n\u00a9 2025 ERCOT 12\nAll rights reserved.\nERCOT Dynamic Model Submittal Guideline ERCOT Public\nHybrid plants consisting of an energy storage system (\u201cESS\u201d) plus some other generation resource\n(\u201cnon-ESS\u201d) are required to run a combined MQT and submit combined models if any of the\nfollowing apply:\n\u2022 The different components share one or more main power transformers\n\u2022 The different components share a common control system, such as a master power plant\ncontroller\n\u2022 If neither of these apply, then the hybrid plant may submit separate models and separate\nMQTs of the ESS and of the non-ESS.

Details on the model quality test can be\nfound in the most recent DWG Procedure Manual, Section 3.1.5 posted at:\n\u2192 https://www.ercot.com/committees/ros/dwg\nThe DWG Procedure Manual Section 3.1.5 contains information:\n\u2022 How to set up the simulation\n\u2022 Types of tests to perform\n\u2022 Test criteria\n\u2022 Example plots\nUsing DMVIEW\nDynamic Model reView (DMVIEW) is an optional external tool that can be used to perform model\ntesting in PSS/E. Download the tool from:\n\u2192 https://sites.google.com/view/dmview/home\nBefore using DMVIEW, you must have a working dynamic case with your plant modeled up to the\nPoint of Interconnection (POI). Please refer to the DMVIEW manual for complete instructions as\nwell as the DWG Procedure Manual Section 3.1.5 for how to set up the case. Some helpful tips are\nprovided here.\n1. Copy your model files to a new folder under the CASEs folder. Follow the DMVIEW Program\nManual instructions to place a slack generator connected to the POI bus by a zero-impedance\nline. Tip: ERCOT has found that adding a very small amount of impedance to the zero-\nimpedance line will facilitate setting an initial reactive flow. For example, use a value of 0.001\nreactance.\na. The generator is connected to the medium voltage bus by the appropriate transformers\nand collector system equivalent. Note: You must use an aggregate model (i.e. do not\nmodel individual wind turbines or solar inverters). Several methods exist for calculating\nthe equivalent collector impedance; see for instance the NREL/WECC method5\n.\nb. Refer to the DWG Procedure Manual Section 3.1.5 for information on setting up the\ninitial voltage schedule and dispatch.\ni. For most of the tests, you can set up an initial 0 MVAr reactive exchange at\nthe POI. A convenient way to achieve this is to set the voltage schedules of\nthe slack generator and test generator to 1.0 per-unit and set the test generator\nto regulate the POI bus. For the lead and lag Voltage Ride Through tests\n(LVRT/HVRT), you can modify the voltage schedule of the test generator\nslightly to achieve a desired reactive dispatch at the POI or the latest version\nof DMVIEW accepts POI_\nPF = 0.95 command in the INI file for lagging\nand -0.95 for leading. Tip: Assign the \u201czero impedance\u201d branch a slight non-\nzero impedance, say 0.001 reactance, to facilitate voltage control initialization.\nc. Ensure that the powerflow solves.\n5 E.

One benefit over other tools is that it will perform most tests in one button click\nusing the PSCAD multi-run block. Download the tool from:\n\u2794 https://sites.google.com/view/pmview\nBefore using PMVIEW, you must have a working PSCAD case with your plant modeled up to the\nPoint of Interconnection (POI). A brief manual is included in the download. More help is available\nonce the tool is opened in PSCAD; the tool has numerous comment boxes to guide you through\nusage.\nUnacceptable Test Results per the DWG Procedure Manual\nIf you find that your model is unacceptable and it is for an existing resource, provide a description of\nthe issue, including whether the shortcoming is limited to the model or whether the shortcoming really\nexists in the field. Your priority is to first provide an accurate model of your resource as it exists in the\nfield. Then afterwards, develop a plan to correct the shortcoming. Provide a proposed model\nillustrating the corrected response to ERCOT for review along with an estimated timeline. After\nadjustments are made, a new PSS/E / TSAT / PSCAD model, model quality test reports, and\nverification report should be submitted.\nA special note on the frequency tests\nRenewable generators typically operate in a \u201cpower availability\u201d state without headroom. Thus, there\nwill be no response to a low frequency event unless the plant is curtailed (i.e., has headroom). By\ndefault, the model should be set up to interpret PGEN < PMAX to mean that power availability is less\nthan capability (e.g., wind speed or solar insolation is lower than maximum) so the model should not\nrespond to a low frequency event. There should be some means to enable headroom (such as a\nswitch or flag in the dynamic model) to tell the model to instead interpret PGEN < PMAX to mean that\nthe facility is curtailed. The dynamic model should not require adjusting PMAX to indicate whether\nheadroom is available. A flag in the dynamic model would be the preferred means to indicate\nheadroom availability. (This discussion only applies to renewable units; for conventional units the\ndifference between PGEN and the temperature-compensated PMAX is typically available to the\ngovernor for frequency response.)\nERCOT requires that all intermittent renewable (IRR) models be able to operate in the \u201cno headroom\u201d\nstate and this be the default setting when the model is received. If the model is not currently capable\nof being switched for headroom / no headroom, then this limitation should be explained in the quality\nreport with a note when the feature will be added.\n\u00a9 2025 ERCOT 17\nAll rights reserved.\nERCOT Dynamic Model Submittal Guideline ERCOT Public\nDeliverables\nModels and Verification reports should be submitted to ERCOT\u2019s RIOO-RS portal:\n\u2022 Select your plant or station and begin a New Change Request. The type of Change Request\nshould be an \u201cAttachment Only\u201d change request.\n\u2022 Upload all files as attachments. Compressed .zip file format works best. The maximum size\nper file is approximately 60 MB so it may be necessary to split large files into smaller files by\nun-zipping them first and re-zipping them.\n\u2022 Be sure to upload all plant models, manuals, and reports to the change request, even\nmodels that are not being changed (Refer to Section 1 of this document, ERCOT Dynamic\nModel Requirements). Thus, for example, if you are updating the PSS/E model, then please\nattach your latest PSCAD model as well for IBR plants. To indicate whether a model is being\nupdated, please indicate the model update date in the filename. For example, a PSCAD\nmodel which was last updated December 27th 2018 for Sitecode Turtle should be named\n\u201cTURTLE_PSCAD_2018-12-27.zip\u201d Refer below for file naming instructions.\n\u2022 If you have difficulties using RIOO-RS, first see the RIOO guides posted at\nhttps://www.ercot.com/services/rq/re and, if that does not resolve your issue, then email\nRIOO-help@ercot.com. If all else fails, reach out to your ERCOT client services account\nmanager asking to submit files an MIS service request.
