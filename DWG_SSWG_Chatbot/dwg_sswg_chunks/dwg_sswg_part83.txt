4.5.1.4	Transformer Ratings
The ratings used for transformer are defined the same as the ratings used for branches described in Section 4.4.1.4.
4.5.1.5	Status
Transformer data records include a field for status.  Entities are allowed to submit transformer data with an out-of-service status for equipment normally out of service.   
4.5.1.6	Ownership
Up to four owners and corresponding percent ownership can be specified for each transformer in the SSWG Cases. Owner IDs and corresponding percent ownership should be included for all transformers. The sum of all percent ownerships should equal 100% for every transformer.
4.5.1.7	Angle
In PSS®E, the phase shift across a two-winding transformer is specified by an angle referenced to the winding defined as “winding 1” by the combined logic of the “From Bus Number”, “To Bus Number” and “Winding 1 Side” (From or To logic) fields.  The phase shift angle is positive when the voltage of the bus corresponding to the refer
