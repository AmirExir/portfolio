	Unacceptable Dynamic Models 
The DWG adopted a list of unacceptable dynamic models developed by the NERC System Analysis and Modeling Subcommittee (SAMS) with exception of those models for which DWG has a technical justification not to adopt.  
	Unacceptable models that already exist in the ERCOT dynamic dataset shall be phased out through dynamic model updates including updates received via the NERC MOD-026-1 and MOD-027-1 processes.
	If a generation interconnection or dynamic model update has begun prior to a model being identified as unacceptable by NERC, the model may be allowed. 
	The list of acceptable/unacceptable dynamic models are published on the NERC website.
