These organizations and Entities shall comply with the requirements set forth in this Planning Guide. \n(3)\tIn the event of a conflict between the Planning Guide and Protocols, any PUCT Substantive Rules or the NERC Reliability Standards, then such PUCT Substantive Rules, NERC Reliability Standards, and the Protocols shall control. \n(4)\tFor application in the ERCOT Region, some NERC Reliability Standards must be adapted to fit the unique characteristics of ERCOT.  Defined terminology for NERC Regional Variances, if any, is detailed in the NERC Reliability Standards.\t\n1.2\tProcess for Planning Guide Revision\n1.2.1\tIntroduction\n(1)\tA request to make additions, edits, deletions, revisions, or clarifications to this Planning Guide, including any attachments and exhibits to this Planning Guide, is called a Planning Guide Revision Request (PGRR).  Except as specifically provided in other sections of this Planning Guide, this Section 1.2, Process for Planning Guide Revision, shall be followed for all PGRRs.  ERCOT Members, Market Participants, Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) Staff, the Reliability Monitor, the Independent Market Monitor (IMM), the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Regional Entity, ERCOT, and any other Entities are required to utilize the process described herein prior to requesting, throu",

As such, the ROS will monitor all changes to the ERCOT Protocols and initiate any PGRRs necessary to bring the Planning Guides in conformance with the ERCOT Protocols.  The ROS will also initiate a Nodal Protocol Revision Request (NPRR) if such a change is necessary to accommodate a proposed PGRR prior to proceeding with that PGRR.\n(4)\tThroughout the Planning Guide, references are made to the ERCOT Protocols.  ERCOT Protocols supersede the Planning Guide and any PGRR must be compliant with the Protocols.  The ERCOT Protocols are subject to the revision process outlined in Protocol Section 21, Revision Request Process.\n(5)\tERCOT may make non-substantive corrections at any time during the processing of a particular PGRR.  Under certain circumstances, however, the Planning Guide can also be revised by ERCOT rather than using the PGRR process outlined in Section 1.2.\n(a)\tThis type of revision is referred to as an \u201cAdministrative PGRR\u201d or \u201cAdministrative Changes\u201d and shall consist of non-substantive corrections, such as typos (excluding grammatical changes), internal references (including table of contents), improper use of acronyms, references to ERCOT Protocols, PUCT Substantive Rules, the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA), NERC regulations, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rules, etc., and revisions for the purpose of maintaining consistency between Section 1.2 and Protocol Section 21. \n(b)\tERCOT shall post such Administrative PGRRs to the ERCOT website and distribute the PGRR to ROS.  If no Entity submits comments to the Administrative PGRR within ten Business Days in accordance with paragraph (1) of Section 1.2.3.3, ROS Review and Action, the Administrative PGRR shall be subject to PUCT approval.  Following PUCT approval, ERCOT shall implement the Administrative PGRR according to paragraph (3) of Section 1.2.5, Planning Guide Revision Implementation.  If any Entity submits comments to the Administrative PGRR, then it shall be processed in accordance with the PGRR process outlined in Section 1.2.\n1.2.2\tSubmission of a Planning Guide Revision Request\n(1)\tThe following Entities m",

The study uses scenario analysis techniques to assess the potential needs of the ERCOT System up to 20 years into the future.  The role of the LTSA is not to recommend the construction of specific system upgrades, due to the high degree of uncertainty associated with the amount and location of loads and Resources in this timeframe.  Instead, the role of the LTSA is to evaluate the system upgrades that are indicated under each of a wide variety of scenarios in order to identify upgrades that are robust across a range of scenarios or might be more economic than the upgrades that would be determined considering only needs of Years 1 to 6 in the Regional Transmission Plan development.\n[PGRR116:  Insert paragraph (2) below upon system implementation of NPRR1240:]\n(2)\tERCOT shall post the LTSA as follows:\n(a)\tVersions that include ERCOT Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (ECEII) shall be posted on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area;\n(b)\tVersions that include both ECEII and Protected Information shall be posted on the MIS Certified Area for Transmission Service Providers (TSPs) only; and\n(c)\tVersions redacted of ECEII and Protected Information shall be posted on the ERCOT website.\n\n3.1.1.2\tRegional Transmission Plan\n(1)\tThe Regional Transmission Plan is developed annually by ERCOT, in coordination with the RPG and Transmission Service Providers (TSPs).

These planned improvements include projects previously approved by the ERCOT Board, projects previously reviewed by the RPG, new projects that will be refined at the appropriate time by TSPs in order to complete RPG review, and the local projects currently planned by TSPs.  Combined, these projects represent ERCOT\u2019s plan which addresses the reliability and efficiency of the ERCOT System in order to meet North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards, the Protocols, Nodal Operating Guides and this Planning Guide.

In the case of Tier 1 and 2 projects, any differences in expected ERCOT System production costs between the alternatives may be included in the consideration of the relative costs of the alternatives, due to larger potential impacts on losses and congestion of these projects.\n3.1.4\tRegional Transmission Plan Development Process\n(1)\tAs prescribed by Section 3.1.1.2, Regional Transmission Plan, the purpose of the Regional Transmission Plan is to provide a coordinated plan for the ERCOT System.  This Section describes the process used by ERCOT to develop the Regional Transmission Plan.  While unanticipated changes in Load and generation may require additional projects to be needed that were not included in the current Regional Transmission Plan, or require additional evaluation of projects included in the current Regional Transmission Plan when they are submitted for RPG Project Review, the Regional Transmission Plan provides a reasonable and supportable basis for analyses of the planned ERCOT Transmission Grid.   \n3.1.4.1\tDevelopment of Regional Transmission Plan\n(1)\tThe planning process begins with computer modeling studies of the generation and Transmission Facilities and substation Loads under normal conditions in the ERCOT System.  Contingency conditions along with changes in Load and generation that might be expected to occur in operation of the ERCOT Transmission Grid are also modeled.  To maintain adequate service and minimize interruptions during Outages, model simulations are used to identify adverse results based upon the planning criteria and to examine the effectiveness of various problem-solving alternatives.\n(2)\tThe effectiveness of each alternative will be evaluated under a variety of possible operating environments because Loads and operating conditions cannot be predicted with certainty.  As a result, repeated simulations under different conditions are often required.  In addition, options considered for future installation may affect other alternatives so that several different combinations must be evaluated, thereby multiplying the number of simulations required.\n(3)\tOnce feasible alternatives have been identified, the process is continued with a comparison of those alternatives.  To determine the most favorable, the short-range and long-range benefits of each alternative must be considered including operating flexibility and compatibility with future plans.\n3.1.4.1.1\tRegional Transmission Plan Cases\n(1)\tThe starting base cases for the Regional Transmission Plan development are created by removin",
