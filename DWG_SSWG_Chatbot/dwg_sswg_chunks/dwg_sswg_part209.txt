existing IBRs.
 
The following performance criteria apply:
	Plant real and reactive power output should be well controlled. The frequency and voltage should not oscillate excessively or deviate from steady-state levels for any significant amount of time. 

	Voltage should settle to a stable operating point when the frequency is not ramping 

	The equivalent inertia constant, as calculated below, should be greater than 2.5 s. 

	H ≈ 60 * ∆E [s], where: ∆E is the area under the per unit active power production of the ESR from 0 to 0.5 s, when the RoCoF is 1 Hz/s. 

	Active power should settle according to its frequency droop and deadband settings when the frequency has settled. 

 

3.1.5.13 AGS-ESR System Strength Test
This test is similar to the existing system strength test for all IBRs, but AGS-ESR shall demonstrate a stable response for all tested SCR values from 10 down to 1.2. The test system should be set up with a SCR of 10 at the connection point with a X/R ratio of 6. The init
