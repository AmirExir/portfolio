LTC, along with the corresponding maximum and minimum turns ratio adjustment capabilities (i.e. Rmax and Rmin).  The transformer’s turns ratio step increment for a LTC can be calculated based upon data present in the “Tap Positions”, “Rmax”, and “Rmin” fields of the transformer’s PSS®E model.  A common range for a LTC turns ratio step increment is +/- 10 % over 33 tap positions (32 steps), which corresponds to 5/8% or 0.00625 per unit voltage increment per tap step.
4.5.1.8.7	Table
The number of a transformer impedance correction table is specified by this field if the transformer's impedance is to be a function of either the off-nominal turns ratio or phase shift angle. SSWG Cases normally don’t use these tables and this field is set to zero by default.
4.5.1.9	Magnetizing Admittance
Magnetizing admittance data is not required for SSWG Cases and the values for each of these two fields should be zero.
4.5.1.10	Load Drop Compensation
These two fields define the real and reactive impeda
