orage Resources (ESRs), the Hour Beginning Planned State of Charge (SOC) values provided in the COP for a given hour are discounted to ensure sufficient SOC is preserved to meet Ancillary Service Resource Responsibilities, as reflected in the COP.  Any remaining SOC on the ESR will be considered available for energy dispatch by RUC while respecting the Minimum State of Charge (MinSOC) and Maximum State of Charge (MaxSOC) values provided in the COP.
(2)	The RUC process can recommend Resource decommitment.  ERCOT may only decommit a Resource to resolve transmission constraints that are otherwise unresolvable. Qualifying Facilities (QFs) may be decommitted only after all other types of Resources have been assessed for decommitment.  In addition, the HRUC process provides decision support to ERCOT regarding a Resource decommitment requested by a Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE).  
(3)	ERCOT shall review the RUC-recommended Resource commitments and the list of Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less to assess feasibility and shall make any changes that it considers necessary, in its sole discretion.  During the RUC process, ERCOT may also review and commit, through a RUC instruction, Combined Cycle Generation Resources that are currently planned to be On-Line but are capable of transitioning to a configuration with additional capacity.  ERCOT may deselect Resources recommended in DRUC and in all HRUC processes if in ERCOT’s sole discretion there is enough time to commit those Resources in the future HRUC processes, taking into account the Resources’ start-up times, to meet ERCOT System reliability.  After each RUC run, ERCOT shall post the amount of capacity deselected per hour in the RUC Study Period to the MIS Secure Area.  A Generation Resource shown as On-Line and available for SCED dispatch for an hour in its COP prior to a DRUC or HRUC process execution, according to Section 5.3, ERCOT Security Sequence Responsibilities, will be considered self-committed for that hour.  For purpose of Settlement, snapshot data will be used as specified in paragraph (2) of Section 5.3.  ERCOT shall issue RUC instructions to each QSE specifying its Resources that have been committed as a result of the RUC process.  ERCOT shall, within one day after making any changes to the RUC-recommended commitments, post to the MIS Secure Area any changes that ERCOT made to the RUC-recommended commitments with an explanation of the changes.
[NPRR1239:  Replace paragraph (3) above with the following upon system implementation:]

A Generation Resource shown as On-Line and available for SCED dispatch for an hour in its COP prior to a DRUC or HRUC process execution, according to Section 5.3, ERCOT Security Sequence Responsibilities, will be considered self-committed for that hour.  For purpose of Settlement, snapshot data will be used as specified in paragraph (2) of Section 5.3.

ERCOT shall, within one day after making any changes to the RUC-recommended commitments, post to the ERCOT website any changes that ERCOT made to the RUC-recommended commitments with an explanation of the changes.
(4)	A QSE shall notify the ERCOT Operator of any physical limitation that impacts its Resource’s ability to start that is not reflected in the Resource’s COP or the Resource’s startup time, minimum On-Line time, or minimum Off-Line time.  The following shall apply:
(a)	If a Resource receives a RUC Dispatch Instruction that it cannot meet due to a physical limitation described in paragraph (4) above, the QSE representing the Resource shall notify the ERCOT Operator of the inability to fully comply with the instruction and shall comply with the instruction to the best of the Resource’s ability.  If the QSE has provided the ERCOT Operator notice of that limitation at least seven days prior to the Operating Day in which the instruction occurs, the QSE shall be excused from complying with the portion of the RUC Dispatch Instruction that it could not meet due to the identified limitation.  
(b)	If a QSE provides notice pursuant to paragraph (a) above of a physical limitation that will delay the RUC-committed Resource’s ability to reach its LSL in accordance with a RUC Dispatch Instruction, ERCOT shall extend the RUC Dispatch Instruction so that the Resource’s minimum run time is respected. However, if the Resource will not be available in time to address the issue for which it received the RUC instruction, ERCOT may instead cancel the RUC Dispatch Instruction.
(5)	A QSE shall be excused from complying with any portion of a RUC Dispatch Instruction that it could not meet due to a physical limitation that was reflected, at the time of the RUC Dispatch Instruction, in the Resource’s COP, startup time, minimum On-Line time, or minimum Off-Line time.
(6)	To determine the projected energy output level of each Resource and to project potential congestion patterns for each hour of the RUC, ERCOT shall calculate proxy Energy Offer Curves based on the Mitigated Offer Caps (MOCs) for the type of Resource as specified in Section 4.4.9.4, Mitigated Offer Cap and Mitigated Offer Floor, for use in the RUC.  Proxy Energy Offer Curves are calculated by multiplying the MOC by a constant selected by ERCOT from time to time that is no more than 0.10% and applying the cost for all Generation Resource output between High Sustained Limit (HSL) and LSL.  The intent of this process is to minimize the effect of the proxy Energy Offer Curves on optimization.
(7)	ERCOT shall use the RUC process to evaluate the need to commit Resources for which a QSE has submitted Three-Part Supply Offers and other available Off-Line Resources in addition to Resources that are planned to be On-Line during the RUC Study Period.  All of the above commitment information must be as specified in the QSE’s COP.  For available Off-Line Resources with a cold start time of one hour or less that have not been removed from special consideration under paragraph (9) below pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.2, Current Operating Plan (COP) Performance Requirements, the Startup Offers and Minimum-Energy Offer from a Resource’s Three-Part Supply Offer shall not be used in the RUC process. 
(8)	ERCOT shall create Three-Part Supply Offers for all Resources that did not submit a Three-Part Supply Offer, but are specified as available but Off-Line, excluding Resources with a Resource Status of EMR, in a QSE’s COP.  For such Resources, excluding available Off-Line Resources with a cold start time of one hour or less that have not been removed from special consideration under paragraph (9) below pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.2, ERCOT shall use in the RUC process 100% of any approved verifiable Startup Cost and verifiable minimum-energy cost or if verifiable costs have not been approved, the applicable Resource Category Generic Startup Offer Cost and the applicable Resource Category Generic Minimum-Energy Offer Cost as described specified in Section 4.4.9.2.3, Startup Offer and Minimum-Energy Offer Generic Caps, registered with ERCOT.  Also, for Settlement purposes, ERCOT shall use any approved verifiable Startup Costs and verifiable minimum-energy cost for such Resources, or if verifiable costs have not been approved, the applicable Resource Category Generic Startup Offer Cost and Generic Minimum-Energy Offer Cost.
(9)	For all available Off-Line Resources having a cold start time of one hour or less and not removed from special consideration pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.2, ERCOT shall scale any approved verifiable Startup Cost and verifiable minimum-energy cost or if verifiable costs have not been approved, the applicable Resource Category Generic Startup Offer Cost and the applicable Resource Category Generic Minimum-Energy Offer Cost as specified in Section 4.4.9.2.3 for use in the RUC process.  
The above parameter is defined as follows:
Parameter	Unit	Current Value*
1HRLESSCOSTSCALING	Percentage	Maximum value of 100%
*  The current value for the parameter(s) referenced in this table above will be recommended by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and approved by the ERCOT Board.  ERCOT shall update parameter value(s) on the first day of the month following ERCOT Board approval unless otherwise directed by the ERCOT Board.  ERCOT shall provide a Market Notice prior to implementation of a revised parameter value.
(10)	The RUC process must treat all Resource capacity providing Ancillary Service as unavailable for the RUC Study Period, unless that treatment leads to infeasibility (i.e., that capacity is needed to resolve some local transmission problem that cannot be resolved by any other means).  If an ERCOT Operator decides that the Ancillary Service capacity allocated to that Resource is infeasible based on ERCOT System conditions, then, ERCOT shall inform each affected QSE of the amount of its Resource capacity that does not qualify to provide Ancillary Service, and the projected hours for which this is the case.  In that event, the affected QSE may, under Section 6.4.9.1.2, Replacement of Infeasible Ancillary Service Due to Transmission Constraints, either:
(a)	Substitute capacity from Resources represented by that QSE;
(b)	Substitute capacity from other QSEs using Ancillary Service Trades; or 
(c)	Ask ERCOT to replace the capacity.   
(11)	Factors included in the RUC process are: 
(a)	ERCOT System-wide hourly Load forecast allocated appropriately over Load buses;
(b)	Transmission constraints – Transfer limits on energy flows through the electricity network;
(i)	Thermal constraints – protect transmission facilities against thermal overload;
(ii)	Generic constraints – protect the transmission system against transient instability, dynamic instability or voltage collapse;
(c)	Planned transmission topology;
(d)	Energy sufficiency constraints;
(e)	Inputs from the COP, as appropriate;
(f)	Inputs from Resource Parameters, including a list of Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less, as appropriate;
(g)	Each Generation Resource’s Minimum-Energy Offer and Startup Offer, from its Three-Part Supply Offer;
(h)	Any Generation Resource that is Off-Line and available but does not have a Three-Part Supply Offer;
(i)	Forced Outage information; and
(j)	Inputs from the eight-day look ahead planning tool, which may potentially keep a unit On-Line (or start a unit for the next day) so that a unit minimum duration between starts does not limit the availability of the unit (for security reasons).  
(12)	The HRUC process and the DRUC process are as follows:
(a)	The HRUC process uses current Resource Status for the initial condition for the first hour of the RUC Study Period.  All HRUC processes use the projected status of transmission breakers and switches starting with current status and updated for each remaining hour in the study as indicated in the COP for Resources and in the Outage Scheduler for transmission elements. 
(b)	The DRUC process uses the Day-Ahead forecast of total ERCOT Load including DC Tie Schedules for each hour of the Operating Day.  The HRUC process uses the current hourly forecast of total ERCOT Load including DC Tie Schedules for each hour in the RUC Study Period.
(c)	The DRUC process uses the Day-Ahead weather forecast for each hour of the Operating Day.  The HRUC process uses the weather forecast information for each hour of the balance of the RUC Study Period.
(13)	A QSE that has one or more of its Resources RUC-committed to provide Ancillary Services must increase its Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility by the total amount of RUC-committed Ancillary Service quantities.  The QSE may only use a RUC-committed Resource to meet its Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility during that Resource’s RUC-Committed Interval if the Resource has been committed by the RUC process to provide Ancillary Service, or the Resource is a Combined Cycle Generation Resource that was RUC-committed to transition from one On-Line configuration to a different configuration with additional capacity.  For cases in which the commitment was to provide Ancillary Service, the QSE shall indicate the exact amount and type of Ancillary Service for which it was committed as the Resource’s Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility and Ancillary Services Schedule for the RUC-Committed Intervals for both telemetry and COP information provided to ERCOT.  Upon deployment of the Ancillary Services, the QSE shall adjust its Ancillary Services Schedule to reflect the amounts requested in the deployment.
(14)	A QSE with a Resource that is not a Reliability Must-Run (RMR) Unit or has not received an Outage Schedule Adjustment (OSA) that has been committed in a DRUC or HRUC process may opt out of the RUC Settlement (or “buy back” the commitment) by setting the COP status of the RUC-committed Resource to ONOPTOUT for the first hour of a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours in the Opt Out Snapshot.  All the configurations of the same Combined Cycle Train shall be treated as the same Resource for the purpose of creating the block of RUC-Committed Hours.  A RUC-committed Combined Cycle Generation Resource may opt out of the RUC Settlement by setting the COP status of any Combined Cycle Generation Resource within the same Combined Cycle Train as the RUC-committed Resource to ONOPTOUT for the first hour of a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours in the Opt Out Snapshot.  A Combined Cycle Generation Resource that is RUC-committed from one On-Line configuration in order to transition to a different configuration with additional capacity may opt out of the RUC Settlement following the same rule for RUC-committed Combined Cycle Generation Resources described above.  A QSE that opts out of RUC Settlement forfeits RUC Settlement for the affected Resource for a given block of RUC Buy-Back Hours.  A QSE that opts out of RUC Settlement treatment must make the Resource available to SCED for all RUC Buy-Back Hours.  All hours in a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours that includes the RUC Buy-Back Hour shall be considered RUC Buy-Back Hours.  If a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours spans more than one Operating Day and a QSE wishes to opt out of RUC Settlement for the RUC-Committed Hours in the second or subsequent Operating Day, the QSE must set its COP status to ONOPTOUT for the first hour of the first Operating Day in the Opt Out Snapshot of the first Operating Day.
(15)	ERCOT shall, as soon as practicable, post to the MIS Secure Area a report identifying those hours that were considered RUC Buy-Back Hours, along with the name of each RUC-committed Resource whose QSE opted out of RUC Settlement.
[NPRR1239:  Replace paragraph (15) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(15)	ERCOT shall, as soon as practicable, post to the ERCOT website a report identifying those hours that were considered RUC Buy-Back Hours, along with the name of each RUC-committed Resource whose QSE opted out of RUC Settlement.
(16)	A Resource that has a Three-Part Supply Offer cleared in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) and subsequently receives a RUC commitment for the Operating Hour for which it was awarded will be treated as if the telemetered Resource Status was ONOPTOUT for purposes of Section 6.5.7.3, Security Constrained Economic Dispatch, and Section 6.5.7.3.1, Determination of Real-Time On-Line Reliability Deployment Price Adder.
(17)	A Resource that has self-committed for an Operating Hour after the RUC Snapshot was taken but before the RUC commitment has been communicated through an XML message for that RUC process and that Operating Hour is included in a block of RUC-committed hours for that RUC process will be treated as if the Resource Status was ONOPTOUT for purposes of Section 6.5.7.3, Section 6.5.7.3.1, Operating Reserve Demand Curve (ORDC) calculations, and RUC Settlement for the entire block of RUC-committed hours.  A QSE that has a Resource that meets these conditions must make the Resource available to SCED for the entire block of RUC-committed hours.  ERCOT will send the QSE a notification stating the Operating Day and block of hours for which this occurred.
[NPRR1009, NPRR1032, NPRR1204, NPRR1239, and NPRR1245:  Replace applicable portions of Section 5.5.2 above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project for NPRR1009, NPRR1204, and NPRR1245; or upon system implementation for NPRR1032 or NPRR1239:]
5.5.2	Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) Process
(1)	The RUC process recommends commitment of Generation Resources, to match ERCOT’s forecasted Load including Direct Current Tie (DC Tie) Schedules and RUC Ancillary Service Demand Curves (ASDCs), subject to all transmission constraints and Resource performance characteristics.  The RUC process takes into account Resources already committed in the Current Operating Plans (COPs), Resources already committed in previous RUCs, and Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less.  For On-Line Energy Storage Resources (ESRs), using RUC duration requirements for energy and Ancillary Services, RUC-projected dispatch for energy and Ancillary Service in one interval shall respect the ESR’s minimum and maximum State of Charge (SOC) values from the COP, while incorporating any adjustments under paragraph (19)(d) below.  In addition, using the Ancillary Service Deployment Factors and their respective deployment duration requirements, the SOC required to support these dispatch levels for energy and Ancillary Services will match as closely as possible the difference between the adjusted COP values of the next interval’s Hour Beginning Planned SOC and the current interval’s Hour Beginning Planned SOC.  The formulation of the RUC objective function must employ penalty factors on violations of security constraints and violations of ESR COP Hour Beginning Planned SOC.  The objective of the RUC process is to minimize costs based on the Resource costs described in paragraphs (11) through (15) below.  ESR energy dispatch costs and Ancillary Service Offer costs are not included in the RUC objective function.
(2)	ERCOT shall create an ASDC for each Ancillary Service for use in RUC.  ERCOT shall post the ASDCs to the ERCOT website as soon as practicable after any change to the ASDCs.
(3)	ERCOT shall post the following Ancillary Service Deployment Factor data on the ERCOT website:
(a)	Following each execution of RUC, ERCOT shall post the Ancillary Service Deployment Factors used by that RUC process for each hour in the RUC Study Period;
(b)	No later than 0600 in the Day-Ahead for each Operating Day, ERCOT shall post the Ancillary Service Deployments Factors that are projected to be used in the RUC process for that Operating Day; and
(c)	Following each month, ERCOT shall post the average, minimum, and maximum Ancillary Service Deployment Factors used in the RUC process by type of Ancillary Service and hour of the day for the month.
(4)	For all hours of the RUC Study Period within the RUC process, Quick Start Generation Resources (QSGRs) with a COP Resource Status of OFFQS shall be considered as On-Line with Low Sustained Limit (LSL) at zero MW.  QSGRs with a Resource Status of OFFQS shall only be committed by ERCOT through a RUC instruction in instances when a reliability issue would not otherwise be managed through Dispatch Instructions from Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED). 
(5)	In addition to On-Line qualified Generation Resources and ESRs, the RUC engine shall consider a COP Resource status of OFFQS for QSGRs that are qualified for ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service (ECRS), as being eligible to provide ECRS constrained by the Ancillary Service capability in the COP.
(6)	In addition to On-Line qualified Generation Resources and ESRs, the RUC engine shall consider a COP Resource Status of OFFQS for QSGRs that are qualified for Non-Spinning Reserve (Non-Spin), as being eligible to provide Non-Spin constrained by the Ancillary Service Capability in the COP.  The RUC engine shall also consider a COP Resource Status of OFF (Off-Line but available for commitment in the DAM and RUC) for a Resource that is qualified for Non-Spin, as being eligible to provide Non-Spin constrained by the Ancillary Service capability in the COP.
(7)	In addition to On-Line qualified Generation Resources and ESRs, the RUC engine shall consider a COP Resource Status of ONL for Load Resources that are qualified for Ancillary Services, as being eligible to provide Ancillary Services constrained by the Ancillary Service Capability in the COP.  The RUC engine will not consider any Load Resources for dispatch of energy.
(8)	The RUC process can recommend Resource decommitment.  ERCOT may only decommit a Resource to resolve transmission constraints that are otherwise unresolvable.  Qualifying Facilities (QFs) may be decommitted only after all other types of Resources have been assessed for decommitment.  In addition, the HRUC process provides decision support to ERCOT regarding a Resource decommitment requested by a Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE).  
(9)	ERCOT shall review the RUC-recommended Resource commitments and the list of Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less to assess feasibility and shall make any changes that it considers necessary, in its sole discretion.  During the RUC process, ERCOT may also review and commit, through a RUC instruction, Combined Cycle Generation Resources that are currently planned to be On-Line but are capable of transitioning to a configuration with additional capacity.  ERCOT may deselect Resources recommended in DRUC and in all HRUC processes if in ERCOT’s sole discretion there is enough time to commit those Resources in the future HRUC processes, taking into account the Resources’ start-up times, to meet ERCOT System reliability.  After each RUC run, ERCOT shall post the amount of capacity deselected per hour in the RUC Study Period to the ERCOT website.  A Generation Resource shown as On-Line and available for SCED dispatch for an hour in its COP prior to a DRUC or HRUC process execution, according to Section 5.3, ERCOT Security Sequence Responsibilities, will be considered self-committed for that hour.  For purpose of Settlement, snapshot data will be used as specified in paragraph (2) of Section 5.3.  
(10)	ERCOT shall issue RUC instructions to each QSE specifying its Resources that have been committed as a result of the RUC process.  ERCOT shall, within one day after making any changes to the RUC-recommended commitments, post to the ERCOT website any changes that ERCOT made to the RUC-recommended commitments with an explanation of the changes.
(11)	ERCOT shall use the RUC process to evaluate the need to commit Resources for which a QSE has submitted Three-Part Supply Offers and other available Off-Line Resources in addition to Resources that are planned to be On-Line during the RUC Study Period.  All of the above commitment information must be as specified in the QSE’s COP.  For available Off-Line Resources with a cold start time of one hour or less that have not been removed from special consideration under paragraph (17) below pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.2, Current Operating Plan (COP) Performance Requirements, the Startup Offers and Minimum-Energy Offer from a Resource’s Three-Part Supply Offer shall not be used in the RUC process. 
(12)	ERCOT shall create Three-Part Supply Offers for all Resources that did not submit a Three-Part Supply Offer, but are specified as available but Off-Line, excluding Resources with a Resource Status of EMR, in a QSE’s COP.  For such Resources, excluding available Off-Line Resources with a cold start time of one hour or less that have not been removed from special consideration under paragraph (15) below pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.2, ERCOT shall use in the RUC process 100% of any approved verifiable Startup Cost and verifiable minimum-energy cost or if verifiable costs have not been approved, the applicable Resource Category Generic Startup Offer Cost and the applicable Resource Category Generic Minimum-Energy Offer Cost as described specified in Section 4.4.9.2.3, Startup Offer and Minimum-Energy Offer Generic Caps, registered with ERCOT.  Also, for Settlement purposes, ERCOT shall use any approved verifiable Startup Costs and verifiable minimum-energy cost for such Resources, or if verifiable costs have not been approved, the applicable Resource Category Generic Startup Offer Cost and Generic Minimum-Energy Offer Cost.
(13)	A QSE shall notify the ERCOT Operator of any physical limitation that impacts its Resource’s ability to start that is not reflected in the Resource’s COP or the Resource’s startup time, minimum On-Line time, or minimum Off-Line time.  The following shall apply:
(a)	If a Resource receives a RUC Dispatch Instruction that it cannot meet due to a physical limitation described in paragraph (5) above, the QSE representing the Resource shall notify the ERCOT Operator of the inability to fully comply with the instruction and shall comply with the instruction to the best of the Resource’s ability.  If the QSE has provided the ERCOT Operator notice of that limitation at least seven days prior to the Operating Day in which the instruction occurs, the QSE shall be excused from complying with the portion of the RUC Dispatch Instruction that it could not meet due to the identified limitation.  
(b)	If a QSE provides notice pursuant to paragraph (a) above of a physical limitation that will delay the RUC-committed Resource’s ability to reach its LSL in accordance with a RUC Dispatch Instruction, ERCOT shall extend the RUC Dispatch Instruction so that the Resource’s minimum run time is respected. However, if the Resource will not be available in time to address the issue for which it received the RUC instruction, ERCOT may instead cancel the RUC Dispatch Instruction.
(14)	A QSE shall be excused from complying with any portion of a RUC Dispatch Instruction that it could not meet due to a physical limitation that was reflected, at the time of the RUC Dispatch Instruction, in the Resource’s COP, startup time, minimum On-Line time, or minimum Off-Line time.
(15)	To determine the projected energy output level of each Resource and to project potential congestion patterns for each hour of the RUC, ERCOT shall calculate proxy Energy Offer Curves based on the Mitigated Offer Caps (MOCs) for the type of Resource as specified in Section 4.4.9.4, Mitigated Offer Cap and Mitigated Offer Floor, for use in the RUC.  Proxy Energy Offer Curves are calculated by multiplying the MOC by a constant selected by ERCOT from time to time that is no more than 0.10% and applying the cost for all Generation Resource output between High Sustained Limit (HSL) and LSL.  The intent of this process is to minimize the effect of the proxy Energy Offer Curves on optimization.  For ESRs, energy dispatch costs are not considered in determining projected energy output levels.
(16)	ERCOT shall calculate proxy Ancillary Service Offer Curves for use in RUC based on validated Ancillary Service Offers as specified in Section 4.4.7.2, Ancillary Service Offers.  For all Resources that do not have a valid Ancillary Service Offer but are qualified to provide an Ancillary Service, ERCOT shall create an Ancillary Service Offer Curve for use in RUC as described in Section 6.5.7.3, Security Constrained Economic Dispatch.  Proxy Ancillary Service Offer Curves for use in RUC are calculated by multiplying the Ancillary Service Offer by a constant selected by ERCOT from time to time that is no more than 0.1%, and are extended between the HSL and LSL.  Notwithstanding the presence or absence of a proxy Ancillary Service Offer, Ancillary Service provision in RUC shall be limited by the Resource’s Ancillary Service capabilities as reflected in the COP.  For ESRs, Ancillary Service Offer costs are not considered in determining projected Ancillary Service awards.
(17)	For all available Off-Line Resources having a cold start time of one hour or less and not removed from special consideration pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.2, ERCOT shall scale any approved verifiable Startup Cost and verifiable minimum-energy cost or if verifiable costs have not been approved, the applicable Resource Category Generic Startup Offer Cost and the applicable Resource Category Generic Minimum-Energy Offer Cost as specified in Section 4.4.9.2.3 for use in the RUC process.  
The above parameter is defined as follows:
Parameter	Unit	Current Value*
1HRLESSCOSTSCALING	Percentage	Maximum value of 100%
*  The current value for the parameter(s) referenced in this table above will be recommended by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and approved by the ERCOT Board.  ERCOT shall update parameter value(s) on the first day of the month following ERCOT Board approval unless otherwise directed by the ERCOT Board.  ERCOT shall provide a Market Notice prior to implementation of a revised parameter value.
(18)	Factors included in the RUC process are: 
(a)	ERCOT System-wide hourly Load forecast allocated appropriately over Load buses;
(b)	ERCOT’s Ancillary Service Plans in the form of ASDCs;
(c)	Transmission constraints – Transfer limits on energy flows through the electricity network;
(i)	Thermal constraints – protect transmission facilities against thermal overload;
(ii)	Generic constraints – protect the transmission system against transient instability, dynamic instability or voltage collapse;
(d)	Planned transmission topology;
(e)	Energy sufficiency constraints, including RUC duration requirements for energy and Ancillary Services;
(f)	Inputs from the COP, as appropriate;
(g)	Inputs from Resource Parameters, including a list of Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less, as appropriate;
(h)	Each Generation Resource’s Minimum-Energy Offer and Startup Offer, from its Three-Part Supply Offer;
(i)	Any Generation Resource that is Off-Line and available but does not have a Three-Part Supply Offer;
(j)	Forced Outage information;
(k)	Inputs from the eight-day look ahead planning tool, which may potentially keep a unit On-Line (or start a unit for the next day) so that a unit minimum duration between starts does not limit the availability of the unit (for security reasons); and
(l)	Ancillary Service Deployment Factors. 
(19)	The HRUC process and the DRUC process are as follows:
(a)	The HRUC process uses current Resource Status for the initial condition for the first hour of the RUC Study Period.  All HRUC processes use the projected status of transmission breakers and switches starting with current status and updated for each remaining hour in the study as indicated in the COP for Resources and in the Outage Scheduler for transmission elements. 
(b)	The DRUC process uses the current hourly forecast of total ERCOT Load including DC Tie Schedules up to the physical rating of the DC Tie for each hour of the Operating Day.  The HRUC process uses the current hourly forecast of total ERCOT Load including DC Tie Schedules up to the physical rating of the DC Tie for each hour in the RUC Study Period.
(c)	The DRUC process uses the Day-Ahead weather forecast for each hour of the Operating Day.  The HRUC process uses the weather forecast information for each hour of the balance of the RUC Study Period.
(d)	For the HRUC, DRUC, and Weekly Reliability Unit Commitment (WRUC) processes, a feasibility check on the COP submitted Hour Beginning Planned SOC will be performed.  This check may adjust the Hour Beginning Planned SOC used in the RUC process.  The feasibility check looks sequentially across all intervals in the RUC Study Period to validate whether a particular interval’s COP Hour Beginning Planned SOC is achievable from the previous interval.  If it is not feasible, then RUC will adjust the Hour Beginning Planned SOC to the closest achievable value.
(20)	A QSE with a Resource that is not a Reliability Must-Run (RMR) Unit or has not received an Outage Schedule Adjustment (OSA) that has been committed in a DRUC or HRUC process may opt out of the RUC Settlement (or “buy back” the commitment) by setting the COP status of the RUC-committed Resource to ONOPTOUT for the first hour of a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours in the Opt Out Snapshot.  All the configurations of the same Combined Cycle Train shall be treated as the same Resource for the purpose of creating the block of RUC-Committed Hours.  A RUC-committed Combined Cycle Generation Resource may opt out of the RUC Settlement by setting the COP status of any Combined Cycle Generation Resource within the same Combined Cycle Train as the RUC-committed Resource to ONOPTOUT for the first hour of a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours in the Opt Out Snapshot.  A Combined Cycle Generation Resource that is RUC-committed from one On-Line configuration in order to transition to a different configuration with additional capacity may opt out of the RUC Settlement following the same rule for RUC-committed Combined Cycle Generation Resources described above.  A QSE that opts out of RUC Settlement forfeits RUC Settlement for the affected Resource for a given block of RUC Buy-Back Hours.  A QSE that opts out of RUC Settlement treatment must make the Resource available to SCED for all RUC Buy-Back Hours.  All hours in a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours that includes the RUC Buy-Back Hour shall be considered RUC Buy-Back Hours.  If a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours spans more than one Operating Day and a QSE wishes to opt out of RUC Settlement for the RUC-Committed Hours in the second or subsequent Operating Day, the QSE must set its COP status to ONOPTOUT for the first hour of that the first Operating Day in the Opt Out Snapshot of the first Operating Day.
(21)	ERCOT shall, as soon as practicable, post to the ERCOT website a report identifying those hours that were considered RUC Buy-Back Hours, along with the name of each RUC-committed Resource whose QSE opted out of RUC Settlement.
(22)	A Resource that has a Three-Part Supply Offer cleared in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) and subsequently receives a RUC commitment for the Operating Hour for which it was awarded will be treated as if the Resource Status was ONOPTOUT for purposes of Section 6.5.7.3 and Section 6.5.7.3.1, Determination of Real-Time Reliability Deployment Price Adders.
(23)	A Resource that has self-committed for an Operating Hour after the RUC Snapshot was taken but before the RUC commitment has been communicated through an XML message for that RUC process and that Operating Hour is included in a block of RUC-committed hours for that RUC process will be treated as if the Resource Status was ONOPTOUT for purposes of Section 6.5.7.3, Section 6.5.7.3.1, and RUC Settlement for the entire block of RUC-committed hours.  A QSE that has a Resource that meets these conditions must make the Resource available to SCED for the entire block of RUC-committed hours.  ERCOT will send the QSE a notification stating the Operating Day and block of hours for which this occurred.
5.5.3	Communication of RUC Commitments and Decommitments
(1)	The output of the RUC process is the cleared Resource commitments and decommitments, and a list of the Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less.
(2)	ERCOT shall notify each QSE in the Day-Ahead of the DRUC Resource commitments and advisory decommitments that have been cleared by the RUC for the Resources that QSE represents.  ERCOT shall notify each QSE of the HRUC Resource commitments and decommitments that have been cleared by the RUC for the Resources that QSE represents.  Resource commitments must include the start interval and duration for which the Resource is required to be at least at LSL.  Resource decommitments must include the interval in which the Resource is required to be Off-Line, duration, and reason for the decommitment.  ERCOT shall notify each QSE representing an RMR Unit if that unit has been cleared by the DRUC or HRUC process at the same time that the DRUC and HRUC participants are notified of the results of each such process.  
(3)	If ERCOT communicates HRUC commitments and decommitments verbally to a QSE, then the same Resource attributes communicated programmatically must be communicated when ERCOT gives a verbal Resource commitment or decommitment.
(4)	The QSE shall acknowledge the notice or commitment or decommitment by changing the Resource Status of the affected Resources in the COP for RUC-Committed Intervals.
5.6	RUC Cost Eligibility
5.6.1	Verifiable Costs
(1)	The Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) is responsible for submitting verifiable costs unless both the QSE and Resource Entity agree that the Resource Entity will have this responsibility, in which case both the QSE and Resource Entity shall submit an affidavit to ERCOT stating this arrangement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, QSEs that submit Power Purchase or Tolling Agreements (PPAs) do not have the option of allowing Resource Entities to file verifiable costs.
(2)	Make-Whole Payments for a Resource are based on the Startup Offers and Minimum-Energy Offers for the Resource, limited by caps.  Until ERCOT approves verifiable unit-specific costs for that Resource, the caps are the Resource Category Startup Generic Cap and the Resource Category Minimum-Energy Generic Cap.  When ERCOT approves verifiable unit-specific costs for that Resource the caps are those verifiable unit-specific costs.  A QSE or Resource Entity may file verifiable unit-specific costs for a Resource at any time, but it must file those costs no later than 30 days after five Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) events for that Resource in a calendar year.  A RUC event begins when a Resource receives a RUC instruction to come or stay On-Line and ends the later of when the Resource shuts down or the end of the Operating Day.  The most recent ERCOT-approved verifiable costs must be used going forward. 
(3)	These unit-specific verifiable costs may include and are limited to the following average incremental costs:
(a)	Allocation of maintenance requirements based on number of starts between maintenance events using, at the option of the QSE or Resource Entity, either:
(i)	Manufacturer-recommended maintenance schedule; 
(ii)	Historical data for the unit and actual maintenance practices; or
(iii)	Another method approved in advance by ERCOT in writing;
(b)	Startup fuel calculations based on recorded actual measured flows when the data is available or based on averages of historical flows for similar starts (for example, hot, cold, intermediate) when actual data is not available.  Startup fuel will include filing separately the startup fuel required to reach breaker close and fuel after breaker close to Low Sustained Limit (LSL).  Any fuel required to shutdown a Resource will be submitted as the fuel from breaker open to shutdown;
(c)	Operation costs;
(d)	Chemical costs;
(e)	Water costs; and
(f)	Emission credits.
(4)	Standard Operations and Maintenance (O&M) costs pursuant to paragraph (6) below may be used in lieu of the incremental O&M costs set forth in items (3)(a), (c), (d) and (e) above. 
(5)	These unit-specific verifiable costs may not include:
(a)	Fixed costs, which are any cost that is incurred regardless of whether the unit is deployed or not; and
(b)	Costs for which the QSE or Resource Entity cannot provide sufficient documentation for ERCOT to verify the costs.
(6)	At their election, QSEs or Resource Entities may receive standard O&M costs for both startup and minimum energy.  This election may be made by submitting an election form to ERCOT.  If a QSE or Resource has received final approval for actual verifiable O&M costs under the verifiable cost process, it may not elect to receive standard O&M costs.  
(a)	Until December 31, 2011, standard O&M costs are defined as follows:

Renewable	Not Applicable	Not Applicable	Not Applicable	4.40
(d)	If the QSE or Resource Entity chooses to utilize the standard O&M costs for O&M, standard O&M costs will be used by ERCOT going forward until either:
(i)	Verifiable variable O&M costs are filed; or 
(ii)	ERCOT notifies the QSE or Resource Entity to update its verifiable costs as set forth in either paragraph (9) or (10) below.  If a Resource is receiving standard O&M costs, it may reelect standard O&M costs when resubmitting verifiable costs.
(7)	When submitting verifiable costs for combined cycle Resources, the QSE or Resource Entity must elect standard O&M costs for all Combined-Cycle Configurations or verifiable costs for all Combined-Cycle Configurations within the combined cycle train.  
(8)	QSEs submitting PPAs as Resource-specific verifiable costs documentation are subject to the guidelines detailed below and in the Verifiable Cost Manual.
(a)	Only QSEs offering Three-Part Supply Offers for a specific Resource may submit a PPA as verifiable costs documentation.
(b)	A QSE submitting a PPA as verifiable costs documentation must represent 100% of the Resource’s capacity.  
(c)	Only PPAs:  
(i) 	Signed prior to July 16, 2008; and 
(ii)	Not between Affiliates, subsidiaries or partners will be accepted as verifiable cost documentation.
(d)	Verifiable costs for PPAs shall be capped at the level of the highest comparable Resource (referred to as the reference Resource) specific verifiable costs approved by ERCOT without a PPA.  The ERCOT approved verifiable costs for a PPA shall be equal to the lesser of:  
(i)	The cap as described in paragraph (d) above; and 
(ii)	The costs from the PPA.
(e)	ERCOT shall use the Resource actual fuel costs submitted by the QSE for startup and operation at minimum-energy level (LSL), and shall use the Resource Category Startup Offer Generic Costs as the cap for the O&M portion of the Startup Costs until ERCOT receives and approves comparable Resource specific verifiable costs.  
(f)	PPAs will no longer be accepted as verifiable cost documentation after the primary term of the contract expires. 
(g)	ERCOT shall produce a report each April that provides the percentage of RUC Make-Whole Payments for Resources with PPAs during the 12 months of the previous calendar year.  If there are no Make-Whole Payments for Resources with PPAs, ERCOT shall not produce the annual report.  The report shall be based on the final Settlements and include the total number of Resources that used a PPA for their most recent verifiable cost submission that was approved by ERCOT.  ERCOT shall present the results of this study to the appropriate Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) subcommittee.
(h)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.6.1, QSEs representing PPAs may, at any time, submit data from a Resource as verifiable costs documentation and such documentation will be accepted for consideration by ERCOT.  A QSE submitting verifiable costs documentation pursuant to this paragraph shall not be required to submit a PPA to ERCOT for consideration for verifiable cost recovery.
(9)	ERCOT shall notify a QSE to update verifiable cost data of a Resource when the Resource has received more than 50 RUC instructions meeting the criteria in Section 5.6.2, RUC Startup Cost Eligibility, in a year, but ERCOT may not request an update more frequently than annually. 
(10)	ERCOT shall notify a QSE to update verifiable cost data of a Resource if at least five years have passed since ERCOT previously approved verifiable cost data for that Resource. 
(11)	Within 30 days after receiving an update Notice from ERCOT under either paragraph (9) or (10) above, a QSE or Resource Entity must submit verifiable cost data for the Resource.  Despite the provisions in paragraph (2) above, if the QSE or Resource Entity does not submit verifiable cost data within 30 days after receiving an update Notice, then ERCOT shall determine payment using the Resource Category Startup Offer Generic Cap, Resource Category Minimum-Energy Offer Generic Cap, and a zeroed value for variable O&M cost as described in Section 4.4.9.4.1, Mitigated Offer Cap, in accordance with the schedule established in this section until updated verifiable costs are approved.  If the 30-day deadline has been reached before the start of the tenth day before the end of the month, the Resource’s verifiable costs will revert back to generic costs beginning on the first day of the following month.  If the 30-day deadline falls within the last ten days of the month, the Resource’s verifiable costs will revert back to generic costs on the first day of the second month following the deadline month.
(12) 	Notwithstanding the foregoing, QSEs and Resource Entities shall not submit verifiable costs for Energy Storage Resources (ESRs).
5.6.1.1	Verifiable Startup Costs
(1)	The unit-specific verifiable costs for starting a Resource for each cold, intermediate, and hot start condition, as determined using the data submitted under Section 5.6.1, Verifiable Costs, and the Resource Parameters for the Resource are: 
(a) 	Actual fuel consumption rate per start (MMBtu/start) multiplied by a resource fuel price plus consideration of a fuel adder that compensates for the transportation and purchasing of spot fuel as described in the Verifiable Cost Manual; and
(b) 	Unit-specific verifiable or standard O&M expenses.
5.6.1.2	Verifiable Minimum-Energy Costs 
(1)	The unit-specific verifiable minimum-energy costs for a Resource are: 
(a)	Actual fuel cost to operate the unit at its LSL including a fuel adder that compensates for the transportation and purchasing of spot fuel as described in the Verifiable Cost Manual; plus
(b)	Verifiable or standard variable O&M expenses.
(2)	The QSE must submit the Resource’s cost information by Season if the Resource’s costs vary by Season.  For gas-fired units, the actual fuel costs must be calculated using the actual Seasonal heat rate (which must be supplied to ERCOT with Seasonal heat-rate test data) multiplied by the fuel price plus consideration of a fuel adder that compensates for the transportation and purchasing of spot fuel as described in the Verifiable Cost Manual.  For coal- and lignite-fired units, the actual fuel costs must be calculated using the actual Seasonal heat rate multiplied by a deemed fuel price of $1.50 per MMBtu.  For fuel oil-fired operations, the number of gallons burned must be multiplied by the FOP.
5.6.2	RUC Startup Cost Eligibility
(1)	For purposes of this Section 5.6.2, all contiguous RUC-Committed Hours are considered as one RUC instruction.  For each Resource, only one Startup Cost is eligible per block of contiguous RUC-Committed Hours.
(2)	For a Resource’s Startup Costs in the Operating Day, per RUC instruction, to be included in the calculation of the RUC guarantee for that Operating Day, all the criteria below must be met: 
(a)	According to the Current Operating Plan (COP) and Trades Snapshot for the RUC process that committed the Resource, the Resource must not be QSE-committed in the Settlement Interval immediately before the designated start hour or after the last hour of the RUC instruction;
[NPRR1009:  Replace paragraph (a) above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]
(a)	According to the RUC Snapshot for the RUC process that committed the Resource, the Resource must not be QSE-committed in the Settlement Interval immediately before the designated start hour or after the last hour of the RUC instruction;
(b)	A later RUC instruction or QSE commitment must not connect the designated start hour or last hour of the RUC instruction to a block of QSE-committed Intervals that was QSE-committed before the RUC instruction was given, according to the COP and Trades Snapshot for the RUC process that committed the Resource;
[NPRR1009:  Replace paragraph (b) above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]
(b)	A later RUC instruction or QSE commitment must not connect the designated start hour or last hour of the RUC instruction to a block of QSE-committed Intervals that was QSE-committed before the RUC instruction was given, according to the RUC Snapshot for the RUC process that committed the Resource;
(c)	The generation breakers must have been open, as indicated by a telemetered Resource Status of Off-Line, for at least five minutes during the six hours preceding the first RUC-Committed Hour; and
(d)	The generation breakers must have been closed, as indicated by a telemetered Resource Status of On-Line, for at least one minute during the RUC commitment period or after the determined five-minute open breaker, as indicated by a telemetered Resource Status of Off-Line, in the six hours preceding the first RUC-Committed Hour.
(3)	Notwithstanding paragraphs (2)(c) and (2)(d) above, the QSE of a RUC-committed Resource may submit a Settlement dispute for a Resource’s Startup Costs in the Operating Day, per RUC instruction, to be included in the calculation of the RUC guarantee for that Operating Day if the startup time for the RUC-committed Resource is greater than six hours.  The dispute is subject to verification and approval by ERCOT based on the criteria below:
(a)	The generation breakers must have been open, as indicated by a telemetered Resource Status of Off-Line, for at least five minutes between the time the QSE is notified of the RUC instruction and the first RUC-Committed Hour;
(b)	The generation breakers must have been closed, as indicated by a telemetered Resource Status of On-Line, for at least one minute during the RUC commitment period or after the five-minute open breaker determined in item (a) above;
(c)	The breaker open-close sequence from items (a) and (b) above does not make the Resource eligible for Startup Cost compensation in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) or for any other contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours; and
(d)	The startup time used to process the dispute will be the startup time considered by the ERCOT Operator at the time the RUC instruction was issued.
(4)	For purposes of this Section 5.6.2, the telemetered Resource Status of OFFQS shall be considered as Off-Line.
(5)	A Resource that has a Three-Part Supply Offer cleared in the DAM and subsequently receives a RUC commitment for the Operating Hour for which it was awarded will be settled in accordance with Section 4.6.2.3, Day-Ahead Make-Whole Settlements.
5.6.3	Forced Outage of a RUC-Committed Resource
(1)	The calculation of a Make-Whole Payment for a RUC-committed Resource that is eligible to receive startup costs under Section 5.6.2, RUC Startup Cost Eligibility, and that experiences a Forced Outage after unit synchronization is governed by Section 5.6.2.
(2)	If a RUC-committed Resource, which Resource is eligible to include startup costs in its RUC guarantee under Section 5.6.2 without considering the criteria in item (2)(d) of Section 5.6.2, experiences startup failure that creates a Forced Outage before breaker close, ERCOT shall include the Resource’s submitted and approved verifiable actual costs in the Resource’s RUC guarantee, limited to the lesser of: 
(a)	Costs that qualify as normal startup expenses, including fuel and operation and maintenance expenses, incurred before the event that caused the Forced Outage; or
(b)	Resource’s Startup Offer in the RUC. 
(3)	The process for determining the verifiable actual costs for a startup attempt under item (2) above is described in the Verifiable Cost Manual. 
(4)	The verifiable actual costs for a startup attempt under item (2) above shall only be included in the Resource’s RUC guarantee upon QSE notification of the startup attempt under item (2) and approval of the verifiable actual costs under item (3) above.
5.6.4	Cancellation of a RUC Commitment
(1)	The calculation of payment for a RUC-committed Resource that is issued a RUC Cancellation instruction for the RUC commitment from ERCOT prior to breaker close shall be paid through the RUC Decommitment Payment as described in Section 5.7.3, Payment When ERCOT Decommits a QSE-Committed Resource. 
(2)	A RUC-committed Resource that receives a RUC Cancellation instruction prior to breaker close may submit through the dispute process all incremental expenses associated with the RUC Cancellation of the RUC-committed Resource.  These costs include all costs that qualify as normal Startup Costs, O&M expenses and associated fuel expenses incurred for any attempted start.
(3)	The process for determining the verifiable actual costs for a RUC cancellation is described in the Verifiable Cost Manual.
5.6.5	Settlement for Canceled or Delayed Outages for Outage Schedule Adjustments (OSAs)
5.6.5.1	Make-Whole Payment for Canceled or Delayed Outages for OSAs
(1) 	If ERCOT issues an Outage Schedule Adjustment (OSA) pursuant to Section 3.1.4.6, Outage Coordination of Potential Transmission Emergency Conditions, or Section 3.1.6.9, Withdrawal of Approval and Rescheduling of Approved Planned Outages of Resource Facilities, ERCOT shall pay the QSE representing the Resource a Make-Whole Payment as calculated in Section 5.6.5.2, RUC Make-Whole Payment and RUC Clawback Charge for Resources Receiving OSAs, if the QSE has:
(a)	Submitted a Settlement and billing dispute consistent with the dispute process described in Section 9.14, Settlement and Billing Dispute Process; and 
(b)	Submitted the following within 60 days of the issuance of a Real-Time Market (RTM) Initial Statement for an Operating Day on which one or more OSAs was in effect for the Resource: 
(i)	An attestation signed by an officer or executive with authority to bind the QSE stating that the information contained in the submission is accurate;
(ii)	The dollar amount and calculation of the net financial loss, if applicable, by Settlement Interval for:
(A)	Actual and indirect costs incurred due to delaying or canceling and rescheduling the Outage.  Such costs include, but are not limited to: 
(1)	Additional staff or contractor time;
(2)	Costs associated with re-planning the Outage;
(3)	Costs of equipment rental (including but not limited to cranes, manlifts, welding machines, etc.);
(4)	Costs of facility rentals and other incidental incremental costs incurred by the Resource, its QSE, or its fuel supplier (e.g. mine-related expenses) created by the cancellation or delay of the Outage; and
(5)	Indirect costs necessary for moving any additional Outages due to the OSA.
(B)	Costs covered by paragraph (A) above do not include:
(1)	The cost of materials due to be installed during the Outage.  Such equipment will presumably be installed at a later date in a rescheduled or delayed Outage; and 
(2) 	All loss amounts associated with the Outage Resource as a result of any financial transaction, including selling or repurchasing a hedge (whether the hedge is for energy, Ancillary Services, or fuel); and
(iii)	Sufficient documentation to support the QSE’s calculation of all submitted costs.
5.6.5.2	RUC Make-Whole Payment and RUC Clawback Charge for Resources Receiving OSAs
(1)	To compensate QSEs representing Resources that submitted a timely Settlement and billing dispute, ERCOT shall calculate a RUC Guarantee for an Operating Day for the OSA Period to be used in the RUC Settlements process and allocated to each instructed Operating Hour as follows:
(a)	For a Resource with RUC instructions issued for hours during the OSA Period, the RUC Guarantee calculated for the RUC-Committed Hours shall include the following: 	
(i)	Eligible Startup costs per Section 5.6.2, RUC Startup Cost Eligibility;
(ii)	Minimum-energy costs;
(iii)	10% of both Startup costs and minimum-energy costs; and
(iv)	Approved net financial loss as defined in Section 5.6.5.1, Make-Whole Payment for Canceled or Delayed Outages for OSAs.
(b)	For a Resource without RUC Instructions issued for hours during the OSA Period, ERCOT shall create RUC instructions for all hours of the OSA Period for Settlement purposes only.  The created RUC instructions will be assigned to the first RUC process of each Operating Day.  The RUC Guarantee shall include only the following:
(i)	Approved net financial loss as defined in Section 5.6.5.1.
(c)	For a Resource that rescheduled an Outage within 120 days of the end of the OSA Period under paragraph (4) of Section 3.1.6.9, Withdrawal of Approval and Rescheduling of Approved Planned Outages of Resource Facilities, the RUC Guarantee determined in paragraphs (a) and (b) above must include an OSA Make-Whole Cost (OSAMW), calculated for the same corresponding OSA Period hours, when the Outage is rescheduled due to the OSA, starting with the first day of the rescheduled Outage period.  The OSAMW calculated for the rescheduled Outage hours shall be allocated to the corresponding RUC instructed hours, in paragraphs (a) or (b) above, on a day-by-day basis.  The OSAMW shall be calculated as follows:
OSAMW q, r, d   =  (Max (0, (RTSPP – MOC q, r, h)) * HSL q, r, h * (¼))
The above variables are defined as follows:
Variable	Unit	Definition
OSAMW q, r, d   	$	OSA Make-Whole Cost—The OSA Make-Whole cost for Resource r represented by QSE q during the eligible rescheduled Outage Hours, for the Operating Day d.  When one or more Combined Cycle Generation Resources receive an OSA, the Make-Whole cost is calculated for the Combined Cycle Train for the OSA Period.
RTSPP	$/MWh	Real-Time Settlement Point Price—The Real-Time Settlement Point Price at the Settlement Point for the 15-minute Settlement Interval of an eligible rescheduled Outage Hour.
MOC q, r, h	$/MWh	Mitigated Offer Cap per Resource—The MOC for Resource r represented by QSE q, for the eligible rescheduled Outage hour h at the High Sustained Limit (HSL) as submitted in the COP. Where for a Combined Cycle Train, the Resource r is a Combined Cycle Generation Resource within the Combined Cycle Train.
HSL q, r, i	MW	High Sustained Limit—The HSL of a Generation Resource r represented by QSE q as submitted in the COP, for the hour that includes the Settlement Interval i.  Where for a combined cycle Resource, r is a Combined Cycle Generation Resource.
q	none	A QSE.
r	none	A Generation Resource.
d	none	The Operating Day.
h	none	The Operating Hour. 
i	none	A 15-minute Settlement Interval within the hour.
(2) 	Notwithstanding the clawback provisions described in Section 5.7.2, RUC Clawback Charge, the clawback percentage shall be set at 100%.
5.6.5.3	Timeline for Calculating RUC Clawback Charges for Resources Receiving OSAs
(1)	Within ten Business Days after the issuance of the RTM True-Up Statement, ERCOT will issue a Miscellaneous Invoice to charge the QSE representing the Resource that has received an OSA the excess revenues not clawed back in RUC Settlements.
(2)	All clawed back revenues will be paid to QSEs based on a 15-minute Load-Ratio Share basis.
5.7	Settlement for RUC Process
5.7.1	RUC Make-Whole Payment
(1)	To make up the difference when the revenues that a Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC)-committed Resource receives are less than its costs as described in paragraph (2) below, ERCOT shall calculate a RUC Make-Whole Payment for that Operating Day for that Resource (whether committed by Day-Ahead RUC (DRUC) or Hourly RUC (HRUC)).
[NPRR1014:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation:]

5.7.1.1	RUC Guarantee
(1)	The allowable Startup Costs and minimum-energy costs of a Resource committed by RUC is the RUC Guarantee.  The RUC Guarantee minimum-energy costs are prorated according to the actual generation when the Resource’s average output during a 15-minute Settlement Interval is below the corresponding LSL.
(2)	The SUPR, MEPR and LSL used to calculate the RUC Guarantee for a Combined Cycle Train are the SUPR, MEPR and LSL that correspond to the Combined Cycle Generation Resource, within the Combined Cycle Train, that is RUC-committed for the hour.  If the RUC-Committed Interval is a RUC for Additional Capacity (RUCAC)-Interval, then the SUPR, MEPR, and LSL that corresponds to the QSE-committed Combined Cycle Generation Resource is also used to calculate RUC Guarantee for a Combined Cycle Train.
(3)	For an Aggregate Generation Resource (AGR), the Startup Cost shall be scaled according to the maximum number of its generators online during a contiguous block of RUC-committed intervals, as indicated by telemetry, compared to the total number of generators registered to the AGR and used in the approved verifiable cost for the AGR.
(4)	The RUC Guarantee is calculated for non-Combined Cycle Trains as follows: 
RUCG q, r, d	=	  (SUPR q, r, s * RUCSUFLAG q, r, s) +  (MEPR q, r, i * Min ((LSL q, r, i * (¼)), RTMG q, r, i))
(5)	The RUC Guarantee is calculated for Combined Cycle Trains as follows:
RUCG q, r, d	=	(SUPR q, r, s * RUCSUFLAG q, r, s) + 
		 (MAX (0, SUPR - SUPR)) +  (RUCGME q, r, i)
Where,
	If a Combined Cycle Train transitions to a RUC-committed configuration from a QSE-committed or other RUC-committed configuration between two contiguous hours, or to a RUC-committed configuration from a QSE-committed configuration within the same hour due to a RUCAC, the transition is calculated as follows:
MAX (0, SUPR afterCCGR – SUPR beforeCCGR)
	If a Combined Cycle Train transitions to a QSE-committed configuration from a RUC-committed configuration, the transition is calculated as follows:
MAX (0, SUPR beforeCCGR – SUPR afterCCGR)
If the interval i is a RUC-Committed Interval that is not a RUCAC, then:
RUCGME q, r, i	=  MEPR q, r, i * Min ((LSL q, r, i * (¼)), RTMG q, r, i)
If the interval i is a RUCAC of a previously QSE-Committed Interval, then:
RUCGME q, r, i	=  Max [0, MEPR q, afterCCGR, i * Min ((LSL q, afterCCGR, i * 
		(¼)), RTMG q, r, i) – MEPR q, beforeCCGR, i * (LSL q, beforeCCGR, i * (¼))]
(6)	If a validated Three-Part Supply Offer has been submitted for a Resource for the RUC, then the RUC Guarantee for that Resource is based on the minimum of the Startup Offer in that validated Three-Part Supply Offer and Startup Cap and the lesser of the Minimum-Energy Offer in that validated Three-Part Supply Offer and the Minimum-Energy Offer Cap.  If a validated Three-Part Supply Offer has not been submitted for a Resource for the RUC and ERCOT has not yet approved verifiable unit-specific costs for the Resource, then the RUC Guarantee for a Resource is based on the Resource Category Startup Generic Cap and the Resource Category Minimum-Energy Generic Cap.  If a validated Three-Part Supply Offer has not been submitted for a Resource for the RUC and ERCOT has approved verifiable unit-specific costs for the Resource, then the RUC Guarantee for a Resource is based on the most recent ERCOT-approved verifiable unit-specific costs for that Resource.
For a Resource which is not an AGR, 
If the QSE submitted a validated Three-Part Supply Offer, 
	Then, 		SUPR q, r, s	=	Min (SUO q, r, s, SUCAP q, r, s)
			MEPR q, r, i	=	Min (MEO q, r, i, MECAP q, r, i)
	Otherwise, 	SUPR q, r, s 	= 	SUCAP q, r, s
			MEPR q, r, i 	= 	MECAP q, r, i
If ERCOT has approved verifiable Startup Costs and minimum-energy costs for the Resource,
	Then, 		SUCAP q, r, s	=	verifiable Startup Costs q, r, s
			MECAP q, r, i	=	verifiable minimum-energy costs q, r, i
	Otherwise, 	SUCAP q, r, s 	= 	RCGSC s
			MECAP q, r, i	= 	RCGMEC i
For AGRs,
If the QSE submitted a validated Three-Part Supply Offer, 
Then, 		SUPR  q, r, s	=	Min (SUO q, r, s, SUCAP q, r, s)
			MEPR q, r, i	=	Min (MEO q, r, i, MECAP q, r, i)
	Otherwise, 	SUPR q, r, s 	= 	SUCAP q, r, s
			MEPR q, r, i 	= 	MECAP q, r, i
If ERCOT has approved verifiable Startup Costs and minimum-energy costs for the Resource,
	Then, 		SUCAP q, r, s	=	Max c (AGRRATIO q, p, r) * verifiable Startup Costs q, r, s
			MECAP q, r, i	=	verifiable minimum-energy costs q, r, i
	Where, 		AGRRATIO q, p, r	 =	AGRMAXON q, p, r / AGRTOT q, p, r
	Otherwise, 	SUCAP q, r, s 	= 	Max c (AGRRATIO q, p, r) * RCGSC s
