5.4	Planning Data Dictionary
The Planning Data Dictionary is used by ERCOT to show correlation between SSWG Case bus numbers and TSP area SCADA names.  Additionally, the Planning Data Dictionary without the SCADA names is included as part of ERCOT’s FERC 715 filing.  

The exchange of information for the Planning Data Dictionary will only be communicated using an Excel spreadsheet with the columns as listed in the table below.  The table identifies the columns which the TSPs and ERCOT are responsible for populating.  ERCOT does not create or manually update the information submitted by the TSPs.  The Planning Data Dictionary will be updated with each SSWG Case build.

The format will be as follows (see next page):
 
Column Name	TSP Responsibility	ERCOT Responsibility	Description
TSP				Shortened version of SSWG Area
SSWG BUS NUMBER				Extracted from the SSWG Steady State Cases
SSWG BUS DATE IN				From the SSWG Steady State Cases, this is populated by searching for the earliest SSWG Steady State Case that the bus exists.  If the bus exists throughout all of the existing Steady State Cases, the field is left blank under the assumption that it already exists in the NMMS.
SSWG BUS DATE OUT			From the SSWG Steady State Cases, this is populated by searching for the latest SSWG Steady State Case that the bus exists.  If the bus exists throughout all of the existing SSWG Steady State Cases, the field is left blank under the assumption that it exists beyond the current planning scope.
SSWG BUS NAME			This is required by FERC for FERC 715 pt. 2 report and is extracted from the SSWG Steady State Cases.  
SSWG BASE KV			This is required by FERC for FERC 715 pt. 2 report and is extracted from the SSWG Steady State Cases
SSWG BUS TYPE			Extracted from the SSWG Steady State Cases
SSWG AREA			Extracted from the SSWG Steady State Cases
NMMS BUS NUMBER			Extracted from NMMS
NMMS BUS NAME			Extracted from NMMS
NMMS STATION CODE			Extracted from NMMS
NMMS STATION NAME			Extracted from NMMS
NMMS BASE KV			Extracted from NMMS
NMMS TSP				Extracted from NMMS
NMMS WEATHER ZONE				Extracted from NMMS.  Field is populated via mapping sheet for future buses and are italicized.
NMMS SETTLEMENT ZONE			Extracted from NMMS.  Field is populated via mapping sheet for future buses and are italicized.
EIA CODE			EIA Codes for bus within Stations associated with a generating unit.  This is required for the FERC 715 pt. 2 report.
PLANNING BUS LONG NAME				The Planning Bus Long Name is provided by the TSP
(“Substation Name or Switchyard Name’)
PLANNING BUS COUNTY				The Planning Bus County is provided by the TSP
TSP COMMENTS				Section for TSP to provide comments on individual buses.
ERCOT COMMENTS			Information for changes of bus properties throughout all SSWG Steady State Cases.  This information will point to changes in SSWG BUS NAME, SSWG BASE KV and SSWG BUS TYPE.
