Methodology for Dispatching Mothballed Units
In order to minimize the effect on transmission plans of the decision to use mothballed units to meet the load requirement, the generation that is needed from mothballed units as a group will be allocated over all the mothballed units on a capacity ratio share basis.  If this technique results in some of the mothballed units being dispatched at a level below their minimum load, an economic ranking will be used to remove the least economic units from consideration for that particular case so that the allocation of the load requirement among the remaining mothba
