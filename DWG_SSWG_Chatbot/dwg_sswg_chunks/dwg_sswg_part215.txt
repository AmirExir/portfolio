The following performance criteria apply:
	Immediately following the disconnection of voltage source, both AGS-ESRs output should be well controlled and exhibit stable response.  

	System frequency and voltage should settle to a stable operating point (within 5 seconds) and be completely damped within 10 seconds.

	Active and reactive power from each plant should move immediately to meet the load requirement, while response time to 90% of initial change should occur within one cycle.

	Active and reactive power from each plant should settle according to its droop setting.

 
3.1.6 Unit Model Validation
PSCAD models must be accompanied with results from the unit model validation tests performed by the Interconnecting Entity or Resource Entity as required in paragraph (5)(d) of Planning Guide Section 6.2.  These validations shall demonstrate the accuracy of the PSCAD models against actual inverter testing and should be performed for all inverter-based device types with
