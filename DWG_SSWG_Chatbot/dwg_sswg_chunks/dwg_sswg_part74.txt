DUMi	Bus numbers, or extended bus name enclosed in single quotes, of the “dummy buses” connected by the branches that comprise this multi-section line grouping. No defaults allowed.

Up to 10 line sections (and 9 dummy buses) may be defined in each multi-section line grouping.  A branch may be a line section of at most one multi-section line grouping.

Each dummy bus must have exactly two branches connected to it, both of which must be members of the same multi-section line grouping.

The status of line sections and type codes of dummy buses are set such that the multi-section line is treated as a single element.

For our example, the following would be entered as multi-section line data records:
4001, 4742, &1, 4099, 4672
4001, 4742, &2, 4100, 4671
Multi-section lines give a great amount of flexibility in performing contingency studies on SSWG Cases.  When set up correctly, where automatic low-sid
