mulation software, the PSCAD model(s) should be connected to a controllable voltage source whose voltage and frequency can be adjusted for testing. The inverter should be dispatched at full real power unless the test requires otherwise.  Energy storage devices should be tested under both charging and discharging modes.  Simulations should be run for a minimum of 10 seconds.

3.1.6.2 Inverter Hardware Testbench Setup

The testbench should utilize actual inverter hardware programmed with typical default settings.  Thus the test should be representative for all inverter devices under the same hardware and control implementation.
 

3.1.6.3 Testing

The tests are designed to measure the inverter and model response to small and large magnitude disturbances of frequency and voltage as well as the subsynchronous response to gauge model accuracy.  Many of the tests closely parallel those used in the Model Quality Guideline Section 3.1.5.  Alternative testing methods may be permissible if the o
