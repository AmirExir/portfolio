examples).  The spacing between each disturbance may be greater than 10 seconds to allow for recovery as necessary.  
Each voltage disturbance profile starts at 1.0 pu voltage.  The “legacy” curve ends at 0.90 pu voltage.  In the case of Resources, tests shall be performed for two initial conditions: with the facility operating at a 0.95 lagging power factor (at the POI) and with the facility operating at 0.95 leading power factor (at the POI) . The model shall exhibit appropriate dynamic reactive response, active current injection, AVR response, and the model shall not exhibit momentary cessation.
Additionally, the maximized LVRT capability as required in NOG 2.9.1.1(8) or NOG 2.9.1.2(8) shall be documented in a format similar to the tables in NOG 2.9.1.1(1) or NOG 2.9.1.2(1).

When testing the “legacy” profile, the following performance criteria apply:
	For the low voltage transient, the model should inject reactive current throughout the voltage recovery period.  At the POI, both P
