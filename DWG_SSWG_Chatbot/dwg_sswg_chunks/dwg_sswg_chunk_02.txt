3	SSWG CASE PROCEDURES AND SCHEDULES
3.1	General
The SSWG and ERCOT create the SSWG Cases annually and update them biannually at fixed intervals throughout each year.  This section describes the creation and update process and schedule to create and update SSWG Cases .
3.2	SSWG Case Definitions and Build Schedules
The SSWG Cases are created by SSWG each year and consist of the following:

•	Eight seasonal cases starting with the SPG cases representing on-peak and off-peak conditions for the four seasons of the next year beyond the year the cases are built.  
•	Six future year cases representing summer on-peak conditions with the first year beginning two years beyond the year the cases are built.  
•	One future year case representing high renewable and minimum load conditions. 
•	One future year case representing minimum load conditions. 
SSWG Case seasons are defined as follows:

SPG		March, April, May
SUM		June, July, August, September
FAL		October, November
WIN		December, January, February

The following table is a guide for case creation.  YR represents the year the case is created.  
SSWG CASE	NOTES	TRANSMISSION IN-SERVICE DATE
(YR+1) SPG1	2	April 1, (YR+1)
(YR+1) SPG2	3	April 1, (YR+1)
(YR+1) SUM1	1	July 1, (YR+1)
(YR+1) SUM2	3	July 1, (YR+1)
(YR+1) FAL1	2	October 1, (YR+1)
(YR+1) FAL2	3	October 1, (YR+1)
(YR+2) WIN1	1	January 1, (YR+2)
(YR+2) WIN2	3	January 1, (YR+2)
(YR+2) SUM1	1	July 1, (YR+2)
(YR+3) SUM1	1	July 1, (YR+3)
(YR+4) MIN	4	January 1, (YR+4)
(YR+4) HRML	5	January 1, (YR+4)
(YR+4) SUM1	1	July 1, (YR+4)
(YR+5) SUM1	1	July 1, (YR+5)
(YR+6) SUM1	1	July 1, (YR+6)
(YR+7) SUM1	1	July 1, (YR+7)


Notes:
1.	Cases to represent the maximum expected load during the season.
2.	Cases to represent maximum expected load during month of transmission in-service date.
3.	Cases to represent lowest load on same day as the corresponding seasonal case (not a minimum case). For example, (YR) FAL2 case represents the lowest load on the same day as the (YR) FAL1 case.
4.	Case to represent the absolute minimum load expected for the year.
5.	Case to represent a high renewable generation dispatch and absolute minimum load expected for the year.
3.2.1	Updates
The SSWG Case updates will be made in the MOD environment by changing an existing PMCR or creating a new PMCR.  It should be recognized that impedance or ratings updates made to the Network Operations Model after the TP case was created will have to be submitted as a ‘NOMCR Pending’ or ‘NOMCR Submitted’ PMCR to maintain consistency with the Network Operations Model.  See Planning Guide Section 6.4 for additional information about the TPIT process.


 
 
3.3	SSWG Case Build Processes
3.3.1	Overview
The SSWG Cases are based upon the ERCOT Network Operations Model.  Network model data from the ERCOT NMMS system is used to create the TP case.  The TP case, or an incremental update to the previously uploaded TP case, is then imported into MOD and becomes the MOD base case.  ERCOT and the TSPs submit Standard PMCRs and
