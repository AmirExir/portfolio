should be coordinated with the Dynamics Working Group, Operations Working Group, Network Data Support Working Group and System Protection Working Group members to assure that it is correct before submitting the cases. This will insure that all of the cases have the most current steady state and dynamics information.  The following items should be provided to these working groups for data coordination:
•	Unit bus number
•	Unit ID
•	Unit maximum and minimum real power capabilities
•	Unit maximum and minimum reactive power capabilities
•	Unit MVA base
•	Resistive and reactive machine impedances
•	Resistive and reactive generator step-up transformer impedances
•	Reactive devices modeled on the Generator side
4.3.2	Load and Generation Balance
Before the generation schedule can be determined, the expected ERCOT load and losses (demand) must be determined. Each MW of demand needs to be accounted for by a MW of generation. 
4.3.3	Generation Dispatch Methodology for Planning Purposes
