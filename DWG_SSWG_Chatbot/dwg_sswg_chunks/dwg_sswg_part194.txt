). An explanation, including a reference to any exempt status per ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide Section 2.9.1, , shall be provided for models which indicate that the unit trips or fails to meet any of the above performance criteria.




When testing the “voltage dip” profile, the following criteria applies:
	Resources not subject to the “preferred” Voltage Ride Through requirements of NOG 2.9.1.1 are only required to ride through the first dip of the below voltage dip profiles.  This first dip is within the “legacy” LVRT requirements of NOG 2.9.1.2.
	During the voltage dips:
	The model shall inject active current for POI voltage dips of 0.5 and higher. 
	Injections of significantly reduced active current for voltage dips 0.5 pu and 0.7 pu should be accompanied by increased reactive current.
	Reactive current injection at the POI shall be observable immediately or very shortly after a non-zero voltage dip is applied.
	After the voltage dips:
	Real power should recover to full output withi
