porting obligations to ensure compliance with NERC reliability standards and/or other requirements.
The following two subsections describe data requirements for two distinct categories of generation facilities:
	Synchronous Generation Facilities:
	The model data shall include, at minimum, a generator model, a governor model, an exciter model, and if applicable, a power system stabilizer model and an excitation limiter model.
	Explicit frequency protection relay models shall be provided for all generators where relays are set to trip the generating unit within the “no trip zone” of NERC Standard PRC-024 Attachment 1. 
	Explicit voltage protection relay models shall be provided for all generators where relays are set to trip the generating unit within the “no trip zone” of NERC Standard PRC-024 Attachment 2.
	 A governor model is not required for the steam turbine(s) of combined cycle plants.
	IBRs, and WGRs:
The RE shall provide the following data as applicable to the generator technolo
