k model, there could be many tie line changes.  Construction timing for future points of interconnection or modified existing points of interconnection can change.  As a result, a tie line may need to be deleted from some cases and added to others (e.g. deleted from spring cases and added to summer cases).  Additionally, a new substation installed in the middle of an existing tie line can redefine the tie lineâ€™s bus numbers, mileages, impedances, ratings, or ownership. 

Tie line models also affect a number of important ERCOT calculations and therefore must accurately reflect real-world conditions.  Missing, redundant, or erroneous tie line models can produce unrealistic indications of stability and/or voltage limits.  Inaccurate impedances, ratings, transformer adjustment data, status information, mileages, or ownership data can all have a profound effect on system studies.  Therefore, it is imperative that neighboring entities exercise care in coordinating tie line data.
