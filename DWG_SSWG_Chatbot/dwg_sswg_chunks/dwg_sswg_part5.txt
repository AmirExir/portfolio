Planning models are bus-branch representations of the transmission system (60 kV and above), which includes buses, branches, impedances, facility ratings, loads, reactive devices, transformers, generators, and DC lines. 
The ROS directs the SSWG as to which cases are to be created via changes to this procedure manual.  Currently, the SSWG builds a set of steady-state base cases on an annual basis, collectively called the SSWG Cases.  The SSWG Cases consist of the following:
•	8 seasonal cases representing on-peak and off-peak conditions for the four seasons of the next year beyond the year the cases are built  
•	6 future year cases representing summer on-peak conditions with the first year beginning two years beyond the year the cases are built.  
•	1 future year case representing high renewable generation ouput and minimum load conditions
•	1 future year case representing minimum load conditions 
The future summer peak case
