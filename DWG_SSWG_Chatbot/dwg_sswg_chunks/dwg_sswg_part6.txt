The future summer peak cases are collectively known as the Annual Planning Models and are subject to the requirements defined in the ERCOT Protocols.  Each set of SSWG Cases are to be built or updated during the biannual update cycle.
Various groups utilize the SSWG Cases for a variety of tasks.   These tasks include, but are not limited to the following:

•	ERCOT and TSPs test the interconnected systems modeled in the cases against the transmission system planning performance requirements set forth by NERC,  ERCOT Planning Guide and their individual TSP planning criteria to assess future system reliability. 

•	ROS Working Groups and ERCOT use the SSWG Cases as the basis for other types of calculations and studies including, but not limited to: 

o	Internal planning studies and generation interconnection studies
o	Voltage control and reactive planning studies
o	Basis for Dynamics Working Group stability studies
