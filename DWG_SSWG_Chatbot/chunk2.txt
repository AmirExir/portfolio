Appendix B
Methodology for Calculating Wind Generation levels in the SSWG Cases

Goal – Use available forecast data to set the dispatch for wind generation in the new SSWG Cases.

Section 3.2.6.2.2 of the Nodal Procotols 

WINDPEAKPCT s, r	%	Seasonal Peak Average Wind Capacity as a Percent of Installed Capacity—The average wind capacity available for the summer and winter Peak Load Seasons s and region r, divided by the installed capacity for region r, expressed as a percentage. The Seasonal Peak Average, derived from Settlement data, is first calculated as the average capacity during the 20 highest system-wide peak Load hours for a given year’s summer and winter Peak Load Seasons. The final value is the average of the previous ten eligible years of Seasonal Peak Average values. Eligible years include 2009 through the most recent year for which COP data is available for the summer and winter Peak Load Seasons.  If the number of eligible years is less than ten, the average shall be based on the number of eligible years available.  This calculation is limited to WGRs that have been in operation as of January 1 for each year of the period used for the calculation.
WINDCAP s, i, r	MW	Existing WGR Capacity—The capacity available for all existing WGRs for the summer and winter Peak Load Seasons s, year i, and region r, multiplied by WINDPEAKPCT for summer and winter Peak Load Seasons s and region r.



 
Appendix C
Mexico’s Transmission System in ERCOT SSWG Cases

This appendix provides an explanation of the modeling that represents Mexico’s Comisión Federal de Electridad (CFE) system in SSWG cases. A drawing of the system is at the end of this appendix.  All AEP and CFE facilities (bus, lines, etc.) tied to the CFE grid will be assigned to area 24 and zone 612.  The AEP facilities will retain the owner 9 and CFE will be assigned owner 300.

The following generation modeled in the power flow and short circuit cases are system equivalents of the CFE system and are located in Mexico. These units are not in ERCOT and should only be used for specialized studies. These units should not be included when performing transfer studies in ERCOT unless one is studying a transfer to or from CFE. The generation capability is not counted in ERCOT reports. These units are online in the cases to offset the real and reactive losses that are caused by the other CFE transmission facilities and reactive flow across the Laredo VFT and Railroad HVDC ties that are modeled in the SSWG cases.  Lines in CFE will not be included in the ERCOT contingency list.

Generation Station Name	Bus Number	Bus Voltage
CIDINDUS-138 (System Equivalent)	86104	138kV
CIDINDUS-230 (Swing Bus/Equivalent)	86105	230kV
CUF-230 (System Equivalent)	86106	230kV
CUF-138 (System Equivalent)	86107	138kV

The following are the transmission lines between Mexico and the United States.  All of the tie lines between CFE and ERCOT are operated normally open with the exception of the asynchronous ties at Laredo and Railroad.

Mexico	United States
Bus Name	Bus Number	Bus Voltage	Bus Name	Bus Number	Bus Voltage
Falcon	86111	138	Falcon	8395	138
Piedras Negras	86110	138	Laredo VFT	80168	230
Ciudad Industrial	86105	230	Laredo VFT	80169	138
Ciudad Industrial	86104	138	Railroad	79604	138
Cumbres	86107	138	Frontera	86114	138
Cumbres	86107	138	Military Highway	8339	138
Matamoras	86112	138	Brownsville Switching Station	8332	69
Matamoras	86113	69			




 
Asynchronous Ties

Laredo

The Variable Frequency Transformer (VFT) in Laredo has a detailed model at busses 80170 (ERCOT Side), 80014 (ERCOT Side), 80169 (CFE Side), and 80165 (CFE Side) with a total transfer capability of 100 MW.  The VFT is tied to the CFE system by a 12.73 mile 230 kV transmission line and a 12.39 mile normally open 138 kV transmission line.  Both lines terminate at the CFE Ciudad Industrial Substation (86103 and 86104) and are breakered at each end.  There is also a normally open 138 kV transmission line between the Laredo Power Plant (8293) and the Laredo VFT (80169) that is utilized for emergency block load transfers between ERCOT and CFE.  The Laredo Power Plant to Laredo VFT 138 kV transmission line is breakered at both ends.

Railroad

The HVDC tie in Mission has a detailed model at busses 79604 (ERCOT Side) and 88254 (CFE Side) with a total transfer capability of 300 MW.  The Railroad HVDC is tied to the CFE system at Cumbres (86107) by an 11.79 mile 138 kV transmission line and is breakered at each end.  There is also a normally open bus tie that by-passes the HVDC that is utilized for emergency block load transfers between ERCOT and CFE.  The by-pass is breakered at both ends.


Normally Open Block Load Ties

Brownsville Switching Station

The Brownsville Switching Station (8332) is connected to the CFE Matamoras Substation (86113) by a 1.9 mile 69 kV transmission line and is breakered at each end.  The transmission line is operated normally open and is utilized for emergency block load transfers between ERCOT and CFE.

Military Highway

The Military Highway Substation (8339) is connected to the CFE Matamoras Substation (86112) by a 1.44 mile 138 kV transmission line and is breakered at each end.  The transmission line is operated normally open and is utilized for emergency block load transfers between ERCOT and CFE.

Frontera

The Frontera Power Plant (86114) is connected to the CFE Cumbres Substation (86107) by a 138 kV transmission line.  This transmission line is privately owned and operated by the owners of the Frontera Power Plant and is utilized to move the generation at Frontera Power Plant between the ERCOT and CFE systems. 

Falcon

The Falcon Substation (8395) is connected to the CFE Falcon Substation (86111) by a .3034 mile 138 kV transmission line and is breakered at each end.  The transmission line is operated normally open and is utilized for emergency block load transfers between ERCOT and CFE. 



Normally Open Block Load Ties on Distribution 
  
There are three normally open ties with CFE that are on the 12.47 kV distribution systems. These ties are at Amistad, Presido and Redford. These ties are only used for emergency block load transfers. Since SSWG does not model radial distribution systems these points are not in the SSWG power flow cases.

Appendix F 
 
Technical Rationale for Less limiting Facilities 
 
ERCOT and TSPs shall model Facility Ratings and System steady-state voltage limits (voltage-based Facility Ratings) that are equally limiting or more limiting than operational Facility Ratings and voltage limits developed in accordance with the ERCOT System Operating Limit (SOL) Methodology for the Operations Time Horizon, as represented in the MOD Base Case. Facility Ratings and voltage limits include, but are not limited to, bus voltage limits, transformer ratings, line ratings, breaker ratings, and switch ratings.

ERCOT or TSPs must provide one of the following technical rationale to model less limiting Facility Ratings or voltage limits in the SSWG Cases:

•	Transmission Project, for planned transmission projects that would modify transmission facilities. This category generally applies to the following PMCR types:
o	Tier 1, 2, 3, & 4
o	No_TPIT
o	Generation Interconnection
•	Data Corrections, for modeling adjustments to correct errors that cannot be corrected in the operational Facility Rating or voltage limit. This category generally applies to the following PMCR type:
o	Standard_PMCR
•	Data Updates, for data quality checks and updates for in-service equipment and to reflect as-built Facilities. This category generally applies to the following PMCR types:
o	NOMCR_Pending
o	NOMCR_Submitted
•	Other, for technical rationale that is not in one of the above categories
