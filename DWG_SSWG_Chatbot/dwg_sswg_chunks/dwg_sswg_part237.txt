city of 5 MW or greater. If the RE is not required to provide a model and/or an adequate model is not available to DWG, a generic model with DWG approved parameters in the ERCOT DWG DG Parameterization Guideline will be used.
SODGs less than 5 MW will be represented as negative load (with GNET) in DWG base cases. 
3.5.3 Unregistered Distributed Generation (UDG)
UDG dynamics will not be explicitly represented in DWG base cases.  DWG will not modify UDG representation from the SSWG  case - UDG will be embedded or reflected in the load according to current TSP conventions.

 
Overview of DWG Activities 
	Updating Dynamic Data and Flat Starts
	Schedule for Dynamic Data Updates and Flat Start Cases
Note: This section addresses requirements stated in R2 of NERC Standards TPL-001-4 and TPL-001-5.1 (effective July 1, 2023).

Each June, the DWG shall prepare a detailed schedule for developing flat start cases and providing associated dynamic contingencies.  The DWG shall begin the flat start ca
