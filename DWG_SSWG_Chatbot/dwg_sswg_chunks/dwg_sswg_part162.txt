ne in the cases to offset the real and reactive losses that are caused by the other CFE transmission facilities and reactive flow across the Laredo VFT and Railroad HVDC ties that are modeled in the SSWG cases.  Lines in CFE will not be included in the ERCOT contingency list.

Generation Station Name	Bus Number	Bus Voltage
CIDINDUS-138 (System Equivalent)	86104	138kV
CIDINDUS-230 (Swing Bus/Equivalent)	86105	230kV
CUF-230 (System Equivalent)	86106	230kV
CUF-138 (System Equivalent)	86107	138kV

The following are the transmission lines between Mexico and the United States.  All of the tie lines between CFE and ERCOT are operated normally open with the exception of the asynchronous ties at Laredo and Railroad.
