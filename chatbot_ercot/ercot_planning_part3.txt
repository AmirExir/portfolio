6.1	Steady-State Model Development	
(1)	To adequately simulate steady-state system conditions, it is necessary to establish and maintain steady-state data and simulation-ready study cases in accordance with the ERCOT Steady State Working Group Procedure Manual.  These case models, known as steady-state base cases, shall contain appropriate equipment characteristics and system data, and shall represent projected system conditions that provide a starting point for each required season and year.  
(a)	The Annual Planning Model base cases, which represent the annual peak load conditions, as prescribed in Protocol Section 3.10.2, Annual Planning Model, shall be developed annually, updated on a biannual basis, and may be updated as needed on an interim basis.  Each Annual Planning Model base case, biannual updates, and off-cycle updates shall be posted on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area to ensure availability of the most accurate steady-state base cases.  
(b)	Additional steady-state base cases, such as seasonal base cases, shall also be developed annually, updated on a biannual basis, and may also be updated as needed on an interim basis.  These derivative base cases, biannual updates, and off-cycle updates shall be posted on MIS Secure Area to ensure availability of the most accurate steady-state base cases.
(c)	Off-cycle updates not associated with the biannual update shall be posted in a timely manner and include:
		(i)	Corrections to significant errors discovered in modeling or major 				changes in operation configuration that affect the steady-state base 				cases; or

At a minimum, the list shall contain all required category P1, P2, P4, P5, and P7 contingencies, as described in the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standard addressing Transmission System Planning Performance Requirements, all contingencies representing the Forced Outage of a double circuit (two circuits on the same structures in excess of 0.5 miles in length), all contingencies representing the Outage of a double circuit (two circuits on the same structure in excess of 0.5 miles in length) where both circuits must be taken out for a maintenance outage, and any other contingencies described in the ERCOT Steady State Working Group Procedure Manual.  
6.11	Process for Developing Geomagnetically-Induced Current (GIC) System Models
(1)	To adequately simulate Geomagnetic Disturbance (GMD) events, it is necessary to establish and maintain Geomagnetically-Induced Current (GIC) system models and conduct geomagnetic disturbance vulnerability assessments to determine whether the ERCOT System can meet the performance requirements of the benchmark and supplemental geomagnetic disturbance event described in North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards.  These GIC system models shall contain appropriate system data, and shall represent projected system conditions that provide a starting point for the required year(s).  
(a)	ERCOT, in collaboration with Transmission Service Providers (TSPs) and Resource Entities, shall develop and maintain the GIC system models.  The GIC system models are derived from the steady-state base cases developed by Steady State Working Group (SSWG) for the near-term transmission planning horizon to ensure consistency between the system topology in the SSWG base cases and GIC system models. 
(b)	ERCOT, in collaboration with TSPs and Resource Entities, may set a Generation Resource to out of service prior to receiving a Notification of Suspension of Operations (NSO) if the Resource Entity notifies ERCOT of its intent to retire/mothball the Generation Resource and/or makes a public statement of its intent to retire/mothball the Generation Resource.
(i)	ERCOT will post and maintain the current list of Generation Resources that will be set to out of service pursuant to paragraph (1)(b) above on the ERCOT website.
[PGRR118:  Replace paragraph (b) above with the following upon system implementation of NPRR1246:]
(b)	ERCOT, in collaboration with TSPs and Resource Entities, may set a Generation Resource or Energy Storage Resource (ESR) to out of service prior to receiving a Notification of Suspension of Operations (NSO) if the Resource Entity notifies ERCOT of its intent to retire/mothball the Resource and/or makes a public statement of its intent to retire/mothball the Resource.
(i)	ERCOT will post and maintain the current list of Generation Resources and ESRs that will be set to out of service pursuant to paragraph (1)(b) above on the ERCOT website.
(c)	Each TSP, or its Designated Agent, shall provide its respective transmission network GIC model data in accordance with the GIC System Model Procedure Manual.
(d)	Each Resource Entity, or its Designated Agent, shall provide its respective Resource Entity-owned generating units, plants, transmission lines, shunt devices, Main Power Transformers (MPTs), and Generator Step-Ups (GSUs) connected to the ERCOT System in accordance with the GIC System Model Procedure Manual and the Resource Registration Glossary. 
(e)	ERCOT shall aggregate the GIC system model data supplied by each TSP and Resource Entity and shall compile the data to form the GIC system models.  Upon completion of compiling the data for the GIC system models, ERCOT and the TSPs shall review and finalize the GIC system models.  Upon completion of the review of the GIC system models, ERCOT shall post these models on the ERCOT Market Information System (MIS) Certified Transmission Service Provider Information page.  
(f)	Guidelines and formats for the GIC system model data and model maintenance can be found in the GIC System Model Procedure Manual.
(g)	GIC data is considered Protected Information pursuant to Protocol Section 1.3, Confidentiality.

(b)	A list of equipment potentially removed from service as a result of protection system operation or misoperation due to harmonics that could result from the supplemental GMD event.
(3)	TSPs and Resource Entities may refer to a Reliability and Operations Subcommittee (ROS)-approved methodology for developing the equipment lists described in paragraph (2) above.  TSPs and Resource Entities are not required to submit the equipment lists described in paragraph (2) above until 30 days after ROS approves a methodology.
6.12	Addition of a Proposed DC Tie to the Planning Models
(1)	For a proposed Direct Current Tie (DC Tie) that will not be owned by a Transmission Service Provider (TSP), ERCOT will include the applicable DC Tie in the base cases created and maintained by the Steady State Working Group (SSWG), System Protection Working Group (SPWG), and the Dynamics Working Group (DWG), and will notify the SSWG, SPWG, and DWG once ERCOT receives: 
(a)	A signed interconnection agreement from the TSP and a written notice from the TSP that the DC Tie developer has provided: 
(i)	A notice to proceed with the construction of the interconnection;
(ii)	The financial security required to fund the interconnection facilities; and
(b)	The data required under paragraph (2) below.  
(2)	ERCOT will provide notice to the DC Tie developer of the specific data ERCOT requires to model the DC Tie after ERCOT receives the information required under paragraph (1)(a) above.    
(a)	ERCOT retains discretion to request any data it deems necessary to model the new DC Tie. 
(b)	The DC Tie developer shall provide the data to ERCOT within 60 days of receiving the notice from ERCOT specifying the data required.
