The TP case, or an incremental update to the previously uploaded TP case, is then imported into MOD and becomes the MOD base case.  ERCOT and the TSPs submit Standard PMCRs and PMCRs into MOD.  Other PMCRs are also submitted into MOD (i.e. ‘NOMCR_PENDING’ and ‘NOMCR_SUBMITTED’ PMCRs) which are aimed at maintaining consistency between NMMS and MOD.  Additionally, ERCOT and the TSPs submit Load, Generation, and Device Control Profiles into MOD.  After being submitted, approved, and accepted, the combination of PMCRs and Profiles are applied to the MOD seed case to create the SSWG Cases.
The primary software tools utilized for these processes are MOD, MOD File Builder and PSS®E. MOD is a web based application maintained by ERCOT.  TSPs and ERCOT use MOD to submit projects and profiles for SSWG Cases.  ERCOT compiles these submitted projects and profiles to build the SSWG Cases.  Case modifications can be accomplished in MOD by either uploading PMCRs in MOD, or by manual entry using the M
