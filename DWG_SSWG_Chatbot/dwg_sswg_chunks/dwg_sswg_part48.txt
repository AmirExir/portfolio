loss is generally not allowed while monitoring Rate 1 (pre-contingency) and Rate 2 (post-contingency) for all transmission lines greater than 60 kV and transformers with the low side greater than 60 kV. 
2.	The SSWG Cases that are economically dispatched with an attempt to prevent Rate 1 overloads for all transmission lines greater than 60 kV and transformers with the low side greater than 60 kV. 
3.	Not Economically Dispatched
4.	The HRML case build process is as follows:
a.	Topology
i.	Use the topology as of January 1, YR+4
b.	Load
i.	Load shall be set at absolute minimum load expected for the year (the same value utilized by the MIN case)
c.	Respect existing N-0 GTC limits
i.	Model and constrain on the GTC interfaces with an N-0 limit that is not 9999
d.	Dispatch the case
i.	Dispatch nuclear units at full capacity, and NOIE and PUN units at the output in the NOIE/PUN dispatch sheet
ii.	Turn DC ties off
iii.	Determine reserve requirements from ancillary services and dispatch conventi
