n for that particular case so that the allocation of the load requirement among the remaining mothballed units will result in all of those units being loaded above their minimum loads.
For example, assume that, in some future year, ERCOT has a projected peak demand of 80,000MW and a total installed resource capacity of 82,000MW, with 3000MW of that installed capacity being units that are mothballed and have not indicated they will return.  For this simple example, assume that the mothballed capacity is 20 generating units of equal 150MW size.  Ignoring losses and spinning reserve requirement, the steady-state case would need to include 1000MW of the 3000MW mothballed capacity in order to match the load.   Thus, each of the 20 mothballed units would be set to an output of 50MW in the steady-state case (assuming their minimum load is less than 50MW).
Consideration of Alternative Dispatch for Studies
While this treatment of mothballed units attempts to generally minimize the effect of the
