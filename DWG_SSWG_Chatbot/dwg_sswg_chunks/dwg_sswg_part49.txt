.	Turn DC ties off
iii.	Determine reserve requirements from ancillary services and dispatch conventional generation on a lowest cost basis at PMIN if needed to meet reserve requirements. 
1.	Use the average of the last January reserves for:
a.	Responsive Reserve Service – Primary Frequency Response – to come from online headroom
b.	Regulation Up – to come from online headroom
c.	Regulation Down – to come from renewables
d.	Non-Spin – to come from online headroom 
iv.	Dispatch additional conventional generation on a lowest cost basis at PMIN to meet the ERCOT critical inertia requirements
1.	The minimum inertia level to meet is 121 GWs
2.	If the requirements are already met by meeting AS reserve – do not dispatch additional conventional units
v.	Calculate the remaining load to be served (MIN load – sum of nuclear/PUN/reserve PGEN)
vi.	Dispatch renewable units
1.	Collect historical hourly wind and solar data of the past 18 months
a.	Monthly report on uncurtailed generation estimate data
