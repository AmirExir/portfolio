n(s) listed in Section 3.1.1 shall be submitted to both ERCOT and the interconnecting TSP.  In addition to the requirements described in the Planning Guide Section 6.2, Dynamics Model Development, providers of dynamic models shall also adhere to the following requirements:
	Each dynamic device requires a model with model parameters that accurately represent the dynamics of the device over the entire range of operating conditions.
	Static switchable devices part of Inverter-Based Resource (IBR ) facilities (such as on-load tap changing transformers (OLTC) and switchable reactive shunts) should include an initialization script or logic to correctly initialize for the POI initial conditions of the power flow case the model is integrated in (for example, a Python file for PSS/e and initialization logic for PSCAD), and should include switching control logic if the device is expected to switch within 45 seconds of a disturbance .
	PSCAD models shall be submitted to ERCOT for all IBRs, Wind-p
