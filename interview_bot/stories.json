Recognizing the inefficiency in the manual workflow, I broke down the contingency process into smaller, repeatable tasks and created a prioritization matrix to rank upgrade options based on cost, system reliability impact, and load-serving potential. I delegated simpler analysis tasks—such as preliminary contingency screening and data validation—to newer engineers, while mentoring a more experienced colleague to take on advanced stability and voltage analysis. This structure allowed parallel work and knowledge sharing within the team.",

Together, we launched experimental projects in three key areas: predictive maintenance using SCADA telemetry data, AI-based load forecasting models using historical demand data, and natural-language retrieval tools for ERCOT documentation. To accelerate this, I personally built a series of AI assistants—custom RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) bots trained on ERCOT Nodal Protocols, Planning Guides, and the Resource Integration Handbook—that allowed engineers to query standards, model validation procedures, and interconnection processes instantly instead of searching lengthy PDFs. I also developed AELAB and load forecasting apps to automate contingency and demand analysis workflows. To strengthen my technical base, I enrolled in the M.S. in Artificial Intelligence program at UT Austin and later encouraged a Corporate Strategy Analyst to join the program, expanding our internal AI capability.",

In the power capacity expansion project, I incorporated future demand forecasts, cost per megawatt, policy constraints, and reliability margins to determine the optimal mix of nuclear and coal generation. In the scheduling problem, I used similar principles to minimize labor costs for nurse shift assignments while maintaining coverage and fairness constraints. Throughout both projects, I 'looked around corners' by anticipating external factors like policy shifts, equipment retirement, and renewable integration, ensuring my models were flexible and forward-compatible.",
