on 100 MVA system base.
4.5.1.3.1	Resistance 
Transformer test records should be used to calculate the resistance associated with a transformer record. Where transformer test records are unavailable, the resistance should be entered as either a value similar to a comparable transformer or zero.
4.5.1.3.2	Reactance
Transformer test records or transformer nameplate impedance should be used to calculate the reactance associated with a transformer record. Where the transformer resistance component is known, the transformer reactance is calculated on the same base using the known data and the reactance component is determined using the Pythagorean Theorem. Where the transformer resistance is assumed to be zero, the calculated transformer reactance can be assumed to be equal to the transformer impedance.
4.5.1.3.3	Susceptance
For power-flow modeling purposes, the transformer susceptance is always assumed to be zero.

 
4.5.1.4	Transformer Ratings
The ratings used for transformer are defined
