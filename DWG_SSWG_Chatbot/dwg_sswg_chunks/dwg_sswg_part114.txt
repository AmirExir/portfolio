d record formats added to a new version of PSSÂ®E.
2.	SSWG determines which, if any, of the new fields or records need to be implemented in NMMS and Topology Processor.
a.	Determine how to use MOD to implement most needed fields immediately
3.	ERCOT determines approximate implementation method, initial impact analysis and cost of implementation for each new field and/or record determined by the SSWG to be necessary for implementation.
a.	Determine method to arbitrate disagreement on proposed recommendation
4.	Present to ROS new fields and/or records that have been jointly determined to be needed, with approximate implementation method, initial impact analysis and cost of implementation.
5.	Upon ROS approval, prepare Project initiation to create and add projects to PPL.
6.	Upon addition to PPL above cut line, prepare requirements documents to describe data type addition/changes to NMMS and Topology Processor output desired for example input.
