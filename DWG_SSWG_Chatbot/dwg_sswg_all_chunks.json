    "text": "The principal function of the SSWG is to provide steady-state power flow models, or base cases, which contain appropriate equipment characteristics, system data, and shall represent projected system conditions.  This procedure manual is intended to demonstrate compliance with NERC Reliability Standards applicable to steady-state modeling. The ERCOT Protocols require the SSWG Cases developed for annual planning purposes to contain, as much as practicable, information consistent with the Network Operations Model.\nPlanning models are bus-branch representations of the transmission system (60 kV and above), which includes buses, branches, impedances, facility ratings, loads, reactive devices, transformers, generators, and DC lines.\nThe ROS directs the SSWG as to which cases are to be created via changes to this procedure manual.  Currently, the SSWG builds a set of steady-state base cases on an annual basis, collectively called the SSWG Cases.  The SSWG Cases consist of the following:\n\u2022\t8 seasonal cases representing on-peak and off-peak conditions for the four seasons of the next year beyond the year the cases are built\n\u2022\t6 future year cases representing summer on-peak conditions with the first year beginning two years beyond the year the cases are built.\n\u2022\t1 future year case representing high renewable generation ouput and minimum load conditions\n\u2022\t1 future year case representing minimum load conditions\nThe future summer peak cases are collectively known as the Annual Planning Models and are subject to the requirements defined in the ERCOT Protocols.  Each set of SSWG Cases are to be built or updated during the biannual update cycle.\nVarious groups utilize the SSWG Cases for a variety of tasks.   These tasks include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n\u2022\tERCOT and TSPs test the interconnected systems modeled in the cases against the transmission system planning performance requirements set forth by NERC,  ERCOT Planning Guide and their individual TSP planning criteria to assess future system reliability.\n\n\u2022\tROS Working Groups and ERCOT use the SSWG Cases as the basis for other types of calculations and studies including, but not limited to:\n\no\tInternal planning studies and generation interconnection studies\no\tVoltage control and reactive planning studies\no\tBasis for Dynamics Working Group stability studies\no\tERCOT transmission loss factor calculation\no\tBasis for ERCOT operating cases and FERC 715 filing"

    "title": "3.3\tSSWG Case Build Processes",
    "text": "3.3.1\tOverview\nThe SSWG Cases are based upon the ERCOT Network Operations Model.  Network model data from the ERCOT NMMS system is used to create the TP case.  The TP case, or an incremental update to the previously uploaded TP case, is then imported into MOD and becomes the MOD base case.  ERCOT and the TSPs submit Standard PMCRs and PMCRs into MOD.  Other PMCRs are also submitted into MOD (i.e. \u2018NOMCR_PENDING\u2019 and \u2018NOMCR_SUBMITTED\u2019 PMCRs) which are aimed at maintaining consistency between NMMS and MOD.  Additionally, ERCOT and the TSPs submit Load, Generation, and Device Control Profiles into MOD.  After being submitted, approved, and accepted, the combination of PMCRs and Profiles are applied to the MOD seed case to create the SSWG Cases.\nThe primary software tools utilized for these processes are MOD, MOD File Builder and PSS\u00aeE. MOD is a web based application maintained by ERCOT.  TSPs and ERCOT use MOD to submit projects and profiles for SSWG Cases.  ERCOT compiles these submitted projects and profiles to build the SSWG Cases.  Case modifications can be accomplished in MOD by either uploading PMCRs in MOD, or by manual entry using the MOD interface.  SSWG members should consult the Planning Model Design Guidelines & Expectations manual for specific instructions on MOD.\n3.3.2\tIncremental Update\nUpon commencement of each new SSWG Case creation and each update, the SSWG implements an incremental update to the MOD base case in order to include the latest Network Operations Model data into the SSWG Cases.  This is accomplished by using MOD File Builder to compare the RAW files of topology processed NMMS data with selected data currently existing in MOD.  MOD File Builder is used to create a comparison PMCR that updates the corresponding Planning Model data in MOD to be consistent with the Network Operations Model data.  The comparison PMCR is subsequently submitted into MOD and committed to the MOD base case to perform the incremental MOD base case update.\nThe sample flowchart below identifies the general process:\n\n\n\n3.3.3\tTransmission In-Service Date for the TP Case\nThe TP case will be generated by ERCOT staff using an NMMS Transmission In-Service Date agreed upon by SSWG. The TP case will contain all existing NOMCRs with a Transmission In-Service Date on or before the agreed upon Transmission In-Service Date. Any NOMCR submitted after the TP case download which happens to have a Transmission In-Service Date prior to the agreed upon Transmission In-Service Date will not be included in the TP case.  For that situation, the TSP who owns the NOMCR must submit a PMCR to appropriately include the network model change in the SSWG Cases.\n3.3.4\tEntity Responsibilities\nThe  SSWG Cases are assembled and produced as a collaborative effort by the SSWG.  The responsibilities for providing this data are divided among the various Market Participants (MPs) and ERCOT. These data provision responsibilities may overlap among the various MPs because MPs may designate their representative or MPs may be a member of more than one MP group.  MPs can generally be divided into four groups: TSPs, LSEs, REs, and Market Entities.  ERCOT staff is included as a fifth entity with data provision responsibilities.  The data responsibilities of each group are as follows:\n3.3.4.1\tTSPs\n\u2022\tIt is the responsibility of each TSP to provide accurate modeling information for all ERCOT Transmission Facilities owned or planned by the TSP.  Submission requirements and naming conventions described in the ERCOT Planning Model Design & Expectations manual shall be followed.\n\u2022\tFuture Transmission Facility changes will be submitted as PMCRs. A PMCR phase date should correspond to the transmission in-service date. PMCRs should be submitted as far out into the future as possible. This technique will make the case building process more efficient when transitioning to new case builds.\n\u2022\tTSPs shall submit Profiles of all load data and associated topology for the load entities of which they are designated representatives, as well as, any other load for which it has accepted responsibility for modeling.\n\u2022\tTSPs shall change the load ID to \u2018ER\u2019 (or \u2018E1\u2019, \u2018E2\u2019, etc.) for loads for which it has historically  submitted data but no longer accepts responsibility.  ERCOT will determine the owner of the load and ensure they are part of the ALDR and SSWG processes. See Appendix E for additional details.\n\u2022\tPUN loads and POI busses will be provided by TSPs.\n\u2022\tNOIEs have the option of submitting a generation dispatch or deferring to ERCOT staff.\n\u2022\tProper transmission system voltages will be maintained by submitting accurate data for static and dynamic reactive resources and transformer settings via a Device Control Profile for each case.  Scheduled bus voltages are maintained by the TSPs and submitted via Device Control Profiles as well.  TSPs can suggest different generator reactive limits Qmax and Qmin for ERCOT to submit in the Load Generation Profiles and should submit data to collaborate the need for the change such as historical unit operation and biennial reactive tests.  ERCOT will submit the change and follow-up with the RE and TSP to determine any Resource Registration Data modifications.\n\u2022\tIf the TSPs identify errors with generator data or RE topology, the TSPs will notify ERCOT staff in accordance with the identified NMMS process.  This process entails email notification to the TSP of a Resource Registration Data change in their footprint and posting of updated Resource Registration Data data on the Citrix NMMS_POSTINGS area of the ERCOT Market Information System.\n\u2022\tReview and resolve all inconsistencies identified from the incremental update process for their respective Transmission Facilities.\n\u2022\tThe \u201cMOD Project\u201d is submitted by the TSPs and the MOD Project ID for the project will become the \u201cTPIT number\u201d.  When editing an accepted project, click the \u201cEdit\u201d button from the project list to put project into \u201cPreliminary\u201d state, then \u201cView\u201d the project from project list and use the \u201cReplace\u201d button to upload edited project.  This will preserve the MOD Project ID for TPIT.\n\u2022\tTSPs are responsible for updating TPIT project and phase information in MOD during each tri-annual case build/update for all the applicable fields as shown below.\n\nField Name\tRequired/ Optional\nERCOT Project Number\tRequired\nRTP Project Number\tRequired if in RTP\nRPG Project Number\tRequired for submitted Tier 1, 2, and 3 projects\nProject Title\tRequired\nProject Description\tOptional\nComments/Reasons for Delays/Cancellations/Speedup\tOptional\nTerminal \"from\" Location\tOptional\nTerminal \"to\" Location\tOptional\nTransmission Status\tOptional\nAssociated Projects (project number)\tOptional\nTransmission Owner\tRequired\nTSP/Company Contact\tRequired\nTransmission Owner Project Number\tOptional\nProjected In-Service Date (Month/Yr)\tRequired\nActual In-Service Date (Month/Yr)\tRequired once energized in the field\nCONFIDENTIAL Total Project Estimated Cost\tRequired\nService Level kV\tRequired\nTrans Circuit Miles New\tOptional\nTrans Circuit Miles Rebuilt or Upgraded\tOptional\nAutotransformer Capacity (MVA)\tOptional\nReactive Capability Added\tOptional\nCounty Location for Substation or for a Line\tOptional\nCounty Location for Ending Point for a Line\tOptional\nPlanning Charter Tier\tRequired\nDate Submitted TO ERCOT for RPG Review\tRequired for submitted Tier 1, 2, and 3 projects\nDate RPG Review Completed (Month/Yr)\tRequired for submitted Tier 1, 2, and 3 projects, if RPG review has been completed.\nDate ERCOT BOD Review Completed\t-Required for submitted Tier 1 projects, if ERCOT BOD review completed.\nSSWG Base Case Related Bus Numbers\tRequired\nIs the project reflected in SSWG Base Cases?\tRequired\nPart of Interface (Y/N)\tRequired\nRequested Additional Information\tOptional\nOther (Optional)\tOptional\nPhase Number & MOD Project Number\tRequired\nTechnical Rationale  \tRequired if using a less limiting facility rating or voltage limit\nOther Rationale (Optional) \tOptional\n3.3.4.2\tLSEs\n\u2022\tEntities not having representation on SSWG shall submit their data to ERCOT staff or to the directly connected TSP, if the TSP has agreed to be the agent on SSWG for that entity.\n\u2022\tSee Section 6.5, Annual Load Date Request of the ERCOT Planning Guide.\n3.3.4.3\tResource and Interconnecting Entities\n\u2022\tIt is the responsibility of REs to provide all data required to accurately model their generators, step-up transformers, associated transmission facilities and reactive devices in the SSWG Cases in accordance with Section 6.8, Resource Registration Procedures of the ERCOT Planning Guide.\n\u2022\tInterconnecting Entities are required to submit data for SSWG Cases in accordance with Section 6.9 of the ERCOT Planning Guide.\n\u2022\tIt is the responsibility of REs to supply any applicable load and/or generation data if they are the designated representatives for either a load or generating entity or both.\n3.3.4.4\tERCOT\n\u2022\tIt is the responsibility of ERCOT staff to maintain the ERCOT MOD production environment that allows SSWG members to provide appropriate equipment characteristics and system data as stated in this procedure.\n\u2022\tERCOT staff shall be responsible for creating each MOD incremental update base case.\n\u2022\tERCOT staff shall be responsible for the review and inclusion of all latest available generator models with each biannual case update, including generator step-up transformers and associated RE-owned transmission facilities, RE-owned reactive devices, in the SSWG Cases.

    "title": "4.2\tLoad Data",
    "text": "Real and reactive load forecasts within the SSWG Cases are populated with data consistent with, but not necessarily identical to, load data submitted through the ALDR process.  In general, the ALDR contains non-coincident load data while the SSWG Cases contain load data coincident with either the individual TSP projected load levels or the ERCOT system projected load level.  Furthermore, some of the loads defined in the SSWG Cases are not contained within the ALDR (e.g. off-peak, Spring, and Fall loads are not defined in the ALDR).  See Planning Guides Section 6.5 for further information about the ALDR process.\nEach load data record contains a bus number, load identifier, load status, area, zone, real and reactive power components of constant MVA load, real and reactive power components of constant current load, and real and reactive power components of constant admittance load.  In general, loads (MW and MVAR) should be modeled on the high side of transformers serving load at less than 60 kV.  However, special conditions may require more modeling detail such as parallel operation of power transformers from different sources.\nLoad Resources are not modeled in the SSWG Cases but are considered a Responsive Reserve.\n4.2.1\tGuidelines\n(1)\tThe bus number in the load data record must be a bus that exists in the SSWG Case.  The load identifier is a two-character alphanumeric identifier used to differentiate between loads at a bus. All self-serve loads must be identified by \u201cSS\u201d. If there are multiple self-serve loads at the same bus, then the self-serve loads will be identified by S1, S2, S3, etc.  See Section 4.3.1.1.  Partial self-serve load should be modeled as a multiple load with \u201cSS\u201d identifying the self-serve portion. See Appendix E for additional details.\n(2)\tThe load data record zone number must be in the zone range of the TSP submitting the load, or in the zone range of ERCOT for loads associated with PUNs.  Zone numbers for loads do not have to be the same as the bus to which the load is connected.\n(3)\tGenerator auxiliary load should not be modeled at generating station buses. Refer to section 4.3.1.\n(4)\tIn conformance with NERC Reliability Standards and the Planning Guide Section 6.5, entities not having representation on SSWG shall submit their load data to ERCOT or, if the directly connected TDSP has agreed to be the agent on SSWG for that entity, to that TSP.  If load data is not timely submitted on the schedule and in the format defined by the TSP, then ERCOT shall calculate loads based on historical data and insert these loads into the SSWG Cases during annual updates.\n(5)\tMultiple loads from different TSPs at a bus may be used. At this time, each TSP can define a load with a load ID of its choice. Careful coordination, however, is required between TSP representatives to ensure that the multiple loads modeled at the same bus are modeled correctly with unique load IDs. See Appendix E for additional details.\n(6)\tGuidelines for modeling DER  are detailed in the following table. DER shall not be modeled as negative load in any case.\nDER Type\tShould be Embedded in Load Forecasts?\tModeled as Generation by ERCOT?\nDGR\tNo\tYes\nDESR\tNo\tYes\nSODG\tNo\tYes\nUDG1 \tYes\tNo\n1Specific guidelines for modeling UDG involve representing the aggregated total nameplate value for UDG behind each load point in each load distributed generation field, with the \u2018Distributed Generation Operator Mode\u2019 field disabled. This is to ensure that only the aggregated total nameplate capability for the UDG is reflected in the models. Enabling the \u2018Distributed Generation Operator Mode\u2019 field could risk disproportionate representation of the UDG contribution due to the load models currently aggregating UDG contributions.\n4.2.2\tLoad Data Source\nNMMS determines the bus where the load is connected.

Net generation is equal to the gross generation minus station auxiliaries and other internal power requirements.  All non-self-serve generation connected at 60 kV and above with at least 10 MW aggregated at the point of interconnect must be explicitly modeled. A generator explicitly modeled must include generator step-up transformer and actual no-load tap position. Generation of less than 10 MW is still required to be modeled, but not explicitly.\nUnit Reactive Limits (leading and lagging) for existing units are obtained from the Resource Registration data.  The Resource Registration data should reflect the most recent generator reactive unit test data conducted by the RE.  Limited Resource Registration data shall be made available to SSWG upon request.\nGenerator reactive limits should be modeled with one value for Qmax and one value for Qmin as described below:\nQmax\n\nQmax is the maximum net lagging MVAr observed at the low side of the generator step up transformer when the unit is operating at its maximum net dependable MW capability. Qmax is calculated from the lagging Resource Registration data MW4 MVar value by subtracting Resource Registration data auxiliary load MVAr.\n\nExample:\n\nResource Registration data lagging MW4 value is 85 MVAr\nResource Registration data auxiliary Load is 5 MVAr\nIn this example, Qmax is 85 \u2013 5 = 80 MVAr\n\nQmin\n\nQmin is the maximum net leading MVAr observed at the low side of the generator step up transformer when the unit is operating at its maximum net dependable MW capability. Qmin is calculated from the leading Resource Registration data MW4 MVar value by subtracting Resource Registration data auxiliary load MVAr.\n\nExample:\n\nResource Registration data leading MW4 value is -55 MVAr\nResource Registration data auxiliary Load is 5 MVAr\nIn this example, Qmin is -55 \u2013 5 = -60 MVAr\n4.3.1.3\tSelf-Serve Generation\nSelf-serve generators serve local load that does not flow through the ERCOT transmission system. Generation dispatch may be submitted by TSPs on a biannual basis for self-serve facilities serving self-serve load modeled in the SSWG Case. If no generation dispatch is submitted by the TSPs, ERCOT will dispatch the units accordingly to meet the self-serve load.  Total self-serve generation MWs shall match total self-serve load MWs.\n4.3.1.4\tDistribution Generation Resources, Distribution Energy Storage Resources, and Settlement Only Distribution Generators\nERCOT will utilize Resource Registration data provided by IEs/REs to model DGR, DESR, and SODG. SODG will be aggregated by fuel type and represented as a simple model and will be assumed to operate at unity power factor with no voltage control.\n4.3.1.5\tCoordination with other ERCOT Working Groups\nAll generator data should be coordinated with the Dynamics Working Group, Operations Working Group, Network Data Support Working Group and System Protection Working Group members to assure that it is correct before submitting the cases. This will insure that all of the cases have the most current steady state and dynamics information.  The following items should be provided to these working groups for data coordination:\n\u2022\tUnit bus number\n\u2022\tUnit ID\n\u2022\tUnit maximum and minimum real power capabilities\n\u2022\tUnit maximum and minimum reactive power capabilities\n\u2022\tUnit MVA base\n\u2022\tResistive and reactive machine impedances\n\u2022\tResistive and reactive generator step-up transformer impedances\n\u2022\tReactive devices modeled on the Generator side\n4.3.2\tLoad and Generation Balance\nBefore the generation schedule can be determined, the expected ERCOT load and losses (demand) must be determined. Each MW of demand needs to be accounted for by a MW of generation.\n4.3.3\tGeneration Dispatch Methodology for Planning Purposes\nIn order to simulate the future market, the following methodology for generation dispatch has been adopted for building the  Steady State Cases, with the exception of the HRML case. The HRML case build process is described separately below. Generation dispatch, as described below, is for planning and may not necessarily reflect the actual real-time dispatch.\nExisting and planned units owned by Non-Opt-In Entities (NOIE) are dispatched according to the NOIE dispatch spreadsheets submitted to ERCOT on a biannual basis; unless a NOIE requests that their units are to be dispatched according to the order that is described below or do not submit a NOIE dispatch.\nPrivate network generation is also dispatched independently. The units are dispatched to meet their load modeled in the case. The import/export contributions of the DC Ties will be set based on historical data to the extent that the contributions are consistent with those indicated in the most recent Capacity, Demand and Reserves (CDR) Report.  Likewise, wind units are dispatched in accordance with Appendix B, Method for Calculating Wind Generation Levels in SSWG Cases, to extent that the dispatch is consistent with the regional contributions indicated in the CDR Report. Solar units are dispatched at a level consistent with the CDR Report. Battery Energy Storage units are dispatched at a level consistent with the CDR Report for On-Peak Cases.\nUnits that are solely for black start purposes are to be modeled in the SSWG Cases; however, these units should not be dispatched.  Black Start units are designated with a unit ID of \u201cBS\u201d.\nAll other transmission level units are dispatched using an economic-simulation software package. Units will be dispatched to minimize production costs taking into account unit start-up times and cost and heat rates while adhering to the following guidelines for each set of cases: (YR is the year the case is created)\n\nSSWG CASE\tNOTES\tTRANSMISSION IN-SERVICE DATE\n(YR+1) SPG1\t1\tApril 1, (YR+1)\n(YR+1) SPG2\t1\tApril 1, (YR+1)\n(YR+1) SUM1\t1\tJuly 1, (YR+1)\n(YR+1) SUM2\t1\tJuly 1,

generation\nvii.\tIf there remains load to be served ((MIN load \u2013 sum of nuclear/PUN/reserve PGEN/renewables) > 0), dispatch conventional units on a least cost basis to serve the remaining

Overall renewable output should be preserved and if renewables are dispatched downwards to meet GTC limits, then the capacity should be allocated to another region.\nix.\tThe Panhandle wind region should remain above 70% capacity factor.\nx.\tIf the case cannot be solved at given renewable output, adjust generation as needed.\nDGR and DESR shall be committed and dispatched using the same methodology as transmission-connected Resources of the same type. SODG shall be committed and dispatched based on their resource type as noted in the following table.\nSODG Resource Type\tCommitment / Dispatch\nBattery\tOffline\nSolar\tConsistent with CDR solar percent capacity contribution\nNatural Gas\tOffline\nDiesel\tOffline\nWind\tConsistent with CDR wind percent capacity contribution\nLandfill Gas\tOffline\nHydro\tOffline\nOther Inverter-Based Resources\tOffline\nOther Synchronous Generation\tOffline\n\nSSWG members shall be able to review and suggest changes to the generation dispatch based on historical information.\nIn all cases spinning reserve is maintained according to ERCOT Nodal Operating Guides, Section 2.3.1.1, to the extent that the extraordinary dispatch conditions in Section 4.3.3.1 Item 1 of this guide are not deployed.  Specifically, spinning reserve is maintained such that 50% of the Responsive Reserve Service obligation is made up of generation resources with the other 50% of Responsive Reserve Service obligation coming from Load Resources.  The dispatch may be modified in the seasonal SSWG Cases if necessary to maintain voltages at acceptable levels.\nNew transmission level Generation Resources will be included in the SSWG Cases on a biannual basis according to the procedures defined in Planning Guide, Section 6.9, addition of Proposed Generation Resources to the Planning Models.\nNew DGRs, DESRs, and SODGs will be included in the SSWG Cases on a biannual basis during the incremental updates with operational data from NMMS.\n4.3.3.1 \tExtraordinary Dispatch Conditions\nOn occasion, the total load plus the spinning reserve indicated above can exceed the amount of available generation due to load forecasts.  SSWG Cases typically model load at individual coincident TSP peaks instead of at the ERCOT coincident system peak.  When such a condition is encountered in future cases, ERCOT may increase generation resources by taking the indicated action, or adding generation, in the following order:\n\n1.\tIgnore spinning reserve.\n2.\tIncrease NOIE generation with prior NOIE consent.\n3.\tDC ties dispatched to increase transfers into ERCOT to the full capacity of the DC ties.\n4.\tDispatch SODG natural gas and diesel units up to their full capacity.\n5.\tDispatch units that have changed their status to indefinite mothball within the last 18 months and that have not announced their return to service.

The project name shall contain the ERCOT GINR.\n(3)\tERCOT will model SODGs in using the \u201cStandard PMCR\u201d project type in MOD.\n(4)\tTSPs may model resource and resource equipment not requiring ERCOT registration and not required by the Generation Interconnection process if they desire the resource to be in the SSWG case.\n(5)\tERCOT shall update the PMAX and PMIN values based upon the Resource Registration Data net seasonal sustainable ratings.  The generator identifier is a two-character alphanumeric identifier used to differentiate between generators at a bus. All self-serve generators must be identified by P1. If there are multiple self-serve generators at the same bus, then self-serve generators must be identified by P1, P2, P3, etc. Self-serve economic generators must be identified by \u201cPE\u201d.\n(6)\tRefer to Appendix D for the generator identifiers used in the SSWG cases.\n(7)\tIn extraordinary dispatch scenarios, the following generator zones should be assigned by ERCOT:\n\nExtraordinary Dispatch Step\nZone Number\tZone Name\n4. & 7. Mothballed units that have not announced their return to service.\t1195\tEX_MB\n6.

For publicly announced units without interconnect agreements.\t1197\tEX_PUB_NOIA\n12. For generation resources added to the 345 kV transmission system near the sites of existing or retired units.\t1198\tEX_FAKEGEN\n\nMethodology for Dispatching Mothballed Units\nIn order to minimize the effect on transmission plans of the decision to use mothballed units to meet the load requirement, the generation that is needed from mothballed units as a group will be allocated over all the mothballed units on a capacity ratio share basis.  If this technique results in some of the mothballed units being dispatched at a level below their minimum load, an economic ranking will be used to remove the least economic units from consideration for that particular case so that the allocation of the load requirement among the remaining mothballed units will result in all of those units being loaded above their minimum loads.\nFor example, assume that, in some future year, ERCOT has a projected peak demand of 80,000MW and a total installed resource capacity of 82,000MW, with 3000MW of that installed capacity being units that are mothballed and have not indicated they will return.  For this simple example, assume that the mothballed capacity is 20 generating units of equal 150MW size.  Ignoring losses and spinning reserve requirement, the steady-state case would need to include 1000MW of the 3000MW mothballed capacity in order to match the load.   Thus, each of the 20 mothballed units would be set to an output of 50MW in the steady-state case (assuming their minimum load is less than 50MW).\nConsideration of Alternative Dispatch for Studies\nWhile this treatment of mothballed units attempts to generally minimize the effect of the assumption that mothballed units will be used to meet the load requirement in the SSWG Cases (rather than assumed new generation), the planning process should also consider alternative generation dispatches in instances where this treatment of mothballed units could have a direct effect on transmission plans.  Specifically, in instances where having a mothballed unit available would alleviate the need for a transmission project that would be required to meet reliability criteria if the mothballed unit were not to return, the transmission project should not be deferred based on the assumption that the mothballed unit will return to service.\n4.3.4\tVoltage Profile Adjustments\nAfter the generation dispatch has been determined, the expected voltage profile for the system can be applied. The scheduled voltages should reflect actual voltage set points used by the generator operators.\nTSPs should check the voltages at several key locations within the system when modifying generation control voltages and reactive devices.  Voltage profile changes can be accomplished by turning on/turning off capacitors or reactors, and by changing the operations of generators (turning on/turning off/redispatching for VAR control). The cases should ultimately model system voltages that could be reasonably expected to occur.\n4.3.5\tGenerator Data Source\nData Element\tSource For Existing  Elements\tSource For Planned Elements\nBus Number\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nBus Name\tNMMS \tMOD PMCR\nMachine ID\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nBus Code\tNMMS \tMOD PMCR\nV Schedule\tMOD PROFILES\tMOD PROFILES\nRemote Bus (Voltage Control)\tMOD PMCR\tMOD PROFILES\nRMPCT\tMOD PROFILES\tMOD PROFILES\nPGen (MW)\tDISPATCH - MOD PROFILES\tDISPATCH - MOD PROFILES\nQGen (Mvar)\tDISPATCH - MOD PROFILES\tDISPATCH - MOD PROFILES\nPMax (MW)\tResource Registration Data - NMMS\tResource Registration Data - MOD PROFILES\nPMin (MW)\tResource Registration Data - NMMS\tResource Registration Data - MOD PROFILES\nQMax (Mvar) \tResource Registration Data - NMMS\tResource Registration Data - MOD PROFILES\nQMin (Mvar)2 \tResource Registration Data - NMMS\tResource Registration Data - MOD PROFILES\nMbase (MVA)2 \tResource Registration Data - NMMS\tResource Registration Data - MOD PMCR\nR Source (pu)2\tResource Registration Data - NMMS\tResource Registration Data - MOD PMCR\nX Source (pu)2\tResource Registration Data - NMMS\tResource Registration Data - MOD PMCR\nOwner\tResource Registration Data - NMMS\tResource Registration Data - MOD PMCR\nGenerator Step-up Unit (GSU) ID\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nGSU Tap positions2\tResource Registration Data - NMMS\tResource Registration Data - MOD PMCR\nGSU Tap Controls2\tResource Registration Data - NMMS\tResource Registration Data - MOD PMCR\nGSU Specified R 2\tResource Registration Data - NMMS\tResource Registration Data - MOD PMCR\nGSU Specified X 2\tResource Registration Data - NMMS\tResource Registration Data - MOD PMCR\nRate 1 / Rate 2/ Rate 3 / Rate 4 / Rate 5\tResource Registration Data - NMMS\tResource Registration Data - MOD PMCR\n\nData Element\tSource For Existing  Elements\tSource For Planned Elements\nGenerator Reactive Devices Control Mode2\tResource Registration Data - NMMS\tResource Registration Data - MOD PMCR\nGenerator Reactive Devices Vhi (pu)2\tResource Registration Data - MOD PROFILES\tResource Registration Data - MOD PROFILES\nGenerator Reactive Devices Vlo (pu)2\tResource Registration Data - MOD PROFILES\tResource Registration Data - MOD PROFILES\nGenerator Reactive Devices Binit (Mvar)\tMOD PROFILES\tMOD PROFILES\nGenerator Reactive Devices Bsteps (Mvar)2\tResource Registration Data - NMMS\tResource Registration Data - MOD PMCR\nWind Machine Control Mode\tNMMS- / MOD PMCR\tMOD PMCR\nWind Machine Power Factor\tNMMS/MOD PMCR\tMOD PMCR\nDER Model Data\tNMMS/MOD PMCR\tN/A"

    "title": "4.4\tBranch Data",
    "text": "4.4.1\tUse of Branch Record Data Fields\nAll existing and planned transmission lines (60 kV and above) shall be modeled in the SSWG Cases.\n4.4.1.1\tBus Specifications\nThe end points of each branch in the SSWG Cases are specified by \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cto\u201d bus numbers.  In most cases the end point buses are in the same TSP area.  However, when the \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cto\u201d buses used to specify a branch are in different TSP areas, the branch is considered to be a tie line (See Section 4.4.3, Coordination of Tie Lines). Branch data includes exactly two buses. The end points of Multi-Section Lines (MSL) are defined by two buses specified in a branch data record (See Section 4.4.2). There are other components that are modeled with more than two buses, such as transformers with tertiary that may be represented by three-bus models.\n4.4.1.2\tBranch Circuit Identifier\nCircuit identifiers are limited to two alphanumeric characters.  Each TSP will determine its own naming convention for circuit identifiers.  ERCOT will determine its own naming convention for branches owned by REs and PUNs with careful coordination with connected TSPs.  These identifiers are typically numeric values (e.g. 1 or 2) that indicate the number of branches between two common buses, but many exceptions exist.\n4.4.1.3\tBranch Impedance and Admittance Data\nThe branch resistance, reactance, and admittance data contained in the SSWG Cases are expressed in per-unit quantities that are calculated from a base impedance. The base impedance for transmission lines is calculated from the system base MVA and the base voltage of the transmission branch of interest.  The system base MVA used in the SSWG Cases is 100 MVA (S = 100 MVA).  The base voltage for a transmission line branch is the nominal line-to-line voltage of that particular transmission branch (See Transformer Data for Calculation of Transformer Impedances). Therefore the base impedance used for calculating transmission branch impedances is:\n\nOhms\nThis base impedance is then used to convert the physical quantities of the transmission line into per-unit values to be used in the SSWG Cases.\n4.4.1.3.1\tResistance\nOnce the total transmission line resistance is known and expressed in ohms, then this value is divided by the base impedance to obtain the per-unit resistance to be used in the SSWG Cases.  This calculation is as follows:\n\n4.4.1.3.2\tReactance\nOnce the total transmission line reactance is known and expressed in ohms, then this value is divided by the base impedance to obtain the per-unit reactance to be used in the SSWG Cases.  This calculation is as follows:\n\n4.4.1.3.3\tAdmittance\nBranch admittance is expressed as total branch charging susceptance in per unit on the 100 MVA system base.  The total branch charging is expressed in MVARs and divided by the system base MVA to get per unit charging.  The equation used to accomplish this depends on the starting point. Typically the charging of a transmission line is known in KVARs.  Given the total transmission line charging expressed in KVARs, the equation to calculate the total branch charging susceptance in per unit on the system base is as follows:\n\n\nOr, given the total capacitive reactance to neutral expressed in ohms  , the equation to calculate the total branch charging susceptance in per unit on the system base is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n4.4.1.4\tFacility Ratings\nSSWG Cases contain fields for five ratings for each branch record, including zero impedance branches.  The ratings associated with these five fields are commonly referred to as Rate 1, Rate 2, Rate 3, Rate 4, and Rate 5.  Each TSP has their own methodology for calculating these ratings and shall be made available to others within ERCOT upon request. Following are the SSWG Case facility ratings corresponding to the ratings defined in Nodal Protocol 2.1:\n\nPlanning Case Rating Definitions\tCorresponding Nodal Protocol Section 2.1 Definitions\nRate 1\tNormal Rating\nRate 2\tEmergency Rating\nRate 3\t 15-Minute Rating\nRate 4\tTransformer 2-Hour/Branch Conductor Rating\nRate 5\tRelay Loadability Rating\n\nBy definition, Rate 5 \u2265 Rate 3 \u2265 Rate 2 \u2265 Rate 1 and Rate 4 \u2265 Rate 2 \u2265 Rate 1.\n\nWhen performing security studies, ERCOT will default to Rate 2, unless the TSP has previously indicated in writing that other ratings (e.g., Rate 1) should be used.  If problems exist using Rate 2 and Rate 2 is significantly different from Rate 4, then ERCOT will contact the TSP. There may also be 8888 or 9999 ratings in the SSWG Cases. The 8888 rating represents items such as change of ownership at a substation facility, a radial Point Of Interconnect to a customer, normally open facilities inside a substation used for load transfer and other similar situations that are not an integral part of the transmission grid itself. The 8888 ratings are used by the facility owner to indicate they have reviewed the rating. The 9999 ratings are a default value assigned to facilities by the NMMS system as part of the base case preparation; they apply to similar situations as the 8888 ratings and are not an integral part of the transmission grid itself. For Rate 5, the default value for an element that is not protected by a relay loadability rating is 88888, and the default value for an element that will be protected by a relay loadability rating which hasn\u2019t been determined yet is 99999.\n4.4.1.4.1\tMost Limiting Series Element\nFacility ratings shall not exceed the most limiting applicable equipment rating of the individual equipment that comprises the facility. If the continuous or two (2) hour ratings of any series elements at the station terminals is less than the associated transmission line\u2019s continuous or two (2) hour rating, then the most limiting elements\u2019 rating data will be used as the Rate 1 and/or Rate 2 rating for the transmission line.  The scope of equipment addressed shall include, but not be limited to, conductors, transformers, relay protective devices, terminal equipment, and series and shunt compensation devices.\n4.4.1.5\tShunt Admittance\nBranch Data records include four fields for complex admittance for line shunts.  These records are rarely used in the SSWG Cases.\n4.4.1.6\tStatus\nBranch data records include a field for branch status.  Entities are allowed to submit branch data with an out-of-service status for equipment normally out of service.\n4.4.1.7\tLine Length and Ownership\n4.4.1.7.1\tLine Length\nThis data will be provided in miles.\n4.4.1.7.2\tOwnership\nOwner IDs are assigned by ERCOT.  The PSS\u00aeE line data record allows the specification of up to four owners for each branch including percent ownership. The percent ownership of each line should sum up to 100%.  Facilities owned by Generators will be assigned a non-TSP ownership ID in the SSWG Cases.\n\nOSRs are ratings submitted by jointly owned facility Owners for their specific ratings  to ERCOT Network Operational Models.\n4.4.1.7.3\tPractices for Verification\nTransmission line length for existing lines should be verified from field data and actual values entered into the power flow model.  A simple check can be utilized to verify certain modeling parameters for overhead lines.  The following equation is an approximation that applies to transmission lines that are completely overhead or assuming    MVA then\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2\tMulti-Section Line Grouping\nA multi-section line is defined as a grouping of several previously defined branches into one long circuit having several sub-sections or segments.\n\nExample: Two circuits exist (Figure 1) which originate at the same substation (4001) and terminate at the same substation (4742).  Each circuit has a tap to Substation A and a tap to Substation B.  If a fault occurs or maintenance requires an outage of Circuit 09, the circuit would be out-of-service between bus 4001 and bus 4742 including the taps to buses 4099 and 4672.  The loads normally served by these taps would be served by means of low-side rollover to buses 4100 and 4671 on Circuit 21.  This is the type of situation for which multi-section lines are used to accurately model load flows.\n\n\nFigure 1.  Example of circuits needing to use multi-section line modeling.\n\nFigure 2 represents a power-flow data model of the circuits in Figure 1.  Branch data record would have included the following:\n4001,4099,09,\u2026\n4099,4672,09,\u2026\n4672,4742,09,\u2026\n4001,4100,21,\u2026\n4100,4671,21,\u2026\n4671,4742,21,\u2026\nalong with the necessary bus, load, and shunt data.  To identify these two circuits as multi-section lines, entries must be made in the raw data input file.  The multi-section line data record format is as follows:\n\n\nI,J,ID,DUM1,DUM2, \u2026 DUM9  where :\n\nI\t\u201cFrom bus\u201d number.\nJ\t\u201cTo bus\u201d number.\nID\tTwo characters multi-section line grouping identifier. The first character must be an ampersand (\u201c&\u201d).

No defaults allowed.\n\nUp to 10 line sections (and 9 dummy buses) may be defined in each multi-section line grouping.  A branch may be a line section of at most one multi-section line grouping.\n\nEach dummy bus must have exactly two branches connected to it, both of which must be members of the same multi-section line grouping.\n\nThe status of line sections and type codes of dummy buses are set such that the multi-section line is treated as a single element.\n\n\nFigure 2. Power-flow model of example circuits.\n\nFor our example, the following would be entered as multi-section line data records:\n4001, 4742, &1, 4099, 4672\n4001, 4742, &2, 4100, 4671\nMulti-section lines give a great amount of flexibility in performing contingency studies on SSWG Cases.  When set up correctly, where automatic low-side load rollover occurs, hundreds of contingencies can be analyzed and reported within minutes.\n\n4.4.3\tCoordination of Tie Lines\nA tie line is defined as any transmission circuit with multiple owners represented within the context of the transmission circuit\u2019s associated facility.  As used here, a transmission circuit\u2019s associated facility includes all terminal buses as well as the transmission branch, transformer, bus section, or another electrical component connecting systems together.  For a tie line, each of the interconnected entities (TSP/TSP or TSP/RE) owns one or more elements of the tie line\u2019s associated facility.\n\nCareful coordination and discussion is required among SSWG members to verify all modeled tie line data.  Even in situations where no new tie lines are added to a network model, there could be many tie line changes.  Construction timing for future points of interconnection or modified existing points of interconnection can change.  As a result, a tie line may need to be deleted from some cases and added to others (e.g. deleted from spring cases and added to summer cases).  Additionally, a new substation installed in the middle of an existing tie line can redefine the tie line\u2019s bus numbers, mileages, impedances, ratings, or ownership.\n\nTie line models also affect a number of important ERCOT calculations and therefore must accurately reflect real-world conditions.  Missing, redundant, or erroneous tie line models can produce unrealistic indications of stability and/or voltage limits.  Inaccurate impedances, ratings, transformer adjustment data, status information, mileages, or ownership data can all have a profound effect on system studies.  Therefore, it is imperative that neighboring entities exercise care in coordinating tie line data.\nRatings for tie lines should be mutually agreed upon by all involved entities and should comply with NERC Reliability Standards.\n\nIt is imperative for neighboring entities to coordinate tie line data in order to allow Planning Case work activities to proceed unimpeded. Entities should exchange tie-line data at least two weeks before the data is due to ERCOT. Coordination of tie line data includes timely agreement between entities on the following for each tie line:\n\u2022\tIn-service/ out-service dates for ties\n\u2022\tFrom bus number\n\u2022\tTo bus number\n\u2022\tCircuit identifier\n\u2022\tImpedance and charging data\n\u2022\tRatings\n\u2022\tTransformer adjustment (LTC) data\n\u2022\tStatus of branch\n\u2022\tCircuit miles\n\u2022\tOwnership (up to four owners)\n\u2022\tEntity responsible for submitting data\n\nOSRs can be submitted separately into NMMS/MAGE but for PMCRs in MOD only one set of ratings can be submitted.  Impedance and length are only allowed to have one submission, the majority owner of the tie line should submit this data to NMMS/MAGE and MOD and ensure that they are accounting for any other modeling information for connecting entities.\n\n\n4.4.4\tMetering Point\nEach tie line or branch has a designated metering point and this designation may also be coordinated between neighboring TSP areas.  The location of the metering point determines which TSP area will account for losses on the tie branch.  PSS\u00aeE software allocates branch losses to the TSP area of the un-metered bus.  For example, if the metering point is located at the \u201cto\u201d bus then branch losses will be allocated to the TSP area of the \u201cfrom\u201d bus.  The first bus specified in the branch record is the default location of the metering point unless the second bus is entered as a negative number. These are the first and second data fields in the branch record.\n4.4.5\tBranch Data Source\nData Element\tSource For Existing  Elements\tSource For Planned Elements\nFrom Bus Number\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nFrom Bus Name\tNMMS \tMOD PMCR\nTo Bus Number\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nTo Bus Name\tNMMS \tMOD PMCR\nID\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nResistance R (pu) \tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nReactance X (pu)4\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nCharging Susceptance (pu) \tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nBranch Status\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nRate 1/Rate 2/ Rate 3 / Rate 4 / Rate 5 (MVA)\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nLine Length (Miles)\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nOwner \tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nRE or PUN Owned Branch data\tResource Registration Data - NMMS\tResource Registration Data - MOD PMCR\nMulti-Section Line\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR"

    "title": "4.5\tTransformer Data",
    "text": "4.5.1\tUse of Transformer Record Data Fields\nAll existing and planned transformers are to be represented in the SSWG Cases.  Transformer data records specify all the data necessary to model transformers in power flow calculations.  Both two winding transformers and three winding transformers can be specified in the SSWG Cases.\n4.5.1.1\tBus Specifications\nThe end points of each transformer in the SSWG Cases are specified by \u201cwinding 1\u201d and \u201cwinding 2\u201d bus numbers.  In some cases, the \u201cwinding 1\u201d and \u201cwinding 2\u201d buses used to specify a transformer are in two different TSP areas, making the transformer a tie line (See Section 4.4.3, Coordination of Tie Lines). Three winding transformers (transformers with a tertiary winding) can be represented by specifying a \u201cwinding 3\u201d bus number in the data to represent the tertiary winding.\n4.5.1.2\tTransformer Circuit Identifier\nCircuit identifiers are limited to two alphanumeric characters. Each TSP will determine its own naming convention for circuit identifiers. Actual transformer identifiers may be used for circuit identifiers for transformers, however, typically, circuit identifiers are used to indicate which transformer is being defined when more than one transformer is modeled between two common buses. TSP\u2019s can identify autotransformers with the letter A as the first character of the ID field.  Generator Step-Up transformers can be identified with the letter G.  Phase-shifting transformers can be identified with the letter P.\n4.5.1.3\tImpedance and Admittance Data\nThe resistance and reactance data for transformers in the SSWG Cases can be specified in one of three ways: (1) in per-unit on 100 MVA system base (default), (2) in per-unit on winding base MVA and winding bus base voltage, (3) in transformer load loss in watts and impedance magnitude in per-unit on winding base MVA and winding bus base voltage.  Transformer resistance and reactance data supplied from the Topology Processor are specified in per-unit on 100 MVA system base.\n4.5.1.3.1\tResistance\nTransformer test records should be used to calculate the resistance associated with a transformer record. Where transformer test records are unavailable, the resistance should be entered as either a value similar to a comparable transformer or zero.\n4.5.1.3.2\tReactance\nTransformer test records or transformer nameplate impedance should be used to calculate the reactance associated with a transformer record. Where the transformer resistance component is known, the transformer reactance is calculated on the same base using the known data and the reactance component is determined using the Pythagorean Theorem. Where the transformer resistance is assumed to be zero, the calculated transformer reactance can be assumed to be equal to the transformer impedance.\n4.5.1.3.3\tSusceptance\nFor power-flow modeling purposes, the transformer susceptance is always assumed to be zero.\n\n\n4.5.1.4\tTransformer Ratings\nThe ratings used for transformer are defined the same as the ratings used for branches described in Section 4.4.1.4.\n4.5.1.5\tStatus\nTransformer data records include a field for status.  Entities are allowed to submit transformer data with an out-of-service status for equipment normally out of service.\n4.5.1.6\tOwnership\nUp to four owners and corresponding percent ownership can be specified for each transformer in the SSWG Cases. Owner IDs and corresponding percent ownership should be included for all transformers. The sum of all percent ownerships should equal 100% for every transformer.\n4.5.1.7\tAngle\nIn PSS\u00aeE, the phase shift across a two-winding transformer is specified by an angle referenced to the winding defined as \u201cwinding 1\u201d by the combined logic of the \u201cFrom Bus Number\u201d, \u201cTo Bus Number\u201d and \u201cWinding 1 Side\u201d (From or To logic) fields.  The phase shift angle is positive when the voltage of the bus corresponding to the referenced winding leads the voltage of the bus connected to the opposite winding.\n\nThe phase shift(s) associated with a three-winding transformer is(are) accounted for by the specification of an angle for each of the three windings.  The phase shift angle across a winding is positive when the voltage of the corresponding bus leads the voltage of the star point bus.\n\nThe transformer phase shift angle is measured in degrees for both two-winding and three-winding transformers.\n4.5.1.8\tTap Data\nAll transformer tap characteristics should be appropriately modeled.  Such tap characteristics include no-load tap settings and load tap changing (LTC) properties and associated control settings.\n4.5.1.8.1\tRatio\nThe ratio is defined as the transformer off nominal turns ratio and is entered as a non-zero value, typically in per unit. Where the base kV contained in the bus data records for the buses connected to transformer terminals are equal to the rated voltage of the transformer windings connected to those terminals, the transformer off-nominal ratio is equal to 1.00. When the transformer has no-load taps, the transformer off-nominal ratio can be something other than 1, but is usually in the range of 0.95 to 1.05. The effects of load tap changing (LTC) transformer taps are also handled in the transformer data record.\n4.5.1.8.2\tControl Mode\nThis field enables or disables automatic transformer tap adjustment. Setting this field to a value other than zero (\u201cNone\u201d within PSS\u00aeE) enables automatic adjustment of the LTC or phase shifter as specified by the adjustment data values during power-flow solution activities. Setting this field to zero prohibits automatic adjustment of this transformer during the power-flow solution activities.\n4.5.1.8.3\tControlled Bus\nThe bus number of the bus whose voltage is controlled by the transformer LTC and the transformer turns ratio adjustment option of the power-flow solution activities. This record should be non-zero only for voltage controlling transformers.\n4.5.1.8.4\tTransformer Adjustment Limits\nThese two fields specify the upper and lower limits of the transformer\u2019s turns ratio adjustment or phase shifter\u2019s angle adjustment.  For transformers with automatic tap changer adjustments, these fields are typically populated with values in the range of 0.80 to 1.20 per-unit.  For phase-shifting transformers, these fields may be populated with phase angle adjustment ranges up to +/- 180 degrees, but are typically modeled with values in the range of +30 to -30 degrees.\n4.5.1.8.4.1\tUpper Limit (Rmax)\nThis field defines the maximum upper limit of the off-nominal ratio for voltage or reactive controlling transformers and is typically entered as a per-unit value. The limit should take into account the no-load tap setting of the transformer, if applicable. For a phase shifting transformer, the value is entered in degrees.\n4.5.1.8.4.2\tLower Limit (Rmin)\nSimilar to the upper limit, this field defines the lower limit of the off-nominal ratio or phase shift angle for the transformer defined.\n\n4.5.1.8.5\tVoltage or Power-Flow Limits\nThese two fields specify the upper and lower voltage limits at the controlled bus or for the real or reactive load flow through the transformer at the tapped side bus before automatic LTC adjustment will be initiated by the power-flow program. As long as bus voltage, or real power flow for phase shifting transformers, is between the two limits, no LTC adjustment will take place during the power-flow solution activities.\n4.5.1.8.5.1\tUpper Limit (Vmax)\nThis field specifies the upper limit for bus voltage in per unit at the controlled bus or for the reactive load flow in MVAR at the tapped side bus. For a phase shifting transformer, this field specifies the upper limit for the real power load flow in MW. Direction for power flow across the phase shifting transformer is referenced from the bus side defined as the \u201cWinding 1\u201d bus.  Negative upper (and lower) limit values for phase shifting transformers imply power flow from the \u201cWinding 2\u201d bus to the \u201cWinding 1\u201d bus.\n4.5.1.8.5.2\tLower Limit (Vmin)\nSimilar to the upper limit, this field specifies the lower limit for the bus voltage or the real or reactive load flow for the transformer defined.\n4.5.1.8.6\tTap Positions Step\nTransformer test records or nameplate data should be used to identify the number of tap positions available for a transformer\u2019s LTC, along with the corresponding maximum and minimum turns ratio adjustment capabilities (i.e. Rmax and Rmin).  The transformer\u2019s turns ratio step increment for a LTC can be calculated based upon data present in the \u201cTap Positions\u201d, \u201cRmax\u201d, and \u201cRmin\u201d fields of the transformer\u2019s PSS\u00aeE model.  A common range for a LTC turns ratio step increment is +/- 10 % over 33 tap positions (32 steps), which corresponds to 5/8% or 0.00625 per unit voltage increment per tap step.\n4.5.1.8.7\tTable\nThe number of a transformer impedance correction table is specified by this field if the transformer's impedance is to be a function of either the off-nominal turns ratio or phase shift angle. SSWG Cases normally don\u2019t use these tables and this field is set to zero by default.\n4.5.1.9\tMagnetizing Admittance\nMagnetizing admittance data is not required for SSWG Cases and the values for each of these two fields should be zero.\n4.5.1.10\tLoad Drop Compensation\nThese two fields define the real and reactive impedance compensation components for voltage controlling transformers. They are ignored for MW and MVAR flow controlling transformers. SSWG Cases normally don\u2019t use these fields and they are set to zero by default.\n4.5.1.10.1\tResistive Component\nThe resistive component of load drop compensation entered in per unit is based on the resistance between the location of the LTC and the point in the system at which voltage is to be regulated.\n4.5.1.10.2\tReactive Component\nSimilar to the resistive component of load drop compensation, this value is entered in per unit and is based on the reactance between the location of the LTC and the point in the system at which voltage is to be regulated.\n4.5.2\tTransformer Data Source\nData Element\tSource For Existing  Elements\tSource For Planned Elements\nFrom Bus Number\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nFrom Bus Name\tNMMS \tMOD PMCR\nTo Bus Number\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nTo Bus Name\tNMMS \tMOD PMCR\nLast Bus Number\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nLast Bus Name\tNMMS \tMOD PMCR\nID\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nTransformer Name\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nResistance R (pu) \tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nReactance X (pu)6\tNMMS \tMOD PMCR\nSusceptance\tNMMS or N/A\tMOD PMCR or N/A\nRate 1/Rate 2/ Rate 3 / Rate 4 / Rate 5\tNMMS \tMOD PMCR\nStatus\tNMMS/ MOD STD PMCR\tMOD PMCR\nOwner\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nAngle (phase-shift)\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nTap Ratio\tMOD PROFILES\tMOD PROFILES\nControl Mode\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nControlled Bus\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nTransformer Adjustment Limits\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR\nVoltage or Power-flow Limits\tMOD PROFILES\tMOD PROFILES\nTransformer Tap Step\tNMMS\tMOD PMCR"

    "title": "4.6\tStatic Reactive Devices",
    "text": "All existing and planned static reactors and capacitors that are used to control voltage at the transmission level are to be modeled in the SSWG Cases to simulate actual transmission operation. There are two distinct static reactive devices currently represented in the SSWG Cases: shunt devices and series devices.\n4.6.1\tShunt Devices\n4.6.1.1\tSwitched Shunt Devices\nA shunt capacitor or reactor located in a station for the purpose of controlling the transmission voltage can be represented in the SSWG Cases as a switched shunt device to accurately simulate operating conditions.  Care should be exercised when specifying the size of cap banks. Be sure that the rated size of the bank is for 1.0 per unit voltage.  Care should be taken to ensure that distribution level capacitors are not modeled in such a way as to be counted twice.\nWhen a switched capacitor or reactor is submitted as the switched shunt data record, there are three modes that it can operate in: fixed, discrete, or continuous.  Switched capacitors are to be modeled in the mode in which they are operated.\nA switched shunt can be represented as up to eight blocks of admittance, each one consisting of up to nine steps of the specified block admittance. The switched shunt device can be a mixture of reactors and capacitors.  The reactor blocks are specified first in the data record (in the order in which they are switched on), followed by the capacitor blocks (in the order in which they are switched on). The complex admittance (p.u.), the desired upper limit voltage (p.u.), desired lower limit voltage (p.u.), and the bus number of the bus whose voltage is regulated must be defined to accurately simulate the switched shunt device. A positive reactive component of admittance represents a shunt capacitor and a negative reactive component represents a shunt reactor.\n4.6.1.2\tFixed Shunt Devices\nA shunt capacitor or reactor located in a station for the purpose of controlling the transmission voltage can be represented in the SSWG Cases as a fixed shunt device to accurately simulate operating conditions.  Care should be exercised when specifying the size of cap banks. Be sure that the rated size of the bank is for 1.0 per unit voltage.  Care should be taken to ensure that distribution level capacitors are not modeled in such a way as to be counted twice.\n\nMultiple fixed shunts can be modeled at a bus, each with a unique ID.  These fixed shunts have a status that can be set to on or off.\n\nA positive reactive component of admittance represents a shunt capacitor and a negative reactive component represents a shunt reactor.\n\n4.6.1.3\tDummy Bus Shunt\nIf a switchable or fixed capacitor or reactor were connected to a transmission line instead of a station bus, an outage of the transmission line would also cause the capacitor or reactor to be taken out of service (see Figure 3).  For these instances, the most accurate model is the switched shunt modeled at a dummy bus connected by a zero impedance branch to the real station bus.  This dummy bus must have exactly two branches connected to it, both of which must be members of the same multi-section line grouping.  The status of the line section is that the multi-section line is treated as a single element.  A shunt capacitor or reactor connected to a line but modeled as a shunt within a station will result in power-flow calculations for contingencies that differ from real operating conditions.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Example one-line of line connected capacitor bank\n\n4.6.2\tSeries Devices\nSeries capacitors and reactors will be modeled as a series branch with the appropriate impedance.

Separate calculations are performed for the eight seasonal SSWG Cases: spring, summer, fall, and winter with an on and off peak for each season.\n\nThe Non Opt In Entities (NOIE) that provide metering of their system load to the ERCOT settlement system by a set of ERCOT Polled Settlements Meters (EPS) that \u2018ring\u2019 their transmission system as defined in Protocol 13.4.1 have additional calculations performed for their transmission loss factors.\n\nThe NOIE that send extra data to ERCOT for the loss calculations have EPS settlement meters on all of their transmission lines that connect or \u201ctie\u201d their system to the rest of the ERCOT transmission network. For the ERCOT settlement process ERCOT calculates their load as the net of inflows minus the outflows from these EPS meters. However calculations must be performed to subtract out the losses on the transmission lines that are \u2018inside\u2019 their EPS meters. If this was not done then these NOIE loads would be too high relative to the other loads where EPS meters are at each delivery point. Other NOIE send EPS metering data from each delivery point so their load can be calculated by summing the individual points. Therefore the extra calculations are not necessary.\n\nThe process for creating the loss factors is outlined below.\n\n1.\tSend out a request to SSWG for any case updates, changes to NOIE bus ranges, and latest self serve data. NOIE\u2019s that have a \u2018ring\u2019 of EPS meters must validate the PSS\u00aeE Metered End data in each of the cases. The PSS\u00aeE Metered End for a transmission facility that is not inside the \u2018ring\u2019 of EPS meters should be Metered \u2018to\u2019 the remote bus, and not Metered \u2018to\u2019 bus where the EPS meter is located.\n2.\tERCOT updates the transmission loss factor spreadsheet.\n3.\tSend to SSWG for review and approval\n4.\tSend to ERCOT settlements (Settlement Metering Manager) to be put into the ERCOT settlement system and post at http://www.ercot.com/mktinfo/data_agg/index.html."

The final value is the average of the previous ten eligible years of Seasonal Peak Average values. Eligible years include 2009 through the most recent year for which COP data is available for the summer and winter Peak Load Seasons.  If the number of eligible years is less than ten, the average shall be based on the number of eligible years available.  This calculation is limited to WGRs that have been in operation as of January 1 for each year of the period used for the calculation.\nWINDCAP s, i, r\tMW\tExisting WGR Capacity\u2014The capacity available for all existing WGRs for the summer and winter Peak Load Seasons s, year i, and region r, multiplied by WINDPEAKPCT for summer and winter Peak Load Seasons s and region r.\n\n\n\n\nAppendix C\nMexico\u2019s Transmission System in ERCOT SSWG Cases\n\nThis appendix provides an explanation of the modeling that represents Mexico\u2019s Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electridad (CFE) system in SSWG cases. A drawing of the system is at the end of this appendix.  All AEP and CFE facilities (bus, lines, etc.) tied to the CFE grid will be assigned to area 24 and zone 612.  The AEP facilities will retain the owner 9 and CFE will be assigned owner 300.\n\nThe following generation modeled in the power flow and short circuit cases are system equivalents of the CFE system and are located in Mexico. These units are not in ERCOT and should only be used for specialized studies. These units should not be included when performing transfer studies in ERCOT unless one is studying a transfer to or from CFE. The generation capability is not counted in ERCOT reports. These units are online in the cases to offset the real and reactive losses that are caused by the other CFE transmission facilities and reactive flow across the Laredo VFT and Railroad HVDC ties that are modeled in the SSWG cases.  Lines in CFE will not be included in the ERCOT contingency list.\n\nGeneration Station Name\tBus Number\tBus Voltage\nCIDINDUS-138 (System Equivalent)\t86104\t138kV\nCIDINDUS-230 (Swing Bus/Equivalent)\t86105\t230kV\nCUF-230 (System Equivalent)\t86106\t230kV\nCUF-138 (System Equivalent)\t86107\t138kV\n\nThe following are the transmission lines between Mexico and the United States.

The VFT is tied to the CFE system by a 12.73 mile 230 kV transmission line and a 12.39 mile normally open 138 kV transmission line.  Both lines terminate at the CFE Ciudad Industrial Substation (86103 and 86104) and are breakered at each end.  There is also a normally open 138 kV transmission line between the Laredo Power Plant (8293) and the Laredo VFT (80169) that is utilized for emergency block load transfers between ERCOT and CFE.  The Laredo Power Plant to Laredo VFT 138 kV transmission line is breakered at both ends.\n\nRailroad\n\nThe HVDC tie in Mission has a detailed model at busses 79604 (ERCOT Side) and 88254 (CFE Side) with a total transfer capability of 300 MW.  The Railroad HVDC is tied to the CFE system at Cumbres (86107) by an 11.79 mile 138 kV transmission line and is breakered at each end.  There is also a normally open bus tie that by-passes the HVDC that is utilized for emergency block load transfers between ERCOT and CFE.  The by-pass is breakered at both ends.\n\n\nNormally Open Block Load Ties\n\nBrownsville Switching Station\n\nThe Brownsville Switching Station (8332) is connected to the CFE Matamoras Substation (86113) by a 1.9 mile 69 kV transmission line and is breakered at each end.  The transmission line is operated normally open and is utilized for emergency block load transfers between ERCOT and CFE.\n\nMilitary Highway\n\nThe Military Highway Substation (8339) is connected to the CFE Matamoras Substation (86112) by a 1.44 mile 138 kV transmission line and is breakered at each end.  The transmission line is operated normally open and is utilized for emergency block load transfers between ERCOT and CFE.\n\nFrontera\n\nThe Frontera Power Plant (86114) is connected to the CFE Cumbres Substation (86107) by a 138 kV transmission line.  This transmission line is privately owned and operated by the owners of the Frontera Power Plant and is utilized to move the generation at Frontera Power Plant between the ERCOT and CFE systems.\n\nFalcon\n\nThe Falcon Substation (8395) is connected to the CFE Falcon Substation (86111) by a .3034 mile 138 kV transmission line and is breakered at each end.  The transmission line is operated normally open and is utilized for emergency block load transfers between ERCOT and CFE.\n\n\n\nNormally Open Block Load Ties on Distribution\n\nThere are three normally open ties with CFE that are on the 12.47 kV distribution systems. These ties are at Amistad, Presido and Redford. These ties are only used for emergency block load transfers. Since SSWG does not model radial distribution systems these points are not in the SSWG power flow cases.\n\n\nAppendix D\nGeneration Unit ID Prefixes\n\nThis appendix provides an explanation of the Generator ID prefixes that correspond to modeling in the SSWG Cases.\nTypes of Generation Unit\tUnit ID Prefix\tUnit ID\tComment\tExplanation\n\nSolar\tS\tS1\tTwo units connected to same bus\nAny type of solar technology\nS2\n\nCoal and Lignite\tL\tL1\tThree units connected to same bus\n\nAny type of thermal power plant\nL2\nL3\n\nNatural Gas except Combined Cycle\tN\tN1\tTwo units connected to same bus & 1 unit connected to another bus\n\nAny type of gas unit\nN2\nN1\n\nCombined Cycle\tC\tC1\t \tAny type of combined cycle plant.

ERCOT coordinates the compilation and publication of dynamics data and dynamics study cases. The dynamics data are published in the form of dynamics study cases (flat start cases) as described within this document.\nThe DWG prepares the annual update of the Stability Book that documents dynamic data used in the flat start cases.\nThe DWG provides a forum for discussing dynamic modeling and system dynamic performance issues and questions.\nThe DWG performs other activities as directed by the Reliability and Operating Subcommittee (ROS).\nAdministrative Procedures\nMembership\nThe DWG is a non-voting working group whose members include representatives from ERCOT, Transmission Service Providers (TSPs), Texas Reliability Entity (Texas RE), and Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT).\nEach NERC Transmission Planner within the ERCOT footprint and each ERCOT TSP with an assigned area in the Steady State Working Group (SSWG) and DWG base cases, shall have at least one designated DWG member.  The designated DWG member(s) shall be an employee(s) of an ERCOT Registered TSP. A Designated Agent that is not a DWG member may represent a DWG member.  Designated Agents are permitted on the DWG email exploder list at the discretion of the sponsoring DWG member under the stipulation that a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is in place with the sponsoring DWG member and proper notification has been provided to ERCOT. It is the responsibility of the sponsoring DWG member to inform ERCOT of Designated Agents acting on their behalf. It is also the responsibility of the sponsoring DWG member to inform ERCOT of Designated Agents that no longer represent them and to have them removed from the email exploder list. The DWG will review the participating Designated Agents annually.\nDWG members and any Designated Agents shall be identified in the DWG roster, and the roster will be updated as needed by the DWG.  The DWG shall notify ROS (in the monthly report) of any TSPs that are required to have a designated DWG member but do not have a DWG representative identified on the DWG roster.\n\nThe DWG will nominate a chair and vice-chair to be approved by the ROS annually.\n\nDuties of Chair and Vice-Chair\nThe chair will coordinate the activities of the DWG and represent the DWG at the ROS meetings and other working group meetings as required.\nThe vice chair will support the chair and fulfill the duties of the chair in the absence of the chair.\nMeetings\nThe DWG will meet at least quarterly. DWG meetings are closed meetings. DWG members and Designated Agents of DWG members may attend. If a Designated Agent is not on the DWG roster, the sponsoring DWG member shall inform ERCOT and the DWG chair and vice chair of the name of the Designated Agent attending one week prior to the meeting.\nThe chair may coordinate additional meetings, including open meetings, as needed to facilitate the activities of the DWG. Non-DWG members may participate in DWG meetings including open portion of the meeting for specific purposes (e.g. a technical presentation or discussion).  Any such participation should be approved by the chair, limited to the specific purpose, announced in the meeting agenda, and recorded in the meeting minutes.  The vice chair will track attendance and document meeting minutes for in-person meetings.\nAgendas and meeting schedules should be published at least two weeks prior to the meeting. The minutes of each meeting will be distributed to DWG members.\nReports to ROS\nEach month, the DWG chair will provide a written report to the ROS if needed.\nDynamic Data Sharing Rules\nDynamic data and dynamic study cases are considered confidential and protected information pursuant to Nodal Protocol Section 1.3, Confidentiality.  They shall be provided to the DWG members only.\n\n\n\nDynamic Data\n\nGeneral\nDynamic data is the network data, mathematical models, and supporting information required for simulation of dynamic and transient events in the ERCOT System.\nSoftware\nThe current planning model software is PSS/E version 35 and PSCAD version 4.5 or higher.  During years where a PSS/E version change is being conducted, the previous PSS/E version user defined models shall also be provided until a full transition is completed.  The current operations model software is Powertech DSATools\u2122 Transient Security Assessment Tool (TSAT) version 22.\nDynamic Models \u2013 General\nDynamic models compatible with the software(s) and version(s) listed in Section 3.1.1 shall be submitted to both ERCOT and the interconnecting TSP.  In addition to the requirements described in the Planning Guide Section 6.2, Dynamics Model Development, providers of dynamic models shall also adhere to the following requirements:\nEach dynamic device requires a model with model parameters that accurately represent the dynamics of the device over the entire range of operating conditions.\nStatic switchable devices part of Inverter-Based Resource (IBR ) facilities (such as on-load tap changing transformers (OLTC) and switchable reactive shunts) should include an initialization script or logic to correctly initialize for the POI initial conditions of the power flow case the model is integrated in (for example, a Python file for PSS/e and initialization logic for PSCAD), and should include switching control logic if the device is expected to switch within 45 seconds of a disturbance .\nPSCAD models shall be submitted to ERCOT for all IBRs, Wind-powered Generation Resources (WGRs), and inverter-based transmission elements (IBTEs)  installed on or after January 2015; for equipment installed before 2015 PSCAD models shall be submitted to ERCOT upon request.  For purposes of this manual, IBTEs includes STATCOMs, static VAR compensators (SVCs), and other transmission devices with power electronic grid interfaces.\nWhere multiple models are provided (e.g. PSS/E, TSAT, PSCAD), the model response shall be consistent across software platforms to the extent of platform capability.\nDynamic models shall utilize proper memory management within the software.  Data must only be written to allocated memory locations so that other models within the system are not affected.\nAll associated per unit dynamic model parameters for a given generating unit shall be provided using a base MVA (MBASE) in accordance with appropriate modeling techniques for the software platform, where the MBASE is typically the generator MVA rating.\nNo model shall restrict the DWG from using any integration time-step less than or equal to a \u00bc cycle in simulations when using positive sequence simulation tools.\nNo model in the DWG\u2019s Unacceptable Model List shall be used. Refer to Section 3.1.10.\nStandard Dynamic Models\nThe use of standard dynamic models provided by the software is preferred when they can accurately represent the dynamic performance of the device being modeled.\nUser-Written Dynamic Models\nA user written model is any model that is not a standard library model within the software(s) and version(s) listed in Section 3.1.1.  When no compatible standard dynamic model(s) provided within the software can be used to represent the dynamics of a device, accurate and appropriate user written models can be used, if accepted by ERCOT and the DWG after being tested for compatibility with the flat start cases.  A model guideline checksheet is provided by ERCOT for PSS/E, TSAT and PSCAD models to help determine compatibility ; this checksheet shall be completed and submitted along with the model.\nPSS/E User-written models for the dynamic equipment and associated data must be in dynamic linked library (DLL) format and must include a model manual.  The model manual must show control block diagrams, design logic, descriptions of all model parameters, a list of which parameters are commonly tuned for site-specific settings, and a description of procedures for using the model in dynamic simulations.\nTSAT User-written models for the dynamic equipment and associated data must be in TSAT User Defined Model (UDM) format and associated dynamic linked library (DLL) and template user-defined model (TUDM) if required. The TSAT UDM or DLL shall be able to directly read and support the PSS/E format data (.dyr file).  TSAT UDM models shall be provided with two cases:  one set up using bus numbers (the same numbers as a sample PSS/e case) and the other set up using equipment names.  The equipment name case should include a space character in the name to demonstrate that the model is compatible with space characters (an ERCOT systems requirement).\nAll PSCAD models are considered to be user-written models.\nDynamic Model Quality Test Guideline\nSubmitted dynamic planning and operations models must be accompanied with results from model quality tests (MQT) performed by the facility owner as required in paragraph (5)(c) of Planning Guide Section 6.2.  These results shall include the case simulation files as well as the simulation plots of relevant quantities for each test.  When submitting PSS/E and PSCAD MQT files, include the leading and lagging power factor cases for the voltage ride-through tests.  Guidelines on how these tests should be performed and the expected model performance are provided in the following sub-sections. All tests are required for PSS/E, TSAT, and PSCAD models with the exception of the Phase Angle Jump Test in Section 3.1.5.9, which is only required for PSCAD models.  A sample report is posted under \u2018Model Quality Guide\u2019 on the ERCOT Resource Entity webpage . Plots of PSS/E, TSAT, and PSCAD test results should be overlaid onto the same plot axis for comparison.  However, TSAT model testing is not required for models utilizing a TSAT standard library model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList of Applicable Tests\nApplicable Technologies\tModels\tTests and Sections\tNotes\nSynchronous Machines\n(incl. transmission-level synchronous condensers)\tPSS/e\n(and TSAT, and PSCAD if utilizing a UDM in PSS/e model)\t\tFlat-start, 3.1.5.2\nSmall volt. disturbance, 3.1.5.3\nLarge volt. disturbance, 3.1.5.6\nSmall frequency disturbance, 3.1.5.7\nIBRs, WGRs, and IBTEs\n(all non AGS-ESR)\n\n(Entities that own a generator Facility with a synchronous condenser would also run these tests.)\tPSS/e and PSCAD\n(and TSAT if utilizing a UDM PSS/e model)\t\tFlat-start, 3.1.5.2\nSmall volt. disturbance, 3.1.5.3\nSmall frequency disturbance, 3.1.5.7\nLarge voltage dist.:\nLVRT Test\u2020, 3.1.5.4\nHVRT Test\u2021, 3.1.5.5\nSystem Strength, 3.1.5.8\nPhase Angle Jump, 3.1.5.9\tPhase Angle Jump is only required in PSCAD (not in PSS/e and TSAT)\nAGS-ESR\n(Energy storage with Advanced Grid Support)\tPSS/e and PSCAD\n(and TSAT if utilizing a UDM PSS/e model)\t\tFlat-start, 3.1.5.2\nAGS Small volt. disturbance, 3.1.5.11\nAGS Frequency change and inertia response , 3.1.5.12\nLarge voltage dist.:\nLVRT Test\u2020, 3.1.5.4\nHVRT Test\u2021, 3.1.5.5\nAGS System Strength,3.1.5.13\nAGS Phase Angle Jump, 3.1.5.14\nAGS Loss of synchronous machine, 3.1.5.15\tAll tests, except Phase Angle Jump, are required in both PSS/e and PSCAD (and TSAT, if UDM).\n\u2020 Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRT): Includes both the Legacy LVRT and the Voltage Dip test fashioned after LVRT curve as defined in Nodal Operating Guide 2.9.1.1.\n\u2021 High Voltage Ride Through (HVRT): Includes the preferred HVRT curve and, if necessary, the Legacy HVRT curve. See Section 3.1.5.5 for more details.\n\n3.1.5.1 Simulation Set Up\n\nTo examine the dynamic performance of a Generation Facility or dynamic transmission element, all site-specific dynamic models needed to represent the facility shall be included in the test.  Unless otherwise specified, the following model guidelines apply:\nThe facility model is connected to a controllable infinite bus whose voltage and frequency can be adjusted for testing.  No explicit ERCOT transmission system models are required for this testing.  The tests shall be performed with the current planning model software.\nFor generation resources, the generator is dispatched at full real power output and the Point of Interconnection (POI) bus voltage is initialized to nominal 1.0 per-unit unless the test requires otherwise. Facilities that include energy storage systems should also be tested at full real power withdrawal. The initial reactive power exchange at the POI should be near zero unless the test requires otherwise.\nBehind the POI, the generator(s) and step-up transformer(s) shall be represented along with any additional planned or installed static and dynamic reactive equipment.\nStation transformer taps and static switched shunts should be initialized to a nominal position appropriate for the initial POI voltage and real power dispatch.\nAny switching controls that are expected to provide a response within 20 seconds (e.g. automatic switched shunts or on-load transformer tap changers) should be reflected in the dynamic model for the resource.\nAggregate Generation Resources, such as wind and solar, should be represented by a single equivalent aggregate model per registered Resource (i.e. allowed aggregation) and include a representation for the collector impedance and pad-mount transformer.  All dynamic control systems should be modeled (generator, exciter, governor, power system stabilizer, automatic voltage regulator, power plant controller, voltage and frequency protection, etc. as applicable).\nPSCAD models are not required to be aggregated to match resource registration.  However, PSS/E and TSAT models must match registration.\nSimulations should be run for a minimum of 20 seconds and show that the facility response has stabilized.\nExample test cases for an Inverter-Based Resource (IBR) with a STATCOM and a synchronous generator test case are shown below.\n\n\n\n3.1.5.2 Flat Start Test\nPerform a no-disturbance test of the prepared simulation case as described in Section 3.1.5.1 above for a minimum of 20 seconds.  Flat responses of voltage, MW, MVAR, and frequency, as shown in the figure below, are expected to remain very close to the initial system condition.\n\n3.1.5.3 Small Voltage Disturbance Test\nApply a 3% step increase, and in a separate simulation, a 3% step decrease of voltage at the POI.  The plant Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) and the associated droop and dead-band settings (if applicable) should transition the plant to/near maximum leading power factor , or in the latter case, to/near maximum lagging power factor in an attempt to regulate the original voltage set point.  Any oscillations should be well damped.  Real power output should be sustained throughout the small voltage disturbance tests.  The figures below include examples of acceptable and unacceptable responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5.4 Large Voltage Disturbance Test: (Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) for IBRs, WGRs, and IBTEs)\nAll IBRs, WGRs, and IBTEs should test two profiles, both a \u201clegacy\u201d profile and a \u201cvoltage dip\u201d profile as described below.  Testing both profiles helps provide important model performance information.\nThe \u201clegacy\u201d Low Voltage Ride Through curve per Nodal Operating Guide (NOG) 2.9.1.2.\nThe \u201cvoltage dip\u201d test includes evaluation of NOG 2.9.1.1.  The test shall be run as a series of separate piece-wise disturbances with the voltage returning to 1.0 per-unit (pu) voltage after each disturbance (see below examples).  The spacing between each disturbance may be greater than 10 seconds to allow for recovery as necessary.\nEach voltage disturbance profile starts at 1.0 pu voltage.  The \u201clegacy\u201d curve ends at 0.90 pu voltage.  In the case of Resources, tests shall be performed for two initial conditions: with the facility operating at a 0.95 lagging power factor (at the POI) and with the facility operating at 0.95 leading power factor (at the POI) . The model shall exhibit appropriate dynamic reactive response, active current injection, AVR response, and the model shall not exhibit momentary cessation.\nAdditionally, the maximized LVRT capability as required in NOG 2.9.1.1(8) or NOG 2.9.1.2(8) shall be documented in a format similar to the tables in NOG 2.9.1.1(1) or NOG 2.9.1.2(1).\n\nWhen testing the \u201clegacy\u201d profile, the following performance criteria apply:\nFor the low voltage transient, the model should inject reactive current throughout the voltage recovery period.  At the POI, both P and Q are necessarily zero during zero voltage. Q injection at the POI should be observable immediately or very shortly after voltage begins ramp up from zero.\nFor 0.9 pu sustained POI voltage, the AVR should provide voltage support that moves the resource towards nearly full reactive production (significantly lagging).\nReal power recovery should start prior to the POI voltage recovering to 0.9 pu.\nReal power should recover to full output within 1.0 seconds of POI voltage recovery to 0.9 pu.  A modest real power reduction  (typically 5% of Pmax or less) may be acceptable to accommodate greater terminal reactive power injection for sustained POI voltages in the range of 0.90 pu to 0.95 pu provided real power fully recovers when POI voltage returns to normal operating range (0.95-1.05 pu). An explanation, including a reference to any exempt status per ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide Section 2.9.1, , shall be provided for models which indicate that the unit trips or fails to meet any of the above performance criteria.\n\n\n\n\nWhen testing the \u201cvoltage dip\u201d profile, the following criteria applies:\nResources not subject to the \u201cpreferred\u201d Voltage Ride Through requirements of NOG 2.9.1.1 are only required to ride through the first dip of the below voltage dip profiles.  This first dip is within the \u201clegacy\u201d LVRT requirements of NOG 2.9.1.2.\nDuring the voltage dips:\nThe model shall inject active current for POI voltage dips of 0.5 and higher.\nInjections of significantly reduced active current for voltage dips 0.5 pu and 0.7 pu should be accompanied by increased reactive current.\nReactive current injection at the POI shall be observable immediately or very shortly after a non-zero voltage dip is applied.\nAfter the voltage dips:\nReal power should recover to full output within 1.0 seconds of POI voltage recovery to 1.0 pu.\nAn explanation, including a reference to any exempt status per ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide Section 2.9.1, shall be provided for models which indicate that the unit trips or fails to meet any of the above performance criteria.\n\nFollowing are three figures:  The first illustrates the \"Legacy\u201d LVRT to be applied at the POI; the second illustrates the \u201cvoltage dip\u201d LVRT voltage profile to be applied at the POI for photovoltaic generation resources (PVGRs) and energy storage resources (ESRs), and inverter-based transmission equipment, and the third illustrates the \u201cvoltage dip\u201d LVRT voltage profile to be applied at the POI for wind generation resources (WGRs).\n\n\n\nThe figures below include the examples of acceptable and unacceptable responses:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5.5 Large Voltage Disturbance Test (High Voltage Ride-Through for IBRs, WGRs, and IBTEs)\nFirst, apply the \u201cpreferred\u201d HVRT curve to the POI per NOG 2.9.1.  If the facility cannot meet the \u201cpreferred\u201d ride through requirements, then additionally test the \u201clegacy\u201d HVRT curve and report both results. The \u201cpreferred\u201d curve has more stringent requirements, so it is not necessary to test the \u201clegacy\u201d curve for devices passing the \u201cpreferred\u201d curve, and such testing would generally not provide additional revelations regarding model behavior.\nAdditionally, the maximized HVRT capability as required in NOG 2.9.1.1(8) or NOG 2.9.1.2(8) shall be documented in a format similar to the tables of NOG 2.9.1.1(1) and NOG 2.9.1.2(1).\n\nThe HVRT profiles start at 1.0 pu voltage and end at 1.1 pu.  The tests should be performed for two initial conditions: with the facility operating at 0.95 lagging power factor (at the POI) and with the facility operating at 0.95 leading power factor (at the POI). The model shall exhibit appropriate dynamic reactive response, active current injection, AVR response, and the model shall not exhibit momentary cessation.\nThe following criteria apply to both the \u201cpreferred\u201d and \u201clegacy\u201d HVRT tests:\nDuring the high voltage transient, the model should provide a fast dynamic response to absorb reactive power.  The resource should be absorbing a significant amount of reactive power at the POI during the high voltage transient, and ideally within 0.5 seconds of the transient inception.\nFor 1.1 pu sustained POI voltage, the AVR should move the resource towards nearly full reactive absorbing (significantly leading).\nReal power should be sustained during high voltage condition.  A modest real power reduction (typically 5% of Pmax or less) may be acceptable to accommodate  greater reactive power absorbed for sustained POI voltages in the range of 1.05 pu to 1.10 pu provided real power fully recovers when POI voltage returns to normal operating range (0.95-1.05 pu).\nAn explanation, including a reference to any exempt status per ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide Section 2.9.1, shall be provided for models which indicate that the unit trips or fails to meet any of the above performance criteria.\nThe following two figures illustrate the \u201cpreferred\u201d and the \u201clegacy\u201d HVRT voltage profiles applied at the POI.\n\n\n\nThe figures below include examples of acceptable and unacceptable responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5.6 Large Voltage Disturbance Test (for synchronous machines-based facilities including synchronous generators and synchronous condensers)\nApply a three-phase fault at the POI for 4 cycles (i.e. apply a step change to zero voltage at the POI for 4 cycles and then a step change back to nominal voltage).  The facility should inject reactive current during the fault.  Following the fault the facility should return to a stable operating point with full real power output.  Any oscillations should be well damped.\n\n3.1.5.7 Small Frequency Disturbance Test (all facilities)\nApply a 0.3 Hz step increase, and in a separate simulation, a 0.3 Hz step decrease of system frequency from nominal frequency (60Hz).  The governor or frequency controller should lower or raise the real power dispatch according to the droop and deadband characteristic.  A frequency response is required for all Generation Resources and Energy Storage Resources (ESRs) assuming there is sufficient headroom to respond to frequency changes.  The real power should initially be dispatched at 80% of maximum for this test. Tests for ESRs should also be run for a condition at 80% of maximum charging capability.  Since Intermittent Renewable Resources (IRRs) typically operate in a power availability state (no headroom) state even when operating below nameplate capability, two frequency drop simulations shall be performed for IRRs:  One where the resource is modeled in a curtailed (with headroom) state at 80% dispatch, and another simulation where the resource is modeled in a power availability state (no headroom) at 80% dispatch.  A description of how to set up the IRR model for each case (headroom vs. no headroom) should be included.  Non-exempt IRR resource models operating with headroom should provide a real power increase in response to a frequency drop.  An explanation, including a reference to any exempt status per ERCOT Nodal Protocol 8.5.1 shall be provided for models that fail to exhibit sufficient frequency response.  In general, the submitted IRR model should reflect a power availability state (no headroom state) as that would be the normal operating assumption even when dispatched at less than Pmax.\nThe figures below include the examples of acceptable and unacceptable responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5.8 System Strength Test (for Inverter-Based Resources, and Inverter-Based Transmission Elements)\nThis test considers the model performance under varying short circuit ratios (SCR).  The SCR of the electric grid can vary over time due to line contingencies, nearby generator status, etc., so it is important for a model to behave well under a range of SCR conditions.\nThe model shall be tested under at least four different short circuit ratios listed in the table below.  If there are concerns about model accuracy under certain lower short circuit ratios, a written explanation of the reason should be provided.\n\nTest\tSCR\n1\t5\n2\t3\n3\t1.5\n4\t1.2\n\nMethod for Testing SCR:\nA test case is set up where the plant model POI is connected to a controllable infinite bus by a branch whose impedance can be programmatically changed during the simulation.  Initially, the branch impedance is set to Xpu where Xpu represents the per-unit reactance necessary to achieve the desired short circuit ratio.  After applying a 4 cycle bolted three phase fault to the POI, the branch impedance is changed to reflect a post-disturbance system with higher impedance.    A series of short circuit ratios can be tested in the same simulation by progressively increasing the value of Xpu, so long as sufficient run time is provided between changes for the model to reach steady state.\n\n\n\nCalculation of Xpu, the Per-Unit Line Impedance:\nThe short circuit ratio is defined as the measured short circuit MVA (MVAfault) contribution from the system divided into the total generator MW capacity.  The measured short circuit MVA is defined as the short circuit current contribution from the system multiplied by the nominal system voltage.  Refer to the formula below, assuming a system base MVA of 100.\n\nSCR=\u3016MVA\u3017_Fault/\u3016MW\u3017_Capacity\n\nSCR=(100\u2044X_pu )/\u3016MW\u3017_Capacity\n\nRearranging,\nX_pu=100/(\u3016MW\u3017_Capacity*SCR)\n\nWhere\n\u3016MW\u3017_Capacity= Total MW capacity of generator(s) under study\nSCR\t= Desired short circuit ratio to test\nXpu \t= Per unit line reactance, on a 100 MVA system base\n\nExample:\nA wind farm consisting of one-hundred 2.0 MW wind turbines is to be tested under short circuit ratios of 5, 3, 1.5, and 1.2.  Thus, for the windfarm,\n\u3016MW\u3017_Capacity= 200 MW\n\nUsing the equation above, the line impedance (Xpu) is calculated for each of the test short circuit ratios.\nWhen testing SCR = 5, the line reactance is Xpu = 0.1\nWhen testing SCR = 3, the line reactance is Xpu = 0.17\nWhen testing SCR = 1.5, the line reactance is Xpu = 0.33\nWhen testing SCR = 1.2, the line reactance is Xpu = 0.42\n\nFor each increase in line reactance, the plant reactive power controller should adjust to restore voltage schedule and compensate for the increase in reactive losses. After applying the fault disturbance, the Xpu is modified to a value corresponding to the next lower SCR level to be tested.  Models shall provide acceptable responses for an SCR of 3 and higher.  If the responses are not acceptable for an SCR of 1.5, then a technical reason for the limitation should be provided, and a model enhancement should be considered.\nThe figures below include examples of acceptable and unacceptable responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5.9 Phase Angle Jump Test (for Inverter-Based Resources)\nThis test considers the model performance under a sudden increase or decrease in voltage phase angle as can sometimes occur on the electrical grid under disturbances.  The test consists of exposing the model to an instantaneous voltage phase angle increase, and separately, an instantaneous voltage phase angle decrease, to determine the maximum phase angle jump the model can withstand and still remain online and recover to normal operation.  For example, the test can be conducted starting with a 180 degree jump, and if the model cannot ride through, decreasing by 30 degrees each time until the model is able to ride through.  This test is only required for PSCAD models of inverter-based resources.\n\n3.1.5.10 Model Test Setup and Description for AGS-ESR\nThe following sections 3.1.5.11 \u2013 3.1.5.15 outline test procedures and associated criteria to examine and verify functionality for AGS-ESR. The flat start (defined in section 3.1.5.1) and large voltage disturbance tests (defined in Sections 3.1.5.4 and 3.1.5.5) are applicable to AGS-ESR, while Sections 3.1.5.11-3.1.5.15 contains modified and new tests specific to AGS-ESR: small voltage disturbance, frequency change and inertia response, system strength, and phase angle jump tests, as well as loss of synchronous machine test.\n\nAny quantities showing oscillations resulting from a test should demonstrate a controlled, damped response. Required plots for all tests include the relevant test profile, POI voltage, and the active/reactive power of the plant with appropriate axis resolution to demonstrate all performance criteria.\n\n3.1.5.11 AGS-ESR Small Voltage Disturbance Test\nIn this test, a step change is applied to the voltage magnitude of the controlled source so that the reactive power response time and magnitude can be measured. The purpose of this test is to demonstrate the capability of resisting changes in voltage magnitude. The test system should be set up to have zero impedance (Zth) between the ideal voltage source and the POI. The initial dispatch of the ESR should be set to its maximum discharging for active power, with approximately zero reactive power.  The figure below illustrates the voltage magnitude profile applied to an ideal source at the POI.\n\nThe following performance criteria apply:\nThe instantaneous reactive power output of the plant should quickly respond to oppose the voltage step change for each of the step changes, with an initial peak reactive power change of at least 0.03 pu on the rated power base (e.g., A 100 MVA rated plant with 0 MVAR initial output should instantaneously increase reactive power output from 0 MVAr to at least 3 MVAr when source voltage magnitude is decreased by 3%.).\n\nThe reactive power should not return to the pre-disturbance level within 6 cycles.\n\nThe response time to 90% of the initial change in instantaneous reactive power should occur within 1 cycle.\n\nAfter each step change resulting in POI voltage above or below the nominal value, the reactive power should start to transition toward the maximum reactive capability of the plant in an attempt to regulate the original voltage set point.\n\n\n\n3.1.5.12 AGS-ESR Frequency Change and Inertia Response Test\nThis test is to evaluate the active power response of the ESR and to estimate its inertia response to frequency change. The test system should be set up with a SCR of 3 at the connection point and with a X/R ratio of 6. The initial dispatch of ESR should be set to zero for active power with approximately zero reactive power\nThe figure below illustrates the frequency profile applied to the source at the POI, with initial ramps of 1 Hz/s followed by 0.3 Hz steps which is the same test for the existing IBRs.\n\nThe following performance criteria apply:\nPlant real and reactive power output should be well controlled. The frequency and voltage should not oscillate excessively or deviate from steady-state levels for any significant amount of time.\n\nVoltage should settle to a stable operating point when the frequency is not ramping\n\nThe equivalent inertia constant, as calculated below, should be greater than 2.5 s.\n\nH \u2248 60 * \u2206E [s], where: \u2206E is the area under the per unit active power production of the ESR from 0 to 0.5 s, when the RoCoF is 1 Hz/s.\n\nActive power should settle according to its frequency droop and deadband settings when the frequency has settled.\n\n\n\n3.1.5.13 AGS-ESR System Strength Test\nThis test is similar to the existing system strength test for all IBRs, but AGS-ESR shall demonstrate a stable response for all tested SCR values from 10 down to 1.2. The test system should be set up with a SCR of 10 at the connection point with a X/R ratio of 6. The initial dispatch of ESR should be set to the max discharging for active power with approximately zero reactive power.\n\nThe model shall be tested under the short circuit ratios listed in the table below.  As in the case of non-AGS-ESR, a 3-phase, bolted, 4-cycle fault is applied just before each SCR transition. The SCR transition occurs at fault clearing time.\nTest\tSCR\n1\t10\n2\t5\n3\t3\n4\t1.5\n5\t1.2\n\n\n\n\nThe following performance criteria apply:\nPlant real and reactive power output and RMS voltage should be well controlled\n\nThe plant shall not trip nor reduce power (outside of the fault period) for any extended period of time for all tested SCR range from 10 to 1.2.\n\n\n\n3.1.5.14 AGS-ESR Phase Angle Jump Test\nThis test examines the capability to maintain the voltage phasor and ability to resist an angle change. In addition, it ensures stable behavior under different angle step changes when an ESR is working close to its maximum current limit. For large angle changes forcing the controls beyond their maximum current limits, the ESR should be stable and should not degrade the performance of the power grid. The test system should have a SCR of 3 at the connection point with a X/R ratio of 6. Initial dispatch of ESR should be set to the max discharging for active power with approximately zero reactive power. This phase angle jump test must be conducted using PSCAD.\n\nThe figure below illustrates the voltage angle profile applied at the 3-phase ideal voltage source.\n\n\nThe following performance criteria apply:\nThe instantaneous active power output of the plant should quickly respond to oppose the angle change with the peak active power change being at least 0.2 pu (based on the rated active power) for each 10-degree voltage phase angle change, in the opposing direction. (e.g., A 100 MW rated plant should temporarily decrease active power output from 100 MW to 80 MW, or below, when source voltage angle is increasing 10 degrees; and it should temporarily increase active power from 100 to at least 120 MW, if the current limit allows, when voltage source angle is decreased by 10 degrees.).\n\nFor the 25-degree voltage phase angle change, the instantaneous active power output of the plant should quickly respond to oppose the angle change with the peak active power change being at least 0.5 pu (based on the rated active power) in the opposing direction. If the criterion is not met for the 25-degree angle change, the rationale should be documented.\n\nThe active power should not return to the pre-disturbance level for at least 3 cycles.\n\nThe response time to 90% of the initial change in instantaneous active power should occur within one cycle.\n\nIf the current limit in the inverter is reached when the angle jump is applied, the performance criteria described above may not apply. However, the active power must return to the pre-disturbance level in a stable manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5.15 AGS-ESR Loss of Synchronous Machine Test\nThe purpose of this test is to confirm the ability of an AGS-ESR to form voltage and work in parallel with a nearby AGS-ESR. It is not intended to examine the black start capability of AGS-ESR nor to require ESRs operate continuously on a grid without synchronous resources.\nThis test utilizes a duplicate of the AGS-ESR under test to represent the neighboring plant. The synchronous source can be represented by a voltage source or any source with sufficiently high inertia and low impedance compared to the AGS-ESR under study.\nUsing the testbench shown in the figure below, with a constant impedance load (L) and a power factor of 0.95 lag, along with the project plant initial dispatch (P1), the duplicated plant initial dispatch (P2), and the load value, the following three scenarios must be tested:\nScenario 1:\nP1 = 0.3 pu discharging, P2 = 0.1 pu discharging, and L = 1.3 pu\nScenario 2:\nP1 = 0.6 pu charging, P2 = 0.4 pu charging, and L = 0.7 pu\nScenario 3:\nP1 = 0, P2 = 1 pu discharging, and L = 1.65 pu\nNote: The dispatch and load values are provided based on the project plant rating.\n\nSimulate the system until a stable response is reached for the given scenario, ensuring that no oscillations occur, then disconnect the voltage source (without fault) and continue the simulation for at least 10 seconds. Plots of the active and reactive power of the ESR, duplicate ESR, load, and voltage source as well as POI frequency should be provided.\n\n\n\nThe following performance criteria apply:\nImmediately following the disconnection of voltage source, both AGS-ESRs output should be well controlled and exhibit stable response.\n\nSystem frequency and voltage should settle to a stable operating point (within 5 seconds) and be completely damped within 10 seconds.\n\nActive and reactive power from each plant should move immediately to meet the load requirement, while response time to 90% of initial change should occur within one cycle.\n\nActive and reactive power from each plant should settle according to its droop setting.\n\n\n3.1.6 Unit Model Validation\nPSCAD models must be accompanied with results from the unit model validation tests performed by the Interconnecting Entity or Resource Entity as required in paragraph (5)(d) of Planning Guide Section 6.2.  These validations shall demonstrate the accuracy of the PSCAD models against actual inverter testing and should be performed for all inverter-based device types within the facility.  The test report should clarify if the inverter is capable of meeting AGS-ESR requirements and that these control settings are enabled. The tests are inverter specific but need not be site-specific.  The report should include a description of the test set up as well as the simulation plots of relevant quantities for each test.   Guidelines on how these tests should be performed and the expected model performance are provided in the following sub-sections.\n\n\n3.1.6.1 PSCAD Model Setup\n\nBecause the purpose of validation is to test the PSCAD inverter model, it is not necessary to model any balance-of-plant equipment, transformers, collector system, power plant controllers, etc., however any auxiliary inverter-based equipment should also be tested (for example, STATCOMs). In simulation software, the PSCAD model(s) should be connected to a controllable voltage source whose voltage and frequency can be adjusted for testing. The inverter should be dispatched at full real power unless the test requires otherwise.  Energy storage devices should be tested under both charging and discharging modes.  Simulations should be run for a minimum of 10 seconds.\n\n3.1.6.2 Inverter Hardware Testbench Setup\n\nThe testbench should utilize actual inverter hardware programmed with typical default settings.  Thus the test should be representative for all inverter devices under the same hardware and control implementation.\n\n\n3.1.6.3 Testing\n\nThe tests are designed to measure the inverter and model response to small and large magnitude disturbances of frequency and voltage as well as the subsynchronous response to gauge model accuracy.  Many of the tests closely parallel those used in the Model Quality Guideline Section 3.1.5.  Alternative testing methods may be permissible if the objective is fulfilled.  The following tests should be performed on both the PSCAD model and the actual inverter hardware:\n\nStep change in voltage, as specified in Section 3.1.5.3\nVoltage Ride Through, as specified in Section 3.1.5.4 and 3.1.5.5.\nSystem Strength Test similar to Section 3.1.5.9.\nVoltage Angle Step Test as in Section 3.1.5.10.\nSubsynchronous Test:  Perform a frequency scan sweep to measure the subsynchronous impedance as seen looking into the inverter over the range 5 to 55 Hz in 1 Hz increments.  This test is generally conducted by adding a small voltage perturbation of variable frequency superimposed on the fundamental (60 Hz) voltage, and measuring the complex impedance as seen looking into the inverter.  The results should be provided both as a plot and as a table and should display Resistance and Reactance plotted over 5 to 55 Hz.  Values should be in per-unit on the inverter MVA base.  This test should be conducted under the following conditions:  Strong system (short circuit ratio = 10), unity power factor, Weak System Lagging (short circuit ratio = 1.5, 0.95 lagging power factor), and Weak System Leading (short circuit ratio = 1.5, 0.95 leading power factor).\n\n\nMaintenance of Dynamic Models\nMaintenance of the models is the responsibility of the device owner. Models shall be maintained in accordance with Section 3.2.  Any user-written dynamic models shall also be maintained to fulfill the requirements as described in the Planning Guide Section 6.2 and Section 3.1.4 in this manual.\nDynamic Data for Existing Equipment\n\u201cAs-built\u201d data is required for all completed facilities in accordance with Section 3.2.  To help ensure that dynamic model data is kept up to date with site-specific settings, paragraph (5)(b) of Planning Guide Section 6.2 introduces a \u201cplant verification\u201d requirement.  The plant verification reports should confirm that the model correctly reflects site-specific settings by presenting evidence such as delivery and testing reports, screenshots or pictures of actual hardware settings, attestations from the equipment manufacturer, etc.\nDynamic Data for Planned Equipment\nThe development of future year case data may require an entity to submit the best available information for the planned equipment prior to development of a detailed design. In such cases, estimated or typical manufacturer\u2019s dynamic data, based on units of similar design and characteristics, may be submitted. However, the Resource Entity shall update the model information upon completion of the detailed design and again upon commissioning the equipment. Dynamic data for planned equipment shall be submitted in accordance with Planning Guide Section 6.2 and Section 3.2 in this manual.\nUnacceptable Dynamic Models\nThe DWG adopted a list of unacceptable dynamic models developed by the NERC System Analysis and Modeling Subcommittee (SAMS) with exception of those models for which DWG has a technical justification not to adopt.\nUnacceptable models that already exist in the ERCOT dynamic dataset shall be phased out through dynamic model updates including updates received via the NERC MOD-026-1 and MOD-027-1 processes.\nIf a generation interconnection or dynamic model update has begun prior to a model being identified as unacceptable by NERC, the model may be allowed.\nThe list of acceptable/unacceptable dynamic models are published on the NERC website.\n\nDynamic Data for Equipment Owned by Resource Entities (REs)\nDynamic Data Requirements for New Equipment\nNote: This section addresses the requirements stated in R1 of NERC Standard MOD-032-1 (effective July 1, 2015).\nREs are responsible for providing models with model parameters resulting in a tuned model that represents the dynamic performance of the device. Final responsibility for the submission and the accuracy of the dynamic data lies on the RE. ERCOT and the DWG will provide voluntary assistance if requested by REs to complete parameter tuning and prepare model records. The DWG member representing the TSP to which the RE is connected is responsible for working with ERCOT to incorporate the dynamic data received from the RE into the DWG Flat Start cases (.dyr file) during annual updates.\nThe RE shall fulfill its interconnection data requirement by including acceptable dynamic data and models for their facilities.  The RE may have additional model and data reporting obligations to ensure compliance with NERC reliability standards and/or other requirements.\nThe following two subsections describe data requirements for two distinct categories of generation facilities:\nSynchronous Generation Facilities:\nThe model data shall include, at minimum, a generator model, a governor model, an exciter model, and if applicable, a power system stabilizer model and an excitation limiter model.\nExplicit frequency protection relay models shall be provided for all generators where relays are set to trip the generating unit within the \u201cno trip zone\u201d of NERC Standard PRC-024 Attachment 1.\nExplicit voltage protection relay models shall be provided for all generators where relays are set to trip the generating unit within the \u201cno trip zone\u201d of NERC Standard PRC-024 Attachment 2.\nA governor model is not required for the steam turbine(s) of combined cycle plants.\nIBRs, and WGRs:\nThe RE shall provide the following data as applicable to the generator technology:\nModel, data and description of voltage control method.\nModel, data and description of how they will meet ERCOT reactive requirements.\nA one-line diagram of the proposed facility.\nData for all transformers.

For dynamic reactive devices, provide the appropriate model and data.\nLine data from the POI to each generator shall include:\nLine type (overhead or underground)\nLine length\nLine resistance in ohms/1000 ft\nLine reactance in ohms/1000 ft\nLine susceptance in mhos/1000 ft\nWind turbine models shall account for rotor mass, aerodynamic energy conversion, and pitch control.\nExplicit frequency protection relay models shall be provided for all facilities where relays are set to trip the resource within the \u201cno trip zone\u201d of NERC Standard PRC-024 Attachment 1.\nExplicit voltage protection relay models shall be provided for all facilities where relays are set to trip the resource within the \u201cno trip zone\u201d of NERC Standard PRC-024 Attachment 2.\n\nUpdates to Existing Dynamic Data\nThe RE shall submit dynamic model updates to ERCOT and the TSP to which they are connected within 30 days of any facility change and/or test result that necessitates a model update to accurately reflect dynamic performance.  The data requirements specified in section 3.2.1 for new equipment also apply to all submitted model updates.  Obsolete data should be deleted or commented out as appropriate in the dynamic data.\nData for Load Resource\nERCOT will prepare the dynamic model using a standard model for Load Resource that is qualified to provide Responsive Reserve (RRS) through under frequency relay models.  Data for the Load Resource model shall be documented in the Stability Book.\nDynamic Data for Equipment Owned by Transmission Service Providers (TSPs) or Other Equipment Owners\nUnder Frequency Firm Load Shedding (UFLS) Relay Data\nUFLS data shall be prepared annually in accordance with ERCOT and NERC standards. TSPs are responsible for preparing the UFLS relay model records for their respective loads.  The TSP shall submit the UFLS relay data to ERCOT in the form of a data file using an appropriate model compatible with the software listed in Section 3.1.1. The models should contain the necessary information to properly represent the UFLS relay actions in a dynamic study, including:\nLocation (bus number and/or load ID) of load to be interrupted.\nFraction of load to be interrupted.\nCorresponding frequency set points.\nOverall scheme clearing times (including all time delays, breaker clearing times, etc.)\nAlso, the TSP should indicate any other schemes that are part of or impact the UFLS programs such as related generation protection, islanding schemes, automatic load restoration schemes, automatic capacitor/reactor switching, and Remedial Action Scheme (RAS).\nAll UFLS data will be documented in the annual Stability Book.\nUnder Voltage Load Shedding (UVLS) Relay Data\nAn ERCOT TSP which has UVLS relays in its service area designed to mitigate under voltage conditions potentially impacting the system reliability is to establish and maintain a UVLS Program consistent with NERC Standards.\nThe TSP owning an UVLS Program will submit the corresponding relay model to ERCOT during the annual Stability Book update. The DWG member shall submit the UVLS relay data in the form of a data file using an appropriate model compatible with the software listed in Section 3.1.1.\nIt is the responsibility of the TSP to ensure the UVLS program model submitted has been tested through an assessment as per NERC standards.\nAlso, the TSP shall indicate any other schemes that are part of or impact the UVLS programs such as related generation protection, islanding schemes, automatic load restoration schemes, automatic capacitor/reactor switching, and RASs.\nThe model shall contain the necessary information to properly represent the under voltage relay actions in a dynamic study, including:\nLocation (bus number and/or load ID) of load to be interrupted.\nFraction of load to be interrupted.\nCorresponding voltage set points.\nOverall scheme clearing times (including all time delays, breaker clearing times, etc.).\nAll UVLS data from the responsible entities will be documented in the annual Stability Book.\nProtective Relay Data\nThe operation of protection, control, and RAS systems can affect the dynamic performance of the ERCOT system during and following contingencies. Planning, documenting, maintaining, or other activities associated with these systems is outside the scope of the DWG. However, because they can affect dynamic performance, the DWG should, on an as needed basis, identify and document protection, control, and RAS systems for inclusion to its dynamic data sets.  Identification of these protection systems will normally require the assistance of individuals or groups outside the DWG. The specific information to be considered for inclusion will depend on the type, purpose, and scope of study.\nProtection, control, and RAS systems included in the DWG dynamic data should be in the form of a dynamic model and shall be compatible with the software listed in Section 3.1.1.  Protection, control, and RAS systems adequately modeled for dynamic purposes by other working groups only need to be referenced in the DWG study reports.\nThe DWG member, as part of the annual dynamic data update, shall review and update as necessary protection, control, and RAS systems already in the DWG database.  This review should include evaluating the existing data for applicability and accuracy.\nProtective relay data included in a DWG flat start case shall be documented in the Stability Book.\nLoad Model Data\nNote: This section addresses the requirements stated in R1 of NERC Standard MOD 032-1 and R2.4.1 of NERC Standard TPL-001-4 and TPL-001-5.1 (effective July 1, 2023).\nAnother key component of any dynamic study is the load model and its representation as a function of changing frequency or voltage.  The load model can have a significant effect on results of dynamic analysis.  For this reason, it is important to use an appropriate load model during the study.\nThe DWG shall review and update static load models for each area, composed of a mix of constant impedance (Z), constant current (I), and constant power (P) representations, known as ZIP models.  PSS/E CONL activity is used to incorporate the ZIP models into a PSS/E study.\nThe DWG recommends the use of the CMLD composite load model to represent various typical dynamic load elements, and in particular, modeling of air conditioning load as needed for studies.  Due to the complexity of flat start case development, these dynamic load models are not included in the DWG flat start cases. Instead, the dynamic load models are documented in the Stability Book.\nWithin 30 days of a written request from ERCOT, a TSP shall provide dynamic load models compatible with the software listed in Section 3.1.1 with documentation explaining the process to derive such models.\nThe DWG shall review the standard load-frequency dependency model (LDFRAL) and update the model if necessary. The model shall be documented in the Stability Book.\nOther Types of Dynamic Data\nNote: This section addresses requirements stated in R1 of NERC Standard MOD 032-1 (effective July 1, 2015).\nAll elements with dynamic response capabilities (such as SVC, STATCOM, Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES), DC tie, fast switchable shunts, and Variable-Frequency Transformer) that are in service and/or modeled in the SSWG base cases shall be represented with an appropriate dynamic model compatible with the software listed in Section 3.1.1.\nThe DWG member of the TSP owning the equipment shall submit the model to ERCOT during the annual dynamic database update or as needed for studies. If the equipment owner is not a TSP (e.g. DC tie owners), appropriate models shall be submitted to ERCOT and the TSP to which the equipment is connected within 30 days of any facility change and/or test result that necessitates a model update to accurately reflect dynamic performance.\nMissing or Problematic Dynamics Data\nThe DWG is responsible for reviewing the dynamic data on an annual basis and reporting to the ROS any missing data or unresolved issues relating to data submission requirements.  DWG will report select data problems to the respective ERCOT working group per Section 4.2.3.\nIf the DWG and/or ERCOT identifies inappropriate or incomplete dynamic data, the appropriate DWG member and/or ERCOT shall request that the equipment owner resolves the discrepancies by following processes established by existing NERC Standards or ERCOT requirements. The final responsibility for the submission and the accuracy of the data lies with the equipment owner. All of the data and the revisions requested by ERCOT shall be resolved by the entity owning the equipment within 30 days.  Until valid data becomes available, ERCOT or the DWG member to whose system the equipment is connected shall recommend an interim solution to the missing or problematic data.\nDynamic Data and Stability Book Storage\nERCOT shall make available to the DWG members in electronic format the dynamic data described in this document.  ERCOT shall maintain a repository of dynamic data approved by the DWG and will maintain the submitted revisions."

If the RE is not required to provide a model and/or an adequate model is not available to DWG, the DER_A model will be used. Parameterization will be based on DWG approved parameters in the ERCOT DWG DG Parameterization Guideline for the DER_A model and will represent capabilities consistent with the DGR/DESR requirements in the ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide.\nRE provided models will be used to represent synchronous DGRs. If the RE is not required to provide a model and/or an adequate model is not available to DWG, a generic model with DWG approved parameters in the ERCOT DWG DG Parameterization Guideline will be used with capabilities consistent with the DGR requirements in the ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide.\n3.5.2 Settlement Only Distribution Generator (SODG)\nRE provided models will be used to represent inverter-based SODGs with nameplate capacity of 5 MW or greater. If the RE is not required to provide a model and/or an adequate model is not available to DWG, the DER_A model with DWG approved parameters in the ERCOT DWG DG Parameterization Guideline will be used.\nRE provided models will be used to represent synchronous SODGs with nameplate capacity of 5 MW or greater. If the RE is not required to provide a model and/or an adequate model is not available to DWG, a generic model with DWG approved parameters in the ERCOT DWG DG Parameterization Guideline will be used.\nSODGs less than 5 MW will be represented as negative load (with GNET) in DWG base cases.\n3.5.3 Unregistered Distributed Generation (UDG)\nUDG dynamics will not be explicitly represented in DWG base cases.  DWG will not modify UDG representation from the SSWG  case - UDG will be embedded or reflected in the load according to current TSP conventions.\n\n\nOverview of DWG Activities\nUpdating Dynamic Data and Flat Starts\nSchedule for Dynamic Data Updates and Flat Start Cases\nNote: This section addresses requirements stated in R2 of NERC Standards TPL-001-4 and TPL-001-5.1 (effective July 1, 2023).\n\nEach June, the DWG shall prepare a detailed schedule for developing flat start cases and providing associated dynamic contingencies.  The DWG shall begin the flat start case development process as soon as practicable after SSWG base cases are posted \u2013 normally in May.  The DWG shall prepare flat start cases for near term on-peak, near term off-peak and long-term on-peak conditions to facilitate planning assessments required by NERC Standard TPL-001-4 and TPL-001-5.1 (effective July 1, 2023).  It is intended that the three dynamic data sets be developed concurrently to be utilized in planning assessments for the next year (YR+1).  The following diagram presents a schedule as a reference for DWG flat start case development:\nYR (YR=Current Year)\tYR + 1\nApr\tMay\tJun\tJul\tAug\tSep\tOct\tNov\tDec\tJan\tFeb\tMar\nYR SSWG Build Process\n- Cases Posted\nPrepare DWG Flat Start Schedule\tDWG Dynamic Flat Start Case Development\nNear Term On-Peak Case\nNear Term Off-Peak Case\nLong Term On-Peak Case\nFinal DWG Data Sets Posted\nSubmit Dynamic Contingency Files and  Dynamic Load Models\nStability Book Finalized and Posted\n\nThe DWG flat start case development process adds detailed dynamic models to network elements represented in an SSWG base case that reflect behavior during and following system disturbances.  The DWG shall normally prepare dynamic flat start cases based on the following SSWG steady state cases:\nNear-Term On-Peak Case: (Y+3) SUM1\nNear-Term Off-Peak Case: (Y+4) HRML\nLong-Term On-Peak Case: (Y+7) SUM1\nFor example, the following flat start cases would be developed during the period from July 2023 through January 2024: 2026 SUM1, 2027 HRML, and 2030 SUM1.  These cases could then be used for planning assessments performed in 2024.  The DWG may choose to develop dynamic flat start data sets for alternative cases that meet the same objectives with respect to facilitating the completion of NERC TPL planning assessments.\nAfter January 1st, 2015, ERCOT shall serve as the flat start coordinator for all DWG flat start cases.\nDynamic Data Updates\nEach DWG member shall review the dynamic data from the prior year for its portion of the ERCOT System and provide necessary updates according to the schedule established in section 4.1.1. The changes in the data must be identified and submitted with the updated data.\nData for mothballed units shall be retained. Obsolete data should be deleted or commented.\nOther revisions of data that should be submitted to the flat start coordinator include updates to the load model, Zsource corrections, generation netting, or any other modifications to the network necessary for dynamic studies.\nDynamic Data Screening\nThe DWG members should review the dynamic data for equipment connected to their system for completeness and applicability.  The data should be appropriate for the model, and the model should be appropriate for the equipment.  Before submitting data for inclusion in updated dynamic base cases, each DWG member should perform dynamic data screening.\nFlat Start Criteria\nDWG Flat Start cases shall:\nInitialize with no errors;\nDemonstrate that simulation output channels for frequency, voltage and power do not deviate from an acceptable range for a Twenty-second run with no disturbance.\nThe product of a successful flat start will be a planning model software simulation-ready base case (the unconverted base case) with its associated dynamic data files including user models (.dyr, .obj, .lib, and .dll files), stability data change documentation, python (.py) files and response files (.idv) files.  The product of a successful flat start also includes the steps taken to build the flat start case such as network model changes (i.e. changing the schedule of the North DC, tuning voltages, etc.).\nPost Flat Start Activities\nDistribution of Flat Start Results and the Dynamic Data Base\nUpon completion of each flat start, all dynamic data and final data files shall be posted on the ERCOT MIS so that it is accessible to all DWG members and to ERCOT.  This posting shall be within the schedule established by the DWG for the given flat start.\nStability Book\nThe Stability Book is an annual document used to record dynamic data changes and/or corrections required during the flat start processes.  The flat start coordinator shall prepare the annual stability book.  Recommendations to revise load flow data are also included in the book.  DWG Members are required to communicate these recommendations to other respective working groups, including Steady State Working Group, Operations Working Group, and Network Data Support Working Group, to eliminate recurring problems.\nThe following information is included in Stability Book:\nDeviation tables or plots of the flat start results are included to verify the successful completion of the flat start process.\nDynamic data.  This data is in the DOCU ALL PSS/E activity format.\nUnder frequency and under voltage load shedding relay data submitted by each of the appropriate DWG members.\nAdditional information identified for inclusion by Section 3.4\nDWG Coordination with the Steady State Working Group\nTo support coordination with the Steady State Working Group, Operations Working Group, and Network Data Support Working Group a list of changes made to the following steady-state power flow data shall be reported to the ERCOT Steady State Working Group representative:\nUnit MVA Base: this is also known as MBASE and is used as the base quantity for many dynamic model parameters associated with generating units.\nZsource: reactive machine impedance that is required to match the subtransient reactance specified in the dynamic generator model for proper initialization of dynamic simulations.\nERCOT shall compile the list of data changes following finalization of the flat start DWG shall coordinate with SSWG to assure that conflicting data is corrected during future SSWG case building activities.\nDWG Dynamic Contingency Assumptions List\nThe DWG shall construct a dynamic contingency assumptions list detailing contingency assumptions for each TSP for the purpose of screening studies conducted by ERCOT and the DWG members. ERCOT and the DWG members shall annually review and update the dynamic contingency assumption list. Upon completion of the annual review, ERCOT shall collect the contingency assumptions and submit the finalized dynamic contingency assumptions list to the DWG.\n\nThe assumptions shall include:\nBreaker trip time for normal clearing,\nBreaker trip time for delayed clearing due to stuck breaker\nBreaker trip time for delayed clearing due to relay failure\nRelay characteristic assumptions to assess generic apparent impedance swings that can trip any transmission system elements\nOther assumptions deemed necessary by DWG as specified during the annual review\nDWG Dynamic Contingency Database\nThe DWG shall prepare a Dynamic Contingency Database according to a standard spreadsheet format.  The spreadsheet format will be reviewed annually. In addition to the spreadsheet, DWG members can also provide their contingencies in python format if the spreadsheet is inadequate to accurately represent the contingencies (ex. contingencies based on detailed expansion of the station into node breaker). The dynamic contingency database and any additional contingencies provided in python will be posted on the ERCOT Market Information System (MIS) so that it is accessible to all DWG members and to ERCOT.\nOther DWG Activities\nEvent Simulation\nERCOT will compare dynamic system model performance to that of actual system response data in accordance with NERC MOD-033.  For a selected event, the affected TSP will provide actual measured system behavior data (or a written response that it does not have the requested data) to ERCOT within 30 calendar days of a written request.\nProcedure Manual Revision Guidelines\nThe DWG is responsible for maintaining and updating this Procedure Manual.  Revisions, additions and/or deletions to this Procedure Manual may be undertaken at such times that the DWG feels it is necessary due to changes in dynamic simulation software or to meet new and/or revised requirements of NERC, ERCOT, or any other organization having oversight or regulatory authority.\nAt least annually, the DWG chair shall request a thorough review of the current Procedure Manual for any needed revisions.  The notification will request that proposed revisions be submitted to the DWG chair (or the chair\u2019s designate) for consolidation and distribution to all DWG members for comment and/or additional revision.\nThe DWG chair may seek approval of any revision, addition, or deletion to the Procedure Manual in the regular DWG meetings, or called special meeting as deemed necessary or requested by DWG membership.\nAll proposed Procedure Manual revisions shall be submitted to ROS for approval.  After ROS approval, the Procedure Manual will be publicly posted on the DWG webpage: https://www.ercot.com/committees/ros/dwg.\nRecommended DWG Study Methodologies\nNote: This section addresses, in part, requirements R4, R5 and R6 of NERC Standard TPL-001-4 and TPL-001-5.1 (effective July 1, 2023).\nVoltage stability margin, transient voltage criteria, and damping criteria are described in the ERCOT Planning Guide Section 4.\nVoltage Instability Identification in Stability Studies\nVoltage Instability is indicated by severely low bus voltage or bus voltage collapse.\nVoltage Instability could cause:\nMotor stalling leading to significant amount of customer initiated motor tripping.\nLoss of generator(s) due to low voltage\nVoltage collapse of an area\nCascading Identification in Stability Studies\nCascading Definition - Cascading is defined as the uncontrolled loss of any system facilities or load, whether because of thermal overload, voltage collapse, or loss of synchronism, except those occurring as a result of fault isolation. Cascading is indicated by one or more of the following conditions:\nUncontrolled sequential loss of generators\nUncontrolled sequential loss of load\nUncontrolled sequential loss of branches.\nCascading could cause conditions like:\nVoltage collapse of an area\nExpanding number of buses with voltage instability\nSystem islanding, frequency instability due to power-load unbalance\nNERC Definition: The uncontrolled successive loss of system elements triggered by an incident at any location. Cascading results in widespread electric service interruption that cannot be restrained from sequentially spreading beyond an area predetermined by studies.\nUncontrolled Islanding Identification in Stability Studies\nUncontrolled islanding is the separation and loss of synchronism between a portion of the interconnection and the remaining interconnected system.  Islanding originates with uncontrolled loss of branches, ending with the formation of sub-network islands.\nGenerators disconnected from the System by fault clearing action or by a RAS are not considered out of synchronism.  Similarly, islands formed from being disconnected from the System by fault clearing action or by a RAS are not considered an uncontrolled island.\nSub-network islands have the following characteristics:\nThe sub-network islands have both generation and load to support the continuation of the island.\nThe sub-networks formed are not connected to each other.\nUncontrolled islanding in a screening study could cause:\nOut-of-step generators\nOff-nominal frequency disturbances\nEventual collapse of an island due to frequency or voltage instabilities caused by the generation-load unbalance in the sub-network island.\nGenerator Protection Assumptions\nNote: This section addresses, in part, requirements R3.3.1.1 and R4.3.1.2 of NERC Standard TPL-001-4 and TPL-001-5.1 (effective July 1, 2023).\n\nIf dynamic models are not provided for Generator protection schemes, generic generator protection may be assumed for screening purposes\nFor synchronous generators, a rotor angle swing greater than 180 degrees may be considered an unstable generator.\nGenerators may be assumed to be compliant with the minimum requirements of Section 2.9 Voltage Ride-Through Requirements for Generation Resources of the ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide.\nGenerators may be assumed to be compliant with the minimum requirements of Section 2.6 Requirements for Under/Over-Frequency Relaying of the ERCOT Nodal Operating Guide."
