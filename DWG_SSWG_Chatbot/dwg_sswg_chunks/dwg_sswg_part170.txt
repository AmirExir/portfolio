Technical Rationale for Less limiting Facilities 
 
ERCOT and TSPs shall model Facility Ratings and System steady-state voltage limits (voltage-based Facility Ratings) that are equally limiting or more limiting than operational Facility Ratings and voltage limits developed in accordance with the ERCOT System Operating Limit (SOL) Methodology for the Operations Time Horizon, as represented in the MOD Base Case. Facility Ratings and voltage limits include, but are not limited to, bus voltage limits, transformer ratings, line ratings, breaker ratings, and switch ratings.

ERCOT or TSPs must provide one of the following technical rationale to model less limiting Facility Ratings or voltage limits in the SSWG Cases:

•	Transmission Project, for planned transmission projects that would modify transmission facilities. This category generally a
