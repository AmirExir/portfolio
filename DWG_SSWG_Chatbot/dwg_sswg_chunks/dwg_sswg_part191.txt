ng power factor in an attempt to regulate the original voltage set point.  Any oscillations should be well damped.  Real power output should be sustained throughout the small voltage disturbance tests.  The figures below include examples of acceptable and unacceptable responses.  
 

 
 
 

3.1.5.4 Large Voltage Disturbance Test: (Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) for IBRs, WGRs, and IBTEs)
All IBRs, WGRs, and IBTEs should test two profiles, both a “legacy” profile and a “voltage dip” profile as described below.  Testing both profiles helps provide important model performance information.
	The “legacy” Low Voltage Ride Through curve per Nodal Operating Guide (NOG) 2.9.1.2.
	The “voltage dip” test includes evaluation of NOG 2.9.1.1.  The test shall be run as a series of separate piece-wise disturbances with the voltage returning to 1.0 per-unit (pu) voltage after each disturbance (see below examples).  The spacing between each disturbance may be greater than 10 seconds to allow for recove
