se instances, the most accurate model is the switched shunt modeled at a dummy bus connected by a zero impedance branch to the real station bus.  This dummy bus must have exactly two branches connected to it, both of which must be members of the same multi-section line grouping.  The status of the line section is that the multi-section line is treated as a single element.  A shunt capacitor or reactor connected to a line but modeled as a shunt within a station will result in power-flow calculations for contingencies that differ from real operating conditions.

4.6.2	Series Devices
Series capacitors and reactors will be modeled as a series branch with the appropriate impedance. If a parallel bypass exists, it should be modeled as a zero impedance branch with the appropriate branch status indicating whether it is normally open or normally closed.
