I keep the unit within its limit I let them know about my max unit capability so he can only picks up loads up to 5% of my 20mw unit which is 1 mw at a time or my unit would trip. one day two, i filled in for TLCRA i continued picking up loads till i made it to the next start unit at Ferguson, I told QLCRA to take the black start unit off the isochronous mode closed the breaker when the angles and voltages were right and synched up my black start unit and next start unit and put them on Automatic generation mode. I continued picking up loads at more speed as I could pick up up to 5% of total capacity of my generators on AGC. I continiued following black start plan and made parallel ways to stabalize my island, I¬† tried to synch with the neighboring islands such as centerpoint, Austin Energy, AEP, STEC to have more stable island. I help Centerpoint to have more stable island so they can deliver shut down power to the STP nuclear unit quicker which should be within 8 hours. one day 3 I played the shift engineer role for ERCOT and helped the islands synchrnize and go to constant frequency control and eventualy to the coordinated with Qlumen and NRG which had the largest regulation up and down to sync and Q lumen stayed on CFC and NRG of CFC, on the last day as there were more intertia in the system system was much more stable and they were able to quickly transfer mode to Load frequency control. ERCOT eventually took over and started using emergency basepoints to the generators and later on market opened and SCED was running.

When I re-ran the study with the full set, I noticed that several units were failing the flat-start and dynamic response portions of the MOD tests \u2014 including oscillations in the excitation and governor responses that did not match expected behavior. | Task: My task was to identify the root cause of the failed validation and guide the customer toward correcting their model so it would pass both the reactive power (excitation) and turbine/governor response tests. This required careful analysis to determine whether the issue stemmed from data input, model parameterization, or the simulation setup itself. | Action: I re-examined their DYRE file line by line and compared it to the validated versions used in ERCOT\u2019s Dynamics Working Group (DWG) base cases. I found that one of the key parameters in their model had the opposite sign from what it should have been \u2014 causing the oscillations and failed results. I communicated my findings to the customer, explaining the likely root cause and confirming whether the negative sign was intentional. To ensure the validity of my approach, I performed the same series of tests on another plant model that had passed verification previously, and the results matched perfectly. Once the customer corrected the sign and provided an updated DYRE file, I re-ran the study and confirmed that all validation tests passed successfully. | Result: The corrected model passed both MOD-26 and MOD-27 requirements on the next attempt, saving the customer from further delays and compliance issues. By independently verifying the methodology on another plant, I built confidence in both the accuracy of our testing process and the integrity of our validation results. The customer expressed strong appreciation for my thoroughness and clear technical communication, and the project was used as a best-practice example for future dynamic model validations."

However, our process for generating P3 and P6 contingencies was highly manual \u2014 we had to visually inspect the network, select pairs of elements by trial and error, and run multiple iterations to find all possible violations. To ensure completeness, my colleagues and I were asked to perform these studies independently and then cross-verify our results, which was both time-consuming and inefficient. | Task: My goal was to improve the efficiency and consistency of this analysis by automating the generation of P3 and P6 contingencies, ensuring that no potential violations were missed while saving analyst time and effort. | Action: I developed a Python-based automation tool that systematically created all possible P3 and P6 contingencies by defining the appropriate subsystem size and generating every valid combination of two elements within that boundary. The tool automatically fed these contingencies into PSS\u00aeE for evaluation and extracted the resulting thermal and voltage violations. I tested the tool across multiple cases to confirm its accuracy and compared its outputs with manually generated studies to verify completeness. The results showed that my tool identified additional contingencies and violations that manual reviews had missed. | Result: The automation tool significantly improved the speed and thoroughness of our contingency analysis process. It reduced manual effort, eliminated redundant cross-verifications among engineers, and increased confidence in the completeness of the study results. The tool was later adopted by other engineers in our group as part of the standard workflow, becoming a key resource for improving consistency and efficiency in N-1 contingency analysis."
