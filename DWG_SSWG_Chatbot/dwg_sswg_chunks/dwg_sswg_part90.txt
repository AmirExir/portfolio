should be zero.
4.5.1.10	Load Drop Compensation
These two fields define the real and reactive impedance compensation components for voltage controlling transformers. They are ignored for MW and MVAR flow controlling transformers. SSWG Cases normally donâ€™t use these fields and they are set to zero by default.
4.5.1.10.1	Resistive Component
The resistive component of load drop compensation entered in per unit is based on the resistance between the location of the LTC and the point in the system at which voltage is to be regulated.
4.5.1.10.2	Reactive Component
Similar to the resistive component of load drop compensation, this value is entered in per unit and is based on the reactance between the location of the LTC and the point in the system at which voltage is to be regulated.
