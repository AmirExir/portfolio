meets Planning Guide 6.9(1)
ERCOT will utilize the latest data provided by the IEs/REs in the Security Screening Study, or Full Interconnection Study if started, to model the Resource using the simple model.

Unit Reactive Limits should be modeled at a 95% power factor of the PMAX.  Generator ID prefixes will be designated as specified in Appendix D.  

Each simple modeled generator will be modeled in the following Zone:

Zone Number	Zone Name
1189	SIMPLE_Model




4.3.1.2	Generation that meets Planning Guide 6.9(2)
Upon meeting Planning Guide 6.9(2), ERCOT will utilize Resource Registration data provided by IEs/REs in accordance with ERCOT Protocols, Market Guides and the Generation Interconnection Process to model the Resource.  Only net real and reactive generator outputs and ratings should be modeled in SSWG Cases. Net generation is equal to the gross generation minus station auxiliaries and other internal power requirements.  All non-self-serve generation connected at 60 kV and ab
