To determine responsibilities at a given time, the version of the ERCOT Protocols in effect at the time of the performance or non-performance of an action governs with respect to that action.  These Protocols are intended to implement ERCOT\u2019s functions as the Independent Organization for the ERCOT Region as certified by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) and as the Program Administrator appointed by the PUCT that is responsible for carrying out the administrative responsibilities related to the Renewable Energy Credit (REC) Program as set forth in subsection (h) of P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.173, Renewable Energy Credit Program.  Market Participants, the Independent Market Monitor (IMM), and ERCOT shall abide by these Protocols. \n(2)\tThe ERCOT Board, Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), and other ERCOT subcommittees authorized by the ERCOT Board or TAC or ERCOT may develop polices, guidelines, procedures, forms, and applications for the implementation of and operation under, these Protocols and to comply with applicable rules, laws, and orders of a Governmental Authority.  A policy, guideline, procedure, form, or application described above is an \u201cOther Binding Document.\u201d  Other Binding Documents do not include ERCOT\u2019s internal administrative procedures, documents and processes necessary to fulfill its role as the Independent Organization or as a registered Entity with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). \n(3)\tERCOT shall post the Other Binding Documents List and all Other Binding Documents to a part of the ERCOT website reserved for posting Other Binding Documents.  A TAC designated subcommittee shall review the Other Binding Documents List at least every four years, and modifications to the Other Binding Documents List shall be reviewed and considered by the TAC designated subcommittee and by TAC at its next scheduled meeting.  \n(4)\tAny revision of an Other Binding Document must follow the revision process set forth in that Other Binding Document.  If an Other Binding Document does not specify a revision process, the Other Binding Document shall be subject to the procedures in Section 21, Revision Request Process, and shall be treated as if it were a Protocol for purposes of the revision process.  \n(5)\tTo the extent that Other Binding Documents are not in conflict with these Protocols or with an Agreement to which it is a party, each Market Participant, the IMM, and ERCOT shall abide by the Other Binding Documents.  Taken together, these Protocols and the Other Binding Documents constitute all of the \u201cscheduling, operating, planning, reliability, and Settlement policies, rules, guidelines, and procedures established by the independent System Operator in ERCOT,\u201d as that phrase is used in subsection (j) of the Public Utility Regulatory Act, TEX. UTIL. CODE ANN. \u00a7 39.151 (Vernon 1998 & Supp. 2007) (PURA), Essential Organizations, that bind Market Participants.\n(6)\tExcept as provided below, if the provisions in any attachment to these Protocols or in any of the Other Binding Documents conflict with the provisions of Section 1, Overview, through Section 21, and Section 24, Retail Point to Point Communications, through Section 27, Securitization Uplift Charges, then the provisions of Section 1 through Section 21, and Section 24 through Section 27 prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.  If any provision of any Agreement conflicts with any provision of the Protocols, the Agreement prevails to the extent of the conflict.  Any Agreement provision that deviates from the standard form for that Agreement in Section 22, Attachments, must expressly state that the Agreement provision deviates from the standard form in Section 22.  Agreement provisions that deviate from the Protocols are effective only upon approval by the ERCOT Board on a showing of good cause.   \n(7)\tThese Protocols are not intended to govern the direct relationships between or among Market Participants except as expressly provided in these Protocols.  ERCOT is not responsible for any relationship between or among Market Participants to which ERCOT is not a party.\n1.2\tFunctions of ERCOT\n(1)\tERCOT is the Independent Organization certified by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) for the ERCOT Region.

SUBST. R. 25.362, Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) Governance, ECEII constitutes Protected Information that shall be protected from public disclosure, except as otherwise provided therein and in these Protocols.\n(3)\tERCOT may classify information as ECEII, regardless of whether the submitter has designated the information as ECEII or has otherwise requested ECEII status for the information, upon determining that the information is included on the list of items considered ECEII in Section 1.3.2.1, Items Considered ERCOT Critical Energy Infrastructure Information, or otherwise meets the definition of ECEII set forth in Section 2.1, Definitions.  Upon determining that information for which ECEII status has not been requested should be designated as ECEII, ERCOT shall notify the submitter.  A determination by ERCOT to classify information as ECEII is subject to review by the PUCT as set forth in Section 1.3.8, Commission Review of ERCOT Determinations Regarding Protected Information or ERCOT Critical Energy Infrastructure Information Status.\n(4)\tDifferent types of ECEII may involve different levels of security risk.  In its discretion, ERCOT may restrict Market Participant access to ECEII created or received by ERCOT that poses a high level of security risk, provided that ERCOT shall disclose such information to any Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) upon request and may disclose such information to any other Market Participant that ERCOT determines has a legitimate reliability-based need for that information, subject to the requirements and restrictions of this Section 1.3, Confidentiality.  If ERCOT determines that ECEII that is required to be posted on the ERCOT website or MIS Secure Area pursuant to these Protocols or an Other Binding Document poses a high level of security risk, ERCOT shall remove such information from the ERCOT website or MIS Secure Area notwithstanding such posting requirement, and shall promptly submit a Revision Request to remove the requirement to post such information.  If the Revision Request is withdrawn or rejected, ERCOT shall restore any information required to be posted to the MIS that had been removed pursuant to this paragraph.\n(5)\tA Receiving Party or Creating Party of ECEII shall adopt procedures to ensure that ECEII is securely maintained and the organization\u2019s internal distribution of ECEII is reasonably restricted to appropriate individuals. \n(6)\tA Receiving Party or Creating Party may not knowingly use ECEII for any illegal purpose.\n(7)\tBefore disclosing ECEII to a representative or agent of the Receiving Party or Creating Party, the Receiving Party or Creating Party shall require a nondisclosure agreement with that representative or agent, except that a nondisclosure agreement shall not be required for the Receiving Party or Creating Party to disclose ECEII to that party\u2019s attorney.\n1.3.2.1\tItems Considered ERCOT Critical Energy Infrastructure Information\n(1)\tECEII includes but is not limited to the following, so long as such information has not been disclosed to the public through lawful means:\n(a)\tDetailed ERCOT System Infrastructure locational information, such as Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates;\n(b)\tInformation that reveals that a specified contingency or fault results in instability, cascading or uncontrolled separation;\n(c)\tStudies and results of simulations that identify cyber and physical security vulnerabilities of ERCOT System Infrastructure;\n(d)\tBlack Start Service (BSS) test results, individual Black Start Resource start-up procedures, cranking paths, and ERCOT and individual TSP Black Start plans;\n(e)\tInformation contained in Section 1.B. and Exhibit 1 to the Standard Form Black Start Agreement (Section 22, Attachment D, Standard Form Black Start Agreement), except for the Hourly Standby Price, Notice, and Certification sections.

The submission of information labeled as ECEII constitutes a representation by the submitter that the information is ECEII as defined in these Protocols.  The submitter shall also segregate those portions of the information that contain ECEII wherever feasible.\n(2)\tFailure to request ECEII treatment or failure to conspicuously label or segregate ECEII information submitted to ERCOT in accordance with paragraph (1) above may result in non-ECEII treatment of the information by ERCOT and release of the information to the public.\n(3)\tFor any submission of information asserted to be ECEII, ERCOT may, at any time following the submission, request that the submitter provide a written justification for such treatment.  The submitter shall provide such a justification, if any, within five Business Days.  The justification must explain how the information, or any portion of the information, qualifies as ECEII, as such term is defined in Section 2.1, Definitions, and must identify any law, regulation, or order that protects the information, or any portion of the information, from disclosure.  The request shall also include a statement of how long the ECEII designation should apply to the information and support for the period proposed.  ERCOT shall consider any submitted justification before determining whether the information qualifies as ECEII.  ERCOT shall not disclose or permit disclosure of any information protected from disclosure pursuant to law, regulation, or order.  ERCOT shall notify the submitter of its determination within five Business Days after receiving the submission.  ERCOT shall continue to treat as ECEII information originally claimed to be ECEII for five Business Days following the date ERCOT notified the submitter of its determination.  A determination by ERCOT not to classify information as ECEII is subject to review by the PUCT as set forth in Section 1.3.8, Commission Review of ERCOT Determinations Regarding Protected Information or ERCOT Critical Energy Infrastructure Information Status.\n1.3.3\tRESERVED\n1.3.4\tProtecting Disclosures to the PUCT, FERC, CFTC, Governmental Cybersecurity Oversight Agencies, and Other Governmental Authorities\n(1)\tAny disclosure that a Receiving Party makes to the PUCT must be made under applicable PUCT rules.

This exception does not limit FERC\u2019s, NERC\u2019s, or the NERC Regional Entity\u2019s access to Protected Information or ECEII as it existed on September 1, 2024; or\n(m)\tTo ERCOT and its consultants, the IMM, the Reliability Monitor, and members of task forces and working groups of ERCOT, if engaged in performing analysis of abnormal system conditions, disturbances, unusual events, and abnormal system performance, or engaged in tasks involving ECEII for support of the ERCOT Transmission Grid.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, task forces and working groups may not receive Ancillary Service Offer prices or other competitively sensitive price or cost information before expiration of its status as Protected Information, and each member of a task force or working group shall execute a confidentiality agreement with requirements substantially similar to those in Section 1.3, prior to receiving any Protected Information or ECEII.  Data to be disclosed under this exception to task forces and working groups must be limited to clearly defined periods surrounding the relevant conditions, events, or performance under review and must be limited in scope to information pertinent to the condition or events under review and may include the following:\n(i)\tQSE Ancillary Service awards and deployments, in aggregate and by type of Resource;\n(ii)\tResource facility availability status, including the status of switching devices, auxiliary loads, and mechanical systems that had a material impact on Resource facility availability or an adverse impact on the transmission system operation;\n(iii)\tIndividual Resource information including Base Points, maximum/minimum generating capability, droop setting, real power output, and reactive output;\n(iv)\tResource protective device settings and status;\n(v)\tData from COPs; \n(vi)\tResource Outage schedule information; and\n(vii)\tBSS test results and ERCOT\u2019s Black Start plan, including individual Black Start Resource start-up procedures, cranking paths, and individual TSP Black Start plans;\n(n)\tTo the CFTC if requested from ERCOT by the CFTC as part of an investigation or regulatory inquiry authorized pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and the CFTC\u2019s regulations or if required to be submitted to the CFTC pursuant to any other law, provided that ERCOT, as the Receiving Party or Creating Party, must timely submit a written request for confidential treatment in accordance with the CFTC\u2019s regulations or other applicable law; \n(o)\tTo a Governmental Cybersecurity Oversight Agency regarding a Cybersecurity Incident, if ERCOT is the Receiving Party, and disclosure of Protected Information is made to a Governmental Cybersecurity Oversight Agency or delegated entity for the purpose of ensuring the safety and/or security of the ERCOT System or ERCOT\u2019s ability to perform the functions of an independent organization under PURA; or\n(p)\tIncidentally as part of a tour of the ERCOT control room provided to persons determined by ERCOT to be eligible to participate in the tour.  Prior to accessing the ERCOT control room, such persons must sign a nondisclosure agreement required by ERCOT and comply with the screening and other requirements provided in a policy adopted by ERCOT security.  The policy will include a prohibition against taking photographs or recordings of Protected Information or ECEII.  This subsection does not apply to a person who is a director, officer, employee, agent, representative, contractor, or consultant of a Market Participant that is registered with ERCOT as one or more of the following registration types: Resource Entity, QSE, LSE, or CRR Account Holder. \n(2)\tProtected Information may not be disclosed to other Market Participants prior to ten days following the Operating Day under review, except as permitted in paragraph (1)(n) above.\n(3)\tERCOT may disclose, and may authorize a Receiving Party or Creating Party to disclose, ECEII to the public or to any person under the provisions of this paragraph, except for ECEII otherwise protected from disclosure pursuant to law, regulation, or order. \n(a)\tERCOT may propose to disclose ECEII that is not otherwise protected from disclosure pursuant to law, regulation, or order.  Any Receiving Party or Creating Party other than ERCOT may request ERCOT authorization to disclose such ECEII.\n(i)\tERCOT may propose to disclose ECEII that is not otherwise protected from disclosure pursuant to law, regulation, or order if it determines that the public benefit of the proposed disclosure of ECEII outweighs the potential harm resulting from the disclosure.  ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice regarding ERCOT\u2019s intent to disclose the ECEII, subject to objection as further provided in paragraph (c) below. \n(ii)\tA request by a Receiving Party or Creating Party other than ERCOT for authorization to disclose ECEII shall be submitted by e-mail to ERCOT\u2019s General Counsel.  If the ECEII is not otherwise protected from disclosure pursuant to law, regulation, or order, and ERCOT determines that the public benefit of the proposed disclosure of ECEII outweighs the potential harm resulting from the disclosure, ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice authorizing the ECEII to be disclosed, subject to objection as further provided in paragraph (c) below.  ERCOT shall make such a determination no later than five Business Days following the date it receives the request.\n(b)\tThe Market Notice issued pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) above shall identify the ECEII to be disclosed; the party requesting the disclosure; the public benefit justifying the proposed disclosure; the date on which the information may be disclosed, which shall be no sooner than five Business Days following the date of the Market Notice; and, if the proposed disclosure is not to the public, the persons to whom ECEII would be disclosed.  The authorization shall be effective unless a Market Participant submits an objection pursuant to paragraph (c) below.  \n(c)\tAny Market Participant may submit written objections to the proposed disclosure.  Such objections shall be submitted by e-mail to ERCOT\u2019s General Counsel no later than the end of the fourth Business Day following the issuance of the Market Notice described in paragraph (b) above.  Failure to object to the proposed allowance of ECEII disclosure pursuant to this paragraph shall constitute a waiver of any such objection for all purposes.  ERCOT shall provide notice of the objection to the party requesting authorization to disclose ECEII no later than the end of the Business Day following receipt of the objection.  The party requesting authorization to disclose ECEII shall not disclose the ECEII if it has been notified of any objection pursuant to this paragraph unless and until ERCOT issues a second Market Notice authorizing disclosure, as provided in paragraph (d) below.  \n(d)\tIf one or more objections to disclosure is submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) above, ERCOT shall issue a second Market Notice describing each such objection and stating whether the objection affects ERCOT\u2019s determination as to the proposed disclosure of ECEII.  If ERCOT determines that the ECEII should still be disclosed notwithstanding these objections, the second Market Notice shall establish the date on which the ECEII may be disclosed, which shall be no sooner than the fifth Business Day following the issuance of the second Market Notice.  ERCOT\u2019s determination in the second Market Notice is a final decision that may be challenged at the PUCT without using the processes described in Section 20, Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedure and Procedure for Return of Settlement Funds.  If ERCOT authorizes a non-public disclosure of ECEII, the party disclosing the ECEII shall require each recipient of ECEII to enter into a nondisclosure agreement that includes the restrictions against disclosure described in Section 1.3.2, ERCOT Critical Energy Infrastructure Information, as a condition for obtaining the ECEII.\n(e)\tNotwithstanding anything in this Section, ERCOT may disclose ECEII to any federal, state or local government official without issuing a Market Notice if ERCOT determines that such disclosure is necessary to facilitate the government official\u2019s public duties and that the delay associated with providing the Notice otherwise required by this paragraph (3) would impair that government official\u2019s ability to take action to address a public emergency.  As soon as practicable, but no later than 24 hours following the disclosure:\n(i)\tERCOT shall provide Notice to the Disclosing Party and all Market Participants materially impacted by the disclosure; and\n(ii)\tERCOT shall issue a Market Notice describing the disclosure, unless ERCOT determines that such a Notice could jeopardize public safety or welfare, in which case no Notice is required.\n(iii)\tEach Disclosing Party, other than ERCOT, shall provide Notice to each Creating Party whose information has been disclosed pursuant to this paragraph (e).\n(f)\tNotwithstanding anything in this Section, any Receiving Party or Creating Party other than ERCOT may disclose ECEII to any federal, state or local government official without requesting prior authorization from ERCOT if the Receiving Party or Creating Party determines that such disclosure is necessary to facilitate the government official\u2019s public duties and that the delay associated with requesting prior ERCOT authorization as otherwise required by this paragraph (3) would impair that government official\u2019s ability to take action to address a public emergency.  \n(i)\tThe Receiving Party or Creating Party shall provide Notice to ERCOT and all Market Participants materially impacted by the disclosure as soon as practicable, but no later than 24 hours following the disclosure.\n(ii)\tERCOT shall issue a Market Notice describing the disclosure as soon as practicable, but no later than 24 hours following receipt of notice from the Receiving Party or Creating Party, unless ERCOT determines that such a Notice could jeopardize public safety or welfare, in which case no Notice is required.\n1.3.7\tSpecific Performance \n(1)\tIt will be impossible or very difficult to measure in monetary terms the damages that would accrue due to any breach by Receiving Party of Section 1.3, Confidentiality, or any failure to perform any obligation contained in Section 1.3 and, for that reason, among others, a Disclosing Party affected by a disclosure or threatened disclosure is entitled to specific performance of Section 1.3.  In the event that a Disclosing Party institutes any proceeding to enforce any part of Section 1.3, the affected Receiving Party, by entering any agreement incorporating these Protocols, now waives any claim or defense that an adequate remedy at law exists for such a breach.\n1.3.8\tCommission Review of ERCOT Determinations Regarding Protected Information or ERCOT Critical Energy Infrastructure Information Status \n(1)\tA determination by ERCOT that one or more items are or are not Protected Information or ECEII, or that the public benefit of the proposed disclosure of ECEII outweighs the potential harm resulting from the disclosure, is a final decision that may be challenged at the PUCT without using the processes described in Section 20, Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedure and Procedure for Return of Settlement Funds.  Any Entity materially affected by ERCOT\u2019s determination shall, as a condition for seeking relief at the PUCT, notify ERCOT\u2019s General Counsel no later than 1700 Central Prevailing Time (CPT) on the date five Business Days following the date ERCOT notified the submitter of its determination and shall file any complaint against ERCOT no later than 35 days following the date of the final decision, pursuant to P.U.C. PROC. R. 22.251, Review of Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) Conduct.  If an Entity materially affected by ERCOT\u2019s determination notifies ERCOT that it is challenging ERCOT\u2019s determination and files a complaint no later than 35 days following the ERCOT determination, ERCOT shall not disclose the information until the PUCT issues a final order authorizing such release.\n1.4\tOperational Audit\n1.4.1\tMaterials Subject to Audit\n(1)\tERCOT\u2019s records and documentation pertaining to its operation as the certified Independent Organization for the ERCOT Region are subject to audit in the manner prescribed herein.  The rights of Market Participants to audit ERCOT are limited to the provisions in Section 1.4, Operational Audit.\n1.4.2\tERCOT Finance and Audit Committee\n(1)\tThe ERCOT Board shall have overall audit responsibility for ERCOT.  The ERCOT Board may fulfill audit responsibilities itself or delegate them to the ERCOT Finance and Audit (F&A) Committee.  Upon delegation, the ERCOT F&A Committee shall make recommendations to the ERCOT Board or directly appoint an external independent certified public accounting firm or firms (\u201cAppointed Firm\u201d) to conduct certain audits.  For audits performed by an Appointed Firm, the ERCOT F&A Committee shall directly approve the initiation, scheduling, and reporting of such audits or make recommendations to the ERCOT Board.  The ERCOT F&A Committee may also direct the ERCOT Internal Audit Department to conduct certain audits.  The ERCOT F&A Committee shall approve an annual audit plan for the ERCOT Internal Audit Department.  \n1.4.3\tOperations Audit\n1.4.3.1\tAudits to Be Performed\n(1)\tAt least annually, an Appointed Firm shall perform a System and Organization Control (SOC) audit of ERCOT regarding ERCOT\u2019s market Settlements operations.  \n(2)\tThe ERCOT Internal Audit Department will conduct audits of the following on a periodic basis no less than once every three years:\n(a)\tCompliance with ERCOT\u2019s policies that prohibit employees from:\n(i) \tBeing involved in business decisions where the individual stands to gain or lose personally from the decision;  \n(ii) \tHaving a direct financial interest in a Market Participant; \n(iii) \tServing in an advisory, consulting, technical or management capacity for any business organization that does significant business with ERCOT (other than through service on ERCOT committees); and \n(iv) \tAccepting any gifts or entertainment of significant value from employees or representatives of any Market Participant doing business in ERCOT.  Such gifts and entertainment shall not exceed the limits specified in ERCOT\u2019s Code of Conduct and Ethics Corporate Standard and other applicable policies.\n(b)\tWhether ERCOT is operating in compliance with the confidentiality and Protected Information provisions of these Protocols; \n(c)\tVerification that ERCOT, in its administration of these Protocols, is operating independently of control by any Market Participant or group of Market Participants; and\n(d)\tAny audit required by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT).\n1.4.3.2\tMaterial Issues\n(1)\tThe audits performed under Section 1.4.3.1, Audits to be Performed,  may also include material issues raised by ERCOT Members and/or Market Participants if:\n(a)\tSuch issues have been presented to TAC, approved by TAC and approved by the ERCOT F&A Committee for inclusion in the audit scope; or \n(b)\tSuch issues are part of a random sample of complaints selected by the auditors for review, and affected Market Participants have agreed in writing to the examination of their related information in the compliance audit.\n(2)\tMembers and Market Participants shall send any requests regarding such issues to the ERCOT TAC Chairperson designee identified on the MIS for inclusion on the TAC agenda.\n1.4.4\tAudit Results\n(1)\tUnless a longer time frame is reasonably necessary (e.g., for the market Settlements SOC audit, which is performed over a significant period of time), each audit report will be prepared and finalized no later than four months after the initiation of the audit.  Results of all audits performed pursuant to this Section shall be reported to the ERCOT F&A Committee.  These audits will be filed with the PUCT in accordance with PUCT Rules.  ERCOT may file an audit as confidential and Protected Information in order to protect Protected Information and other confidential or sensitive information therein.  Findings and recommended actions identified as a result of an audit will be reviewed by the ERCOT F&A Committee. The results of the audits required by this Section and the recommended actions to be taken by ERCOT shall be provided to ERCOT Members and Market Participants upon request to the extent these items do not contain Protected Information or other confidential or sensitive information.  \n1.4.5\tAvailability of Records\n(1)\tSubject to the requirements of Section 1.4.6, Confidentiality of Information, ERCOT will provide the ERCOT Internal Audit Department, and/or the Appointed Firm and any other staff augmentation resources full and complete access to all financial books, cost statements, accounting records, and all documentation pertaining to the requirements of the specific audits being performed.  ERCOT will retain records relating to audits until the records retention requirements of ERCOT are satisfied; or until the audit issues are fully resolved, whichever is the later.  Such retention shall be a term of not less than four years and not be required for more than seven years.  This Section 1.4, Operational Audit, is not intended to require ERCOT to create any new records, reports, studies, or evaluations.\n1.4.6\tConfidentiality of Information\n(1)\tAll Protected Information as defined in these Protocols obtained by the Appointed Firm or other staff augmentation resources through any audits will remain strictly confidential.  To retain control of Protected Information, ERCOT will require that each Appointed Firm and each individual staff augmentation resource  either (i) sign a confidentiality agreement with terms substantially similar to the terms of Section 1.3, Confidentiality, above before being allowed access to any ERCOT records or documentation; or (ii) observe the Appointed Firm\u2019s internal confidentiality policies and procedures, whichever is acceptable to ERCOT\u2019s Legal Department but is no less stringent than the terms of Section 1.3.  Audit reports and/or results provided to Market Participants or ERCOT Members shall not contain any Protected Information.\n1.5\tERCOT Fees and Charges\n(1)\tFees and charges to Market Participants for use of the ERCOT scheduling, settlement, registration, and other related systems and equipment are set forth in these Protocols.  The ERCOT Board may adopt additional fees and charges as reasonably necessary to cover the additional costs of such systems and equipment.  Market Participants are responsible for all such applicable fees and charges.  ERCOT shall post a schedule of ERCOT fees and charges on the ERCOT website within two Business Days of change. \n1.6\tOpen Access to the ERCOT Transmission Grid \n1.6.1\tOverview \n(1)\tOpen access to the ERCOT Transmission Grid must be provided to all Eligible Transmission Service Customers by Transmission Service Providers (TSPs) and ERCOT under these Protocols and the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) Substantive Rules, Chapter 25, Substantive Rules Applicable to Electric Service Providers, Subchapter I, Transmission and Distribution.\n1.6.2\tEligibility for Transmission Service \n(1)\tTransmission Service is available to all Eligible Transmission Service Customers.  Energy may be transmitted and Ancillary Service may be provided on behalf of an Eligible Transmission Service Customer through the ERCOT System only through a Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE).  \n1.6.3\tNature of Transmission Service \n(1)\tTransmission Service allows all Eligible Transmission Service Customers to deliver and receive Energy using the Transmission Facilities of all of the Transmission Service Providers (TSPs) in ERCOT under PUCT Substantive Rules.  \n1.6.4\tPayment for Transmission Access Service \n(1)\tERCOT may not collect Transmission Access Service fees for the TSPs\u2019 cost of service.  ERCOT shall provide volumetric data, pursuant to Section 9, Settlement and Billing, to the TSPs so that the TSPs can calculate their Transmission access fees.  ERCOT\u2019s collection and settlement process associated with ERCOT\u2019s scheduling and deployment of Ancillary Service is addressed separately in these Protocols.\n1.6.5\tInterconnection of New or Existing Generation \n(1)\tInterconnection of new Generation Resources or Settlement Only Generators (SOGs) to the ERCOT Transmission Grid must be in accordance with the Protocols, the Planning Guide, the Nodal Operating Guide and Other Binding Documents.  \n[NPRR995 and NPRR1246:  Replace applicable portions of paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation for NPRR995;

Review periods for Planned Outage consideration do not commence until sufficient and complete information is submitted to ERCOT as described in Section 3.1.6.2, Resource Outage Plan.\n3.1.6.8\tResource Outage Rejection Notice\n(1)\tIf ERCOT rejects a request for a Planned Outage, ERCOT shall provide the QSE a written or electronic rejection notice that includes:\n(a)\tSpecific reasons causing the rejection; or\n(b)\tPossible remedies or Resource schedule revisions, if any, that might mitigate the basis for rejection.\n(2)\tERCOT may reject a Planned Outage of Resource facilities only:\n(a)\tTo protect the reliability or security of the ERCOT System;\n(b)\tDue to insufficient information regarding the Outage;\n(c)\tDue to failure to comply with submittal process requirements, as specified in these Protocols;\n(d)\tTo stay within the Maximum Daily Resource Planned Outage Capacity; or\n(e)\tAs specified elsewhere in these Protocols.\n(3)\tWhen multiple proposed Planned Outages or Maintenance Outages cause a known capacity conflict, ERCOT shall:\n(a)\tCommunicate with each QSE to see if the QSE will adjust its proposed Planned Outage schedule;\n(b)\tDetermine if each QSE will agree to an alternative Outage schedule; or\n(c)\tReject, in ERCOT\u2019s sole discretion, one or more proposed Outages, considering order of receipt and impact to the ERCOT System.\n3.1.6.9\tWithdrawal of Approval and Rescheduling of Approved Planned Outages of Resource Facilities\n(1)\tIf ERCOT believes it cannot meet applicable reliability standards and has exercised all other reasonable options, and any actions taken pursuant to Section 3.1.4.6, Outage Coordination of Potential Transmission Emergency Conditions, have not resolved the situation, then ERCOT shall conduct a preliminary Outage Adjustment Evaluation (OAE) and issue an Advance Action Notice (AAN) pursuant to Section 6.5.9.3.1.1, Advance Action Notice.  \n(a)\tThe AAN shall describe the reliability problem, the date and time that the possible Emergency Condition would begin, the date and time that the possible Emergency Condition would end, and a summary of the actions ERCOT believes it might take, including, if applicable, the amount of capacity it would seek from one or more OSAs based on the preliminary OAE.  The AAN must state the earliest time at which ERCOT will issue OSAs, if an OSA is deemed necessary.\n(b)\tERCOT shall issue the AAN a minimum of 24 hours prior to issuing any OSA.  Additionally, unless impracticable pursuant to paragraph (3)(f) below, OSAs should not be issued until eight Business Hours have elapsed following issuance of the AAN.  ERCOT shall not issue an OSA under this Section unless it has first completed an updated OAE after these time periods have passed.\n(c)\tFollowing the AAN, ERCOT may communicate with Market Participants about the reliability problem, however, ERCOT may not provide information about market conditions to a subset of Market Participants that is not generally available to all Market Participants.  \n(d)\tAs conditions change, ERCOT shall, to the extent practicable, update the AAN in order to provide simultaneous notice to Market Participants.  \n(e)\tThis section does not limit Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) access to ERCOT data and communications. \n(2)\tBefore the time stated in the AAN when ERCOT will issue any OSAs, each QSE shall:\n(a) \tUpdate its Resource COPs and the Outage Scheduler to the best of its ability to reflect any decisions to voluntarily delay or cancel any Outage so as to remove the Outage from updated OAE and OSA consideration;  \n(b) \tNotify ERCOT if a specific Resource cannot be considered for an OSA, for all or part of the period covered by the AAN, due to Resource reliability, compliance with contractual warranty obligations, or other reasons beyond the Resource\u2019s control; and\n(c)\tNotify ERCOT of any Resource that is currently on Outage that the QSE agrees could be returned to service, upon receipt of an OSA, for all or part of the period covered by the AAN.\n(3)\tIf, after the earliest OSA issuance time has passed as noted in paragraph (1)(b) above, ERCOT continues to forecast an inability to meet applicable reliability standards after the updates to the Resource COPs and Outage Schedules, ERCOT may issue one or more OSAs.  \n(a)\tERCOT may contact QSEs representing Resources for more information prior to conducting any updated OAE or issuing an OSA.\n(b)\tERCOT may not consider nuclear-powered Generation Resources for an OSA.\n(c)\tERCOT will not consider any Resource for an OSA if the Resource\u2019s QSE notified ERCOT prior to the earliest issuance time of any OSA stated in the AAN that the Resource cannot be considered for an OSA for the reasons specified in paragraph (2)(b) above.\n(d)\tIn order to determine which Outages to delay, ERCOT shall first consider the Outage duration, dividing the Outages in categories of zero to two days, two to four days, four to seven days, or more than seven days, then withdraw approval on a last in, first out basis within that duration category, so that shorter Outages are delayed first, and the timing of Outage submissions is considered within that category.\n(e)\tAfter the earliest issuance time of the OSAs stated in the AAN, if the updated OAE shows that one or more OSAs is still necessary, ERCOT shall post a message to the ERCOT website stating that it will issue one or more OSAs and shall provide verbal notice to TSPs and QSEs via the Hotline.  Subsequent to this notification, and for the entire period identified in the AAN, the QSE may not voluntarily modify the Resource\u2019s Outage, but is subject to the issuance of an OSA.\n(f)\tERCOT may only issue an OSA to the QSE for a Resource that has a Resource Outage in the Outage Scheduler during the timeframe of the forecasted Emergency Condition described above in this section.\n(g)\tIf the Resource Outage for which the OSA would be issued is scheduled to begin before eight Business Hours have elapsed following issuance of the AAN, ERCOT may issue the OSA prior to the beginning of the Resource Outage after the end of the 24-hour notice period.\n(h)\tFollowing the receipt of an OSA, for the OSA Period: \n(i)\tThe QSE for the Resource may choose to show the Resource as OFF in the COP or may elect to leave the Resource On-Line due to equipment or reliability concerns or if the Resource Category is coal or lignite.  If the QSE for the Resource intends to leave the Resource On-Line, it must communicate to the ERCOT control room the anticipated start and end time of the On-Line period.  ERCOT will issue one or multiple RUC instructions to the QSE of the Resource for the anticipated On-Line period within the OSA Period for each Operating Day.  While On-Line, the Resource must utilize a status of ONRUC and cannot opt out of RUC Settlement;\n(ii)\tIf the Resource remains On-Line pursuant to paragraph (i) above, it must remain at Low Sustained Limit (LSL) unless deployed above LSL by Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED);\n(iii)\tIf the Resource has a COP Resource Status of OFF at any point during the OSA Period, and ERCOT requires the Resource to be On-Line, or if ERCOT requires a Resource with a planned derate to maintain its capacity, ERCOT will issue a RUC instruction to the Resource\u2019s QSE for the required commitment period.  While On-Line, the Resource must utilize a status of ONRUC and cannot opt out of RUC Settlement; \n(iv)\tThe QSE must update the Resource\u2019s Energy Offer Curve to $4,500/MWh for all MW levels from 0 MW to the HSL when the High System-Wide Offer Cap (HCAP) is in effect.  If the Low-System Wide Offer Cap (LCAP) is in effect, the QSE must update the Resource\u2019s Energy Offer Curve equal to LCAP for all MW levels from 0 MW to HSL; and\n[NPRR930:  Replace paragraph (iv) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(iv)\tERCOT shall create proxy Energy Offer Curves for the Resource under paragraph (4)(d)(iii) of Section 6.5.7.3, Security Constrained Economic Dispatch; and\n(v)\tThe QSE for the Resource cannot submit a Three Part Supply Offer into the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) for any Operating Day during the OSA Period.\n(4)\tERCOT shall work in good faith with the QSEs to reschedule any delayed or canceled Outages resulting from an AAN under paragraph (1) above, regardless of whether the Resource took voluntary actions or received an OSA.  The Outage must be rescheduled so that it is completed within 120 days of the end of the OSA Period.  ERCOT, in its sole discretion, may approve any Outage that is rescheduled due to an AAN or OSA even if it would cause the aggregate MW of approved Resource Outages to exceed the Maximum Daily Resource Planned Outage Capacity.\n(a)\tIf ERCOT issues an OSA, the QSE may submit a new request for approval of the Planned Outage schedule, however the new Outage may not begin prior to the end time of the OSA Period.  \n(b)\tIf a transmission Outage was scheduled in coordination with a Resource Outage that is delayed, ERCOT shall also delay that transmission Outage when necessary.\n(5)\tIf insufficient capacity to meet the need described in the AAN is made available through the processes described in paragraphs (2) and (3) above, ERCOT may contact QSEs with Resources that are currently on Outage in the Outage Scheduler and that the QSE has agreed could be returned to service upon receipt of an OSA.  ERCOT may issue an OSA to the QSE for any Resource that the QSE agrees can feasibly be returned to service during the period of the possible Emergency Condition described in the AAN.\n(6)\tIf system conditions change such that the need described in the AAN increases, ERCOT shall update the AAN and may repeat the process described in this section.  For any subsequent iterations of this process, ERCOT shall issue the updated AAN with as much lead time as is practical prior to starting any subsequent OAE, but with a minimum of two hours\u2019 notice. \n(7)\tThe preliminary OAE may not assume total renewable production lower than the sum of the selected Wind-powered Generation Resource Production Potential (WGRPP) and PhotoVoltaic Generation Resource Production Potential (PVGRPP) forecasts for each hour less any reasonably expected severe weather impacts.  The available capacity in ERCOT\u2019s planning assessment must include targeted reserve levels and include forecasted capacity available through DC Tie imports or curtailment of DC Tie exports, forecasted capacity provided from Settlement Only Distributed Generators (SODGs) and Settlement Only Transmission Generators (SOTGs), and forecasted capacity from price-responsive Demand based on information reported to ERCOT in accordance with Section 3.10.7.2.1, Reporting of Demand Response.  ERCOT must post the following inputs to the preliminary OAE to the ERCOT website within an hour of issuing an AAN, including but not limited to:\n(a)\tThe Load forecast; \n(b)\tLoad forecast vendor selection;\n(c)\tWind forecast;\n(d)\tWind forecast vendor selection;\n(e)\tSolar forecast;\n(f)\tSolar forecast vendor selection;\n(g)\tExpected severe weather impacts forecast;\n(h)\tTargeted reserve levels;\n(i)\tDC Tie import forecast;\n(j)\tDC Tie export curtailment forecast;\n(k)\tSODG and SOTG forecasts; \n(l)\tThe forecast of capacity provided by price-responsive Demand;\n(m)\tAny aggregate derating of Resource(s) and/or Forced Outage assumptions in total MWs; and\n(n)\tAny aggregate fuel derating assumptions in total MWs.\n[NPRR995:  Replace paragraph (7) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(7)\tThe preliminary OAE may not assume total renewable production lower than the sum of the selected Wind-powered Generation Resource Production Potential (WGRPP) and PhotoVoltaic Generation Resource Production Potential (PVGRPP) forecasts for each hour less any reasonably expected severe weather impacts.

The unforeseen Real-Time condition cannot be the result of changes that Ancillary Services are procured to address.  In exercising its discretion under this paragraph, ERCOT is not required to issue an AAN or OAE before issuing an OSA, but shall:\n(a)\tIssue the OSA to the QSE of the Resource for the purpose of make whole compensation; and\n(b)\tPresent the justification for the out of market action to the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) at its next meeting that is at least 14 Business Days after the OSA.\n3.1.6.10\tOpportunity Outage\n(1)\tOpportunity Outages for Resources are a special category of Planned Outages that may be approved by ERCOT when a specific Resource has been forced Off-Line due to a Forced Outage and the Resource has been previously approved for a Planned Outage during the next two days.\n(2)\tWhen a Forced Outage occurs on a Resource that has an approved Outage scheduled within the following two days, the Resource may remain Off-Line and start the approved Outage earlier than scheduled.

DC Tie Load Zones are not subject to these requirements.\n(2)       The addition of Load that is new to the ERCOT System to an existing Load Zone does not constitute a change to a Load Zone under this section.  This provision includes the transfer of existing Load from a non-ERCOT Control Area into a Load Zone in the ERCOT System.  Adding Load that is new to the ERCOT System to an existing Load Zone does not require ERCOT Board approval, and no notice period is required prior to adding such Load to an existing Load Zone.\n(3)\tA NOIE that was included in the establishment of an automatic pre-assigned NOIE Load Zone under paragraph (1)(c) of Section 3.4.3 may elect to be assigned to an appropriate Competitive Load Zone after giving notice of termination of its power supply arrangement if a request to be assigned to a Competitive Load Zone was given to ERCOT at least 90 days prior to the start of the Pre-Assigned Congestion Revenue Right (PCRR) nomination window for the effective year of the Load Zone change.  The move to a Competitive Load Zone requires ERCOT Board approval and shall be effective no sooner than the first day of the PCRR Nomination Year.  \n3.4.3\tNOIE Load Zones\n(1)\tThe descriptions and conditions set forth below apply to Load Zones established by NOIEs:\n(a)\tThere are four NOIE Load Zones that were approved prior to the Texas Nodal Market Implementation Date: Austin Energy, City Public Service, Rayburn Country Electric Cooperative, and Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA); \n(b)\tAny costs allocated based upon a zonal Load Ratio Share (LRS) must be allocated using \u201cCost-Allocation Load Zones,\u201d which are the four Load Zones in effect during the 2003 ERCOT market unless they are changed pursuant to Section 3.4.2, Load Zone Modifications.  For these allocation purposes, any NOIE Load Zone is considered to be located entirely within the 2003 ERCOT Congestion Management Zone (CMZ) that represented the largest Load for that NOIE or group of NOIEs in 2003;\n(c)\tA separate NOIE Load Zone is made up of a group of NOIEs that are parties to the same pre-1999 power supply arrangements and that had an overall 2003 peak Load in excess of 2,300 MW.  A NOIE that is a member of this separate NOIE Load Zone and that has given notice of termination of its pre-1999 power supply arrangement may elect to be assigned to an appropriate Competitive Load Zone.

ERCOT shall notify the QSE by means of the Messaging System if the QSE\u2019s COP fails to comply with the criteria described in Section 3.9.1 and this Section 3.9.2 for any reason.  The QSE must then resubmit the COP within the appropriate market timeline.\n(2)\tERCOT may reject a COP that does not meet the criteria described in Section 3.9.1.\n(3)\tIf a Resource is designated in the COP to provide Ancillary Service, then ERCOT shall verify that the COP complies with Section 3.16, Standards for Determining Ancillary Service Quantities.  The Ancillary Service Supply Responsibilities as indicated in the Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility submitted immediately before the end of the Adjustment Period are physically binding commitments for each QSE for the corresponding Operating Period. \n(4)\tERCOT shall notify the QSE if the sum of the Ancillary Service capacity designated in the COP for each hour, by service type, is less than the QSE\u2019s Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility for each service type for that hour.

ERCOT shall publish the list of important telemetry points quarterly on the MIS Secure Area.\n(3)\tERCOT shall use the following criteria to identify the important telemetry points: \n(a) \tLoss of a telemetry point that results in the inability of ERCOT to monitor loading on a transmission line operated at 345 kV or above.\n(b) \tLoss of a telemetry point that results in the inability of ERCOT to monitor loading on a 345/138 kV autotransformer.\n(c) \tLoss of a telemetry point that results in the inability of ERCOT to monitor the loading on Transmission Facilities designated as important to transmission reliability by ERCOT.  \n(d) \tTelemetry necessary to monitor Transmission Elements identified as causing 80% of all congestion cost in the year for which the most recent data is available.\n(e) \tTelemetry necessary to monitor the bus voltages at the 20 most important station voltage points. \n(4)\tEach TSP and QSE shall provide data to ERCOT such that 92% of the important telemetry points identified achieve a quarterly availability of 90%.  Availability shall be measured based on end-to-end connectivity of the communications path and the passing of Real-Time data with Valid, Manual, or Calculated quality codes at the scheduled periodicity.  Quality codes are defined in Section 3.10.7.5.8.1, Data Quality Codes.\n3.10.7.5.6\tTSP/QSE Telemetry Restoration\n(1)\tTelemetered data shall be provided continuously.  Real-Time data restoration shall comply with Nodal Operating Guide Sections 7.3.3, Data from WAN Participants to ERCOT, and 7.3.4, Resolving Real-Time Data Issues that affect ERCOT Network Security Analysis.  \n(2)\tSome data may be more essential to the State Estimator solution.  ERCOT shall inform the TSP or QSE if, in the sole opinion of ERCOT, a data item is essential and needs to be repaired as quickly as possible.  QSEs and TSPs shall make repair procedures and records available to ERCOT upon request.  When ERCOT notifies a data provider that a data element is providing telemetry data inconsistent with surrounding measurements, the provider shall, within 30 days, do one of the following: \n(a) \tCalibrate or repair the failing equipment; \n(b) \tRequest an outage to schedule calibration or repair of the failing equipment; \n(c) \tProvide ERCOT with a plan to re-calibrate or repair the equipment in a reasonable time frame; or \n(d)\tProvide ERCOT with engineering analysis proving the data element is providing accuracy within its specifications.   \n(3)\tBefore ERCOT requests review or re-calibration of a problem piece of equipment, it shall discuss the problem with the data provider to attempt to arrive at a consensus decision on the most appropriate action. \n3.10.7.5.7\tCalibration, Quality Checking, and Testing\n(1)\tIt is the responsibility of the equipment owner to insure that calibration, testing, and other routine maintenance of equipment is done on a timely basis, and that accuracy meets or exceeds the requirements specified in this Section 3.10.7.5, Telemetry Requirements, for both the overall system and for individual equipment where detailed herein.  Coordination with ERCOT of outages required for these activities is also the responsibility of the owner.\n3.10.7.5.8\tInter-Control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP) Links\n3.10.7.5.8.1\tData Quality Codes\n(1)\tMarket Participants shall provide documentation to ERCOT describing their native system quality codes and defining the conversion of their quality codes into the ERCOT-defined quality codes. \n(2)\tStatuses and analogs telemetered to ERCOT shall be identified with the following quality codes:\n(a)\tValid \u2013 Represents an analog or status the TSP or QSE considers valid.\n(b)\tManual \u2013 Represents an analog or status entered manually at the Market Participant (i.e., not received from the field electronically).\n(c)\tCalculated \u2013 Represents an analog point that the TSP or QSE calculates.\n(d)\tSuspect \u2013 Represents an analog or status of which the TSP or QSE is unsure of the validity \n(e)\tInvalid \u2013 Represents an analog or status that the Market Participant has identified as out of reasonability limits.\n(f)\tCom_fail \u2013 Informs ERCOT that due to communications failure, the analog or status provided ERCOT is not current.\n3.10.7.5.8.2\tReliability of ICCP Associations\n(1)\tEach Market Participant using ICCP associations must achieve a monthly availability of 98%, excluding approved Planned Outages.  Availability shall be measured based on end-to-end connectivity of the communications path and the passing of configured data at the scheduled periodicity.  To meet the 98% monthly availability, each Market Participant should establish a process to coordinate downtime for ICCP associations and database maintenance.  High availability configuration as allowed by the ERCOT Nodal ICCP Communication Handbook should be treated as a single association to achieve this availability measure.  \n3.10.7.5.9\tERCOT Requests for Telemetry\n(1)\tERCOT is required to protect Transmission Facilities operated at 60 kV or above from damage.  To do this, ERCOT may request that additional telemetry be installed, while attempting to minimize adding equipment to as few locations as practicable.\n(2)\tERCOT may request additional telemetry when it determines that network observability or the measurement redundancy is not adequate to produce acceptable State Estimator results.\n(3)\tPrior to making a request for additional telemetry, ERCOT shall provide evidence supporting a congestion or reliability problem requiring additional observability and define expected improvements in ERCOT System observability needed.  If the request is for telemetry additions at more than one location, ERCOT shall prioritize the requested additions.\n(4)\tNo later than 60 days after receipt of a request for additional telemetry, the TSP or QSE shall:\n(a)\tAccept ERCOT\u2019s request for additional telemetry and notify ERCOT of the implementation schedule, which shall be no later than 18 months following the receipt of the request for additional telemetry;\n(b)\tProvide an alternative proposal to ERCOT, for implementation no later than 18 months following the receipt of the request for additional telemetry, that meets the requirements described by ERCOT;\n(c)\tPropose a normal topology change by changing normal status of switch(es) in the area that would eliminate the security violations that are ERCOT\u2019s concern; \n(d)\tIndicate that the requested telemetry point is at a location where the TSP or QSE does not have the authority to install the requested telemetry.  For points on privately owned facilities connected to the ERCOT Transmission Grid, an attempt will be made to facilitate ERCOT's telemetry request;\n(e)\tProvide ERCOT an analysis of the cost to comply with the request, so that, ERCOT can perform a cost justification with respect to the LMP market; or\n(f)\tIf the TSP or QSE disagrees with the request, the TSP or QSE may request that ERCOT withdraw its request for additional telemetry.  \n[NPRR979:  Replace paragraph (4) above with the following upon system implementation of NPRR857:]\n(4)\tNo later than 60 days after receipt of a request for additional telemetry, the TSP, DCTO, or QSE shall:\n(a)\tAccept ERCOT\u2019s request for additional telemetry and notify ERCOT of the implementation schedule, which shall be no later than 18 months following the receipt of the request for additional telemetry;\n(b)\tProvide an alternative proposal to ERCOT, for implementation no later than 18 months following the receipt of the request for additional telemetry, that meets the requirements described by ERCOT;\n(c)\tPropose a normal topology change by changing normal status of switch(es) in the area that would eliminate the security violations that are ERCOT\u2019s concern; \n(d)\tIndicate that the requested telemetry point is at a location where the TSP, DCTO, or QSE does not have the authority to install the requested telemetry.

If, after receiving an appeal, TAC does not resolve the appeal within 65 days, the TSP or QSE may present its appeal to the ERCOT Board.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a TSP or QSE is not required to provide telemetry measurements from a location not owned by that TSP or QSE if the location owner does not grant access to the TSP or QSE for the purpose of obtaining such measurements.  ERCOT shall report such cases to the IMM.\n[NPRR979:  Replace paragraph (5) above with the following upon system implementation of NPRR857:]\n(5)\tIf ERCOT rejects an alternative proposal pursuant to paragraph (4)(b), (c), or (f) above, the TSP, DCTO, or QSE may appeal the original request to TAC within 30 days of receiving notice of ERCOT\u2019s rejection.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a TSP, DCTO, or QSE is not required to provide telemetry measurements from a location not owned by that TSP, DCTO, or QSE if the location owner does not grant access to the TSP, DCTO, or QSE for the purpose of obtaining such measurements.  ERCOT shall report such cases to the IMM.\n3.10.7.5.10\tERCOT Requests for Redundant Telemetry\n(1)\tERCOT shall maintain redundancy on monitored non-Load substations.\n(2)\tERCOT shall identify new telemetry required to maintain N-1 observability on monitored non-Load substations.  The following conditions shall be used to determine what additional telemetry is required:\n(a)\tInability of ERCOT to monitor loading on a transmission line operated at 345 kV or above.\n(b)\tInability of ERCOT to monitor loading on a 345/138 kV autotransformer.\n(c)\tInability of ERCOT to monitor loading on Transmission Facilities designated as important to transmission reliability by ERCOT. \n(3)\tERCOT may request additional MW, MVAr and voltage telemetry to make these measurements redundant.  In this request, ERCOT shall identify these measurements, and the contingency/overload condition and the unit dispatch that makes this a concern.  If the request is for telemetry at multiple locations, ERCOT shall prioritize the requested additions.\n(4)\tExcept as provided in paragraph (5) below, no later than 60 days after receipt of a request for additional telemetry, a TSP or QSE shall:\n(a)\tAccept ERCOT\u2019s request for additional telemetry and notify ERCOT of the implementation schedule, which shall be no later than 18 months following the receipt of the request for additional telemetry; or\n(b)\tPropose an alternative solution that will serve the same purpose as the ERCOT identified telemetry additions, with a proposed implementation no later than 18 months following the receipt of the request for additional telemetry;\n(5)\tIn cases where the request is based on the availability rate of an existing telemetry point, no later than 30 days after receipt of a request for additional telemetry, the TSP or QSE shall:\n(a)\tProvide a plan to improve the availability rate of the identified telemetry to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(b)(i) of Section 3.10.7.5.4, General Telemetry Performance Criteria, and paragraph (3) of Section 3.10.7.5.5, Supplemental Telemetry Performance Criteria;\n(b)\tProvide documentation for why the improvements set forth in paragraph (a) above cannot be accomplished;\n(c)\tIdentify and propose a schedule of equipment installations or maintenance to be completed no later 18 months following the receipt of the request for additional telemetry that would, as a result, change the classification of the Transmission Element identified by ERCOT; or\n(d)\tIndicate that the facility for which telemetry is being requested is not owned or covered by an agreement that allows the requested party to install the additional telemetry.\n(6) \tIf ERCOT rejects an alternative solution proposed pursuant to paragraph (4) or (5) above, the TSP or QSE may appeal the original request to TAC within 30 days of receiving notice of ERCOT\u2019s rejection.  If, after receiving an appeal, TAC does not resolve the appeal within 65 days, the TSP or QSE may present its appeal to the ERCOT Board.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a TSP or QSE is not required to provide telemetry measurements from a location not owned by that TSP or QSE if the location owner does not grant access to the TSP or QSE for the purpose of obtaining such measurements.  ERCOT shall report such cases to the IMM.\n3.10.7.6\tUse of Generic Transmission Constraints and Generic Transmission Limits\n(1)\tFor the sole purpose of creating transmission flow constraints between areas of the ERCOT Transmission Grid in ERCOT applications that are unable to recognize non-thermal operating limits (such as system stability limits and voltage limits on Electrical Buses), ERCOT may create new Generic Transmission Constraints (GTCs) or modify existing GTCs for use in reliability and market analysis.  GTCs created or modified as described in this Section shall be used in the SCED application.  ERCOT shall not use GTCs in ERCOT applications to replace other constraints already capable of being directly modeled in the SCED application. \n(2) \tDuring the ERCOT quarterly stability assessment, performed pursuant to Planning Guide Section 5.3.5, ERCOT Quarterly Stability Assessment, if ERCOT determines a GTC is necessary for a new Generation Resource and SOTSG due to localized stability issues associated with the output of the interconnecting Generation Resource or SOTSG, the GTL for the GTC shall be set to the lowest non-zero limit for all system conditions outside those in which the limit is zero.\n[NPRR1246:  Replace paragraph (2) above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]\n(2)\tDuring the ERCOT quarterly stability assessment, performed pursuant to Planning Guide Section 5.3.5, ERCOT Quarterly Stability Assessment, if ERCOT determines a GTC is necessary for a new Generation Resource, ESR, or SOTSG due to localized stability issues associated with the output of the interconnecting Generation Resource, ESR, or SOTSG, the GTL for the GTC shall be set to the lowest non-zero limit for all system conditions outside those in which the limit is zero.\n(3)\tExcept as provided in paragraph (6) below, ERCOT shall post a description of each new or modified GTC to the MIS Secure Area as soon as possible, but no later than the day prior to the GTC or GTC modification becoming effective in any ERCOT application.  Posting of each new or modified GTC shall include:\n(a) \tThe description of the new or modified GTC including the GTL or description of the data and studies used to calculate the GTL associated with each new or modified GTC;\n(b)\tThe effective date of the new or modified GTC;\n(c)\tThe identity of all constrained Transmission Elements that make up the GTC, including the defined interface where applicable; and\n(d)\tDetailed information on the development of each GTC, including the defined constraint or interface where applicable; and data and studies used for development of each new or modified GTC, including the GTL associated with each new or modified GTC.  This information shall be redacted or omitted to protect the confidentiality of certain stability-related GTCs.\n(4)\tMarket Participants may review and comment on each new or modified GTC.  Within seven days following receipt of any comments, ERCOT shall post the comments to the MIS Secure Area as part of the information related to the subject GTC.  ERCOT shall review any comments and may modify any part of a given GTC in response to any comments received.\n(5)\tAnticipated GTLs, except those determined pursuant to paragraph (6) below, shall be posted to the MIS Secure Area no later than one day before the Operating Day. \n(6)\tIf an unexpected change to ERCOT System conditions requires the creation of a new GTC or the modification of an existing GTC to manage ERCOT System reliability, and the GTC has not been posted pursuant to paragraph (3) above, ERCOT shall issue an Operating Condition Notice (OCN) and post on the MIS Secure Area the new or modified GTC and its associated GTL(s), including the detailed information described in paragraphs (3) and (5) above.  ERCOT shall include an explanation regarding why it did not post the GTC or modification on the previous day.\n(7)\tNo later than 180 days after the effective date of a new GTC, ERCOT shall post a report listing alternatives for exiting the GTC to the MIS Secure Area.  The listed alternatives may include but are not limited to the implementation or modification of a RAS or a transmission improvement project.\n3.10.7.7\tDC Tie Limits\n(1) \tERCOT shall post DC Tie limits for each hour of the Operating Day to the MIS Secure Area no later than 0600 in the Day-Ahead before the Operating Day.  ERCOT may update these limits as system conditions change. \n(2)\tDC Tie limits shall be based on expected system conditions, including Outages, for each hour of the Operating Day and shall be calculated as the lower of the physical capacity of the DC Tie, the amount of DC Tie import and export that could flow without resulting in transmission security violations that would not be resolved by SCED, or, for the DC Ties with Mexico, any limits supplied by the Mexican system operator.  In setting these limits for a given hour, ERCOT shall assume that any Generation Resource shown to be available in its COP will be self-committed or committed at the appropriate time through the Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) process to resolve any transmission constraints resulting from DC Tie Schedules.  DC Tie Schedules are subject to the actual availability of that generation at the time the Generation Resource is needed, as well as other system conditions.\n[NPRR825 and NPRR1246:  Replace applicable portions of Section 3.10.7.7 above with the following upon system implementation for NPRR825; or upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project for NPRR1246:]\n3.10.7.7\tDC Tie Advisory Limits\n(1) \tEvery hour, ERCOT shall post DC Tie advisory limits for each hour of the next 48 hours to the MIS Secure Area.

Any updated DC Tie advisory limits shall be posted to the MIS Secure Area as soon as practicable.\n(2)\tDC Tie advisory limits shall be based on expected, or actual system conditions, including Outages, for each hour of the Operating Day and shall be calculated as the lower of the available physical capacity of the DC Tie, the amount of DC Tie import and export that could flow without resulting in transmission security violations that would not be resolved by SCED, or, for the DC Ties with Mexico, any limits supplied by the Mexican system operator.  In setting these limits for a given hour, ERCOT shall assume that any Generation Resource or ESR shown to be available in its COP for a given hour will be self-committed or committed at the appropriate time through the Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) process to resolve any transmission security violations resulting from DC Tie Schedules.  DC Tie Schedules are subject to the actual availability of that generation at the time the Generation Resource or ESR is needed, as well as other system conditions.\n3.10.8\tDynamic Ratings\n(1)\tERCOT shall use Dynamic Ratings, where available, in the Network Operations Model and the CRR Network Models.\n(2)\tERCOT shall use Dynamic Ratings in place of the Normal Rating, Emergency Rating and 15-Minute Rating as applicable as provided under paragraphs (a) or (b) below for Transmission Elements established in the Network Operations Model.  \n(a)\tA TSP may provide Dynamic Ratings via ICCP for implementation in the next Operating Hour.  ERCOT shall use the Dynamic Ratings in its Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) alarming, Real Time Security Analysis, and SCED process.  In addition, the TSP shall provide ERCOT with a table of equipment rating versus temperature for use in operational planning studies.\n(b)\tEach TSP may alternatively elect to provide ERCOT with a table of equipment rating versus temperature and a temperature value in Real-Time for each Weather Zone in which the Transmission Element is located.  ERCOT shall apply the table of temperature and rating relationships and ERCOT\u2019s current temperature measurements to determine the rating of each such designated piece of equipment for each Operating Hour.  ERCOT shall use the TSP-provided table in operational planning studies.\n(3)\tEach Operating Hour, ERCOT shall post on the MIS Secure Area updated Dynamic Ratings adjusted for the current temperature.\n(4)\tERCOT may request that a TSP submit temperature-adjusted ratings on Transmission Elements that ERCOT identifies as contributing to significant congestion costs.  Each TSP shall provide the additional ratings within two months of such a request using one of the two mechanisms for supplying temperature-adjusted ratings identified above.  Ratings for Transmission Elements operated by multiple TSPs must be supplied by each TSP that has control.  ERCOT shall use the most limiting rating and report the circumstance to the IMM.\n3.10.8.1\tDynamic Ratings Delivered via ICCP\n(1)\tThe TSP shall supply the following, via ICCP, updated at least every ten minutes:\n(a)\tNormal Rating; and\n(b)\tOptionally Emergency Rating and/or 15-Minute Rating (required when Emergency Rating is provided).\n(2)\tERCOT shall link each provided line rating with the ERCOT Network Operations Model and implement the ratings for the next Operating Hour.  ERCOT shall use the Dynamic Ratings in its SCADA alarming, real-time Security Analysis, and SCED process.  When the telemetry is not operational, ERCOT shall use a temperature appropriate for current conditions, and employ the required Dynamic Rating lookup table to determine the appropriate rating. \n3.10.8.2\tDynamic Ratings Delivered via Static Table and Telemetered Temperature\n(1)\tERCOT shall define a set of tables implementing the dynamic characteristics provided by the TSP(s) and as applicable, Resource Entity(s), of selected transmission lines, including:\n(a)\tLine ID;\n(b)\tFrom station;\n(c)\tTo station;\n(d)\tWeather Zone(s);\n(e)\tTSP(s) and Resource Entity(s); and\n(f)\tEach of the three ratings: Normal Rating, Emergency Rating, and 15-Minute Rating.\n(2)\tIf a TSP is providing a current temperature for each applicable Weather Zone through SCADA telemetry then ERCOT shall determine the appropriate rating based upon the telemetered temperature, and adjust the Normal Rating, Emergency Rating, and 15-Minute Rating within five minutes of receipt for the next Operating Hour.  ERCOT shall use the Dynamic Ratings in its SCADA alarming, real-time Security Analysis, and SCED process.    \n3.10.8.3\tDynamic Rating Network Operations Model Change Requests\n(1)\tERCOT shall use the NOMCR process by which TSPs provide electronically to ERCOT the dynamic rating table described in Section 3.10.8.2, Dynamic Ratings Delivered via Static Table and Telemetered Temperature.   \n3.10.8.4\tERCOT Responsibilities Related to Dynamic Ratings\n(1)\tERCOT shall provide a system to accept and implement Dynamic Ratings or temperatures to be applied to rating tables for each hour in the Day-Ahead and in the Operating Hour.

The posting will include the Transmission Element name, approved thermal rating limits, and the planned effective date; and\n(e)\tImplement the approved Dynamic Rating automatically within 24 hours of approval.  \n(2)\tERCOT shall provide a system to implement Dynamic Ratings and to obtain monthly expected ambient air temperatures to be applied to rating tables for the CRR Network Models. Temperatures applied to the rating tables shall be determined using the same method as described in item (3)(f) of Section 7.5.5.4, Simultaneous Feasibility Test.  Transmission Elements that have Dynamic Ratings implemented in the Network Operations Model must have Dynamic Ratings in the CRR Network Models.\n(3)\tERCOT shall identify additional Transmission Elements that have a high probability of providing significant added economic efficiency to the ERCOT market through Dynamic Rating and request such Dynamic Ratings from the associated TSP.  ERCOT shall post annually the list of the Transmission Elements and identify if the TSP has agreed to provide the rating on the MIS Secure Area.\n3.10.8.5\tTransmission Service Provider Responsibilities Related to Dynamic Ratings\n(1)\tEach TSP shall:\n(a)\tProvide ERCOT with tables of ratings for different ambient temperatures for Transmission Elements, as requested by ERCOT.\n(b)\tSubmit within two months a temperature adjusted rating table when a request is received from ERCOT unless multiple requests are made by ERCOT within the two-month period or unusual circumstances prevent the request from being accommodated in a timely fashion.  Such circumstances must be explained to ERCOT in writing and must be posted by ERCOT on the MIS Secure Area within five Business Days of receipt.\n(c)\tProvide Real-Time temperatures for each Weather Zone in which the TSP has existing dynamically rated transmission equipment, or alternatively provide rating updates for each temperature-adjusted line rating updated at least once every ten minutes.\n3.10.9\tState Estimator Requirements\n(1)\tThe appropriate TAC subcommittee shall coordinate with Market Participants to ensure a common understanding of the level of State Estimator performance required to enable LMP calculation and address the State Estimator\u2019s ability to detect, correct, or otherwise accommodate communications system failures, failed data points, stale data condition codes, and missing or inaccurate measurements to the extent these capabilities contribute to LMP accuracy and State Estimator performance or as needed to meet reliability requirements.\n3.10.9.1\tConsiderations for State Estimator Requirements\n(1)\tIn maintaining the State Estimator requirements, the following may be considered:\n(a)\tDesired confidence levels of State Estimator results;\n(b)\tMeasurement requirements to estimate power injections and withdrawals at transmission voltage Electrical Buses defined in the SCED transmission model, which may provide for variations in criteria based on:\n(i)\tThe number of Transmission Elements connected to a given transmission voltage Electrical Bus;\n(ii)\tThe peak demand of the Load connected to a transmission voltage Electrical Bus;\n(iii)\tThe total of Resource capacity connected to a transmission voltage Electrical Bus;\n(iv)\tThe nominal transmission voltage level of an Electrical Bus;\n(v)\tThe number of Electrical Buses with injections or withdrawals along a circuit between currently monitored transmission voltage Electrical Bus;\n(vi)\tConnection of Loads along a continuous, non-branching circuit that may be combined for modeling purposes;\n(vii)\tThe quantity of Load at an Electrical Bus that may have its connection to the transmission system automatically transferred to an Electrical Bus other than the one to which it is normally connected (rollover operation);\n(vii)\tElectrical proximity to more than one Resource Node;\n(viii)\tDegree or quality of continued observability following the loss of telemetry measurements resulting from a common mode failure of telemetry-related equipment (i.e., an N-1 telemetry condition); and\n(ix)\tOther parameters or circumstances, as appropriate;\n(c)\tSensitivity of State Estimator results with respect to variations in input parameters;\n(d)\tReasonable safeguards to assure State Estimator results are calculated on a non-discriminatory basis; and\n(e)\tOther parameters as deemed appropriate.\n3.10.9.2\tState Estimator Data\n(1)\tERCOT uses a State Estimator to produce Load flow base cases, which are used to analyze the reliability of the ERCOT Transmission Grid.  Accurate and redundant telemetry and an accurate transmission power system model are required by the State Estimator in order to produce an optimal estimation of the transmission power system state.  State Estimator results are used in contingency analysis, congestion management, and other network analysis Real-Time sequence functions.\n3.10.9.3\tTelemetry Status and Analog Measurements Data\n(1)\tGood telemetry status and analog measurements data for the transmission power system together with an accurate model of the ERCOT System are processed by the State Estimator to provide an optimal estimate of the ERCOT System state at a given point in time while filtering minor measurement errors and detecting gross errors.  The quality and availability of telemetry provided to ERCOT is important to the performance of the ERCOT State Estimator.\n(2)\tTelemetry is not needed at every node of the ERCOT System to arrive at a good estimate of the ERCOT System\u2019s state. State Estimator performance must meet the performance requirements set forth in Section 3.10.9.4, State Estimator Performance Requirements, unless otherwise provided for in the Operating Guides.\n(3)\tBeyond general telemetry performance criteria there are more stringent criteria needed at locations where state estimates are critically important, including, but not limited to, locations where reliability, security, and market impacts are of heightened concern.\n3.10.9.4\tState Estimator Performance Requirements\n(1)\tThe State Estimator shall converge 98% of runs during a one month period.\n(2)\tFor MW flows on Transmission Elements identified by ERCOT as causing 80% of congestion costs in the latest year for which data is available, the residual difference between State Estimator results and power flow results shall be less than 3% of the associated element Emergency Rating on at least 95% of samples measured in a one month period.  \n(3)\tFor Transmission Elements identified by ERCOT as causing 80% of all congestion costs in the latest year for which data is available, the difference between the telemetry value (MW) and the State Estimator value (MW) shall be less than 3% of the associated element Emergency Rating on at least 95% of samples measured in a one month period. \n(4)\tFor the 20 most important station voltage points, as designated by ERCOT and approved by ROS, the telemetered voltage minus State Estimator voltage shall be within 2% of the telemetered voltage measurement for at least 95% of samples measured during a one month period.  \n(5)\tFor all Transmission Elements 100 kV and above, the difference between the State Estimator solution (MW) and the SCADA measurement will be less than ten MW or 10% of the associated Emergency Rating (whichever is greater) on 99.5% of samples measured during a one month period.  ERCOT shall report all equipment failing this test to the associated TSP who shall repair such equipment no later than ten days following detection by ERCOT.\n(6)\tERCOT shall post the State Estimator performance requirements contained in this Section on the MIS Secure Area.\n3.10.9.5\tERCOT Directives\n(1)\tERCOT shall work with the TSP or QSE to resolve telemetry and/or model problems in accordance with telemetry requirements prior to directing additional equipment.\n(2)\tIn the event of failure to meet the requirements in paragraphs (2) or (3) of Section 3.10.9.4, State Estimator Performance Requirements, ERCOT may direct additional telemetry to be installed on elements contributing most to 80% of congestion costs for the latest year for which data is available.  If the TSP or QSE disputes the request for additional telemetry, pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 3.10.7.5.9, ERCOT Requests for Telemetry, the TSP or QSE may provide an alternative proposal.\n(3)\tERCOT shall enforce the requirements of paragraph (5) of Section 3.10.7.5.2, Continuous Telemetry of the Real-Time Measurements of Bus Load, Voltages, Tap Position, and Flows, by alarming any sum of flow around a bus that is more than (a) 5% of the largest normal line rating connected to the bus, or (b) five MW, whichever is greater, and requesting that the applicable TSP or QSE correct the failure.\n(4)\tERCOT shall consider the quality codes sent by the data provider in determining how confidence factors are assigned for the data to be used in the State Estimator.  Valid and manual quality codes as defined in Section 3.10.7.5.8.1, Data Quality Codes, shall be considered as good quality.  Quality codes sent as not good quality shall be considered at a lower confidence.\n3.10.9.6\tTelemetry and State Estimator Performance Monitoring\n(1)\tERCOT shall monitor the performance of the State Estimator, Network Security Analysis, SCED, and LMP Calculator.  ERCOT shall post a monthly report of these items on the MIS Secure Area.  ERCOT shall notify affected TSPs and QSEs of any lapses of observability of the transmission system.\n[NPRR857 and NPRR1240:  Replace applicable portions of paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation and satisfying the following conditions:  (1) Southern Cross provides ERCOT with funds to cover the entire estimated cost of the project; and (2) Southern Cross has signed an interconnection agreement with a TSP and the TSP gives ERCOT written notice that Southern Cross has provided it with:  (a) Notice to proceed with the construction of the interconnection; and (b) The financial security required to fund the interconnection facilities for NPRR857; or upon system implementation for NPRR1240:]\n(1)\tERCOT shall monitor the performance of the State Estimator, Network Security Analysis, SCED, and LMP Calculator.  ERCOT shall post a monthly report of these items on the MIS Secure Area, except for reports of State Estimator convergence rates that ERCOT shall post on the ERCOT website.  ERCOT shall notify affected TSPs, QSEs, or DCTOs of any lapses of observability of the transmission system.\n3.11\tTransmission Planning\n3.11.1\tOverview\n(1)\tProject endorsement through the ERCOT regional planning process is intended to support, to the extent applicable, a finding by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) that a project is necessary for the service, accommodation, convenience, or safety of the public within the meaning of Public Utility Regulatory Act, TEX. UTIL. CODE ANN. \u00a7 37.056 (Vernon 1998 and Supp. 2007) (PURA) and P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.101, Certification Criteria. \n3.11.2\tPlanning Criteria\n(1)\tERCOT and Transmission Service Providers (TSPs) shall evaluate the need for transmission system improvements and shall evaluate the relative value of alternative improvements based on established technical and economic criteria. \n(2)\tThe technical reliability criteria are established by the Planning Guide, Operating Guides, and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards.  ERCOT and TSPs shall strongly endeavor to meet these criteria, identify current and future violations thereof and initiate solutions necessary to ensure continual compliance.\n(3)\tERCOT shall attempt to meet these reliability criteria as economically as possible and shall actively study the need for economic projects to meet this goal.  \n(4)\tFor economic projects, the net economic benefit of a proposed project, or set of projects, will be assessed over the project\u2019s life based on the net benefit that is reasonably expected to accrue from the project as demonstrated through the production cost savings test or the congestion cost savings test.  The current set of financial assumptions upon which the revenue requirement calculations for these tests are based will be reviewed annually, updated as necessary by ERCOT, and posted on the ERCOT website.  The expected economic benefits are based on chronological simulations of the security-constrained unit commitment and economic dispatch of the generators connected to the ERCOT Transmission Grid to serve the expected ERCOT System Load over the planning horizon, comparing simulations with and without the project.  These market simulations are intended to provide a reasonable representation of how the ERCOT System is expected to be operated over the simulated time period.  From a practical standpoint, it is not feasible to perform these simulations for the entire 30 to 40 year expected life of the project.  Therefore, the economic benefits are projected over the period for which simulations are feasible, which is the planning horizon established in Planning Guide Section 3.1.1.2, Regional Transmission Plan, and a qualitative assessment is made of whether the factors driving the economic benefits due to the project can reasonably be expected to continue.  \n(5)\tTo determine the economic benefits of a proposed project under the production cost savings test, the revenue requirement of the capital cost of the project is compared to the expected savings in system production costs resulting from the project over the expected life of the project.  Outputs from the market simulations described in paragraph (4) above will be used to provide an estimate of the expected reduction in total system-wide production cost due to the project.  Other adequately quantifiable and ongoing direct and indirect costs and benefits to the transmission system attributable to the project may be considered as appropriate.  If the levelized ERCOT-wide annual production cost savings equals or exceeds the first-year annual revenue requirement of the transmission project, the project will be deemed to demonstrate sufficient economic benefit and will be recommended.  ERCOT will publish requested non-confidential modeling inputs, assumptions, and outputs utilized in the production cost savings test if that information can be feasibly provided.\n(6)\tTo determine the economic benefits of a proposed project under the congestion cost savings test, the revenue requirement of the capital cost of the project is compared to the expected system-wide consumer energy cost reduction resulting from the project over the expected life of the project.  Outputs from the market simulations described in paragraph (4) above will be used to provide an estimate of the expected reduction in total system-wide consumer energy cost due to the project.  In the market simulations, system-wide consumer energy cost will be calculated using hourly load in MWh multiplied by hourly load nodal energy prices in $/MWh.  Other adequately quantifiable and ongoing direct and indirect costs and benefits to the transmission system attributable to the project may be considered as appropriate.  If the levelized system-wide consumer energy cost reduction equals or exceeds the average of the first three years\u2019 annual revenue requirement for the project, the project will be deemed to demonstrate sufficient economic benefit and will be recommended.  ERCOT will publish requested non-confidential modeling inputs, assumptions, and outputs utilized in the congestion cost savings test if that information can be feasibly provided.\n3.11.3\tRegional Planning Group\n(1)\tERCOT shall lead and facilitate a Regional Planning Group (RPG) to consider and review proposed projects to address transmission constraints and other ERCOT System needs.  The RPG will be a non-voting, consensus-based organization focused on identifying needs, identifying potential solutions, communicating varying viewpoints and reviewing analyses related to the ERCOT Transmission Grid in the planning horizon.  Participation in the RPG is required of all TSPs and is open to all Market Participants, consumers, other stakeholders, and PUCT Staff.  \n3.11.4\tRegional Planning Group Project Review Process\n3.11.4.1\tProject Submission\n(1)\tAny stakeholder may initiate an RPG Project Review through the submission of a document describing the scope of the proposed transmission project to ERCOT.  Projects should be submitted with sufficient lead-time to allow the RPG Project Review to be completed prior to the date on which the project must be initiated by the designated TSP.  \n(2)\tStakeholders may submit projects for RPG Project Review within any project Tier.  All transmission projects in Tiers 1, 2 and 3 shall be submitted.  TSPs are not required to submit Tier 4 projects for RPG Project Review, but shall include any Tier 4 projects in the cases used for development of the Regional Transmission Plan. \n(3)\tAll system improvements that are necessary for the project to achieve the system performance improvement, or to correct the system performance deficiency, for which the project is intended should be included into a single project submission.\n(4) \tFacility ratings updates are not considered a project and are not subject to RPG Project Review.\n3.11.4.1.1\tProject Submissions Based on Unsubstantiated Load\n(1)\tFollowing the submission of a project by a TSP, if ERCOT determines that the asserted need for a Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3 project is based in part or in whole on Unsubstantiated Load, ERCOT shall notify the submitting TSP and the RPG, and neither ERCOT nor the RPG will conduct any further review of the project.\n3.11.4.2\tProject Comment Process\n(1)\tERCOT shall conduct a comment process which is open to the stakeholders for all proposed Tier 1, 2 and 3 projects.  The proposer of the project will have a reasonable period of time, as established by ERCOT, to answer questions and respond to comments submitted during this process.  The Planning Guide provides details of this process. \n3.11.4.3\tCategorization of Proposed Transmission Projects\n(1)\tERCOT classifies all proposed transmission projects into one of four categories (or Tiers).  Each Tier is defined so that projects with a similar cost and impact on reliability and the ERCOT market are grouped into the same Tier.  For Tier classification, the total estimated cost of the project shall be used which includes costs borne by another party.\n(a) \tA project shall be classified as Tier 1 if the estimated capital cost is greater than or equal to $100,000,000, unless the project is considered to be a neutral project pursuant to paragraph (f) below.\n(b)\tA project shall be classified as Tier 2 if the estimated capital cost is less than $100,000,000 and a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN) is required, unless the project is considered to be a neutral project pursuant to paragraph (f) below.\n(c)\tA project shall be classified as Tier 3 if any of the following are true:\n(i)\tThe estimated capital cost is less than $100,000,000 and greater than or equal to $25,000,000 and a CCN is not required, unless the project is considered to be a neutral project pursuant to paragraph (f) below; or\n(ii)\tThe estimated capital cost is less than $25,000,000, a CCN is not required, and the project includes 345 kV circuit reconductor of more than one mile, additional 345/138 kV autotransformer capacity, or a new 345 kV substation, unless the project is considered to be a neutral project pursuant to paragraph (f) below.\n(d)\tA project with an estimated capital cost greater than or equal to $25,000,000 that is proposed for the purpose of replacing aged infrastructure or storm hardening shall be processed as a Tier 3 project and shall be reclassified as a Tier 4, neutral project upon ERCOT\u2019s determination that any concerns, questions or objections raised during the comment process have been resolved satisfactorily.\n(e)\tA project shall be classified as Tier 4 if it does not meet the requirements to be classified as Tier 1, 2, or 3 or if it is considered a neutral project pursuant to paragraph (f) below.\n(f)\tA project shall be considered a neutral project if it consists entirely of:\n(i)\tThe addition of or upgrades to radial transmission circuits; \n(ii)\tThe addition of equipment that does not affect the transfer capability of a circuit;\n(iii)\tRepair and replacement-in-kind projects; \n(iv)\tTransmission Facilities needed to connect a new Generation Resource, Energy Storage Resource (ESR), or Settlement Only Generator (SOG) to a new or existing substation on the existing ERCOT Transmission Grid, including the substation; \n(v)\tThe addition of static reactive devices; \n(vi)\tA project to serve a new Load, unless such project would create a new transmission circuit connection between two stations (other than looping an existing circuit into the new Load-serving station);\n(vii)\tReplacement of failed equipment, even if it results in a ratings and/or impedance change; or\n(viii)\tEquipment upgrades resulting in only ratings changes.\n(2)\tERCOT may use its reasonable judgment to increase the level of review of a proposed project (e.g., from Tier 3 to Tier 2) from that which would be strictly indicated by these criteria, based on stakeholder comments, ERCOT analysis or the system impacts of the project.\n(a) \tA project with an estimated capital cost greater than or equal to $50,000,000 that requires a CCN shall be reclassified and processed as a Tier 1 project upon request by a Market Participant during the comment period per Planning Guide Section 3.1.5, Regional Planning Group Comment Process.\n(3)\tAny project that would be built by an Entity that is exempt (e.g., a Municipally Owned Utility (MOU)) from getting a CCN for transmission projects but would require a CCN if it were to be built by a regulated Entity will be treated as if the project would require a CCN for the purpose of defining the Tier of the project.\n(4)\tIf during the course of ERCOT\u2019s independent review of a project, the project scope changes, ERCOT may reclassify the project into the appropriate Tier.\n3.11.4.4\tProcessing of Tier 4 Projects\n(1)\tFor any project classified in Tier 4, ERCOT will not solicit comments from RPG, conduct any independent review, or provide any endorsement for the project. \n3.11.4.5\tProcessing of Tier 3 Projects\n(1)\tERCOT shall accept a Tier 3 project if no concerns, questions or objections are provided during the project comment process.\n(2)\tIf reasonable ERCOT or stakeholder concerns about a Tier 3 project cannot be resolved during the time period allotted by ERCOT, the project may be processed as a Tier 2 project, unless ERCOT assesses that reasonable progress is being made toward resolving these concerns.\n3.11.4.6\tProcessing of Tier 2 Projects\n(1)\tERCOT shall conduct an independent review of a submitted Tier 2 project as follows:\n(a)\tERCOT\u2019s independent review shall consist of studies and analyses necessary for ERCOT to make its assessment of whether the proposed project is needed and whether the proposed project is the preferred solution to the identified system performance deficiency that the project is intended to resolve;\n(b)\tERCOT shall consider all comments received during the project comment process and factor reasonable comments into its independent review of the project;\n(c)\tERCOT will attempt to complete its independent review for a project in 120 days or less.  If ERCOT is unable to complete its independent review based on RPG input within 120 days, ERCOT shall notify the RPG of the expected completion time;\n(d)\tERCOT may, at its discretion, discuss submitted transmission projects at meetings of the RPG in order to obtain additional input into its independent review; and\n(e)\tERCOT shall prepare a written report documenting the results of its independent review and recommendation on the project and shall distribute this report to the RPG.\n3.11.4.7\tProcessing of Tier 1 Projects\n(1)\tERCOT shall conduct an independent review of a submitted Tier 1 project as follows:\n(a)\tERCOT\u2019s independent review will consist of studies and analyses necessary for ERCOT to make its assessment of whether the proposed project is needed and whether the proposed project is the preferred solution to the identified system performance deficiency that the project is intended to resolve;\n(b)\tERCOT will consider all comments received during the project comment process and factor reasonable comments into its independent review of the project;\n(c)\tERCOT will attempt to complete its independent review for a project in 150 days or less.  If ERCOT is unable to complete its independent review based on RPG input within 150 days, ERCOT shall notify the RPG of the expected completion time;\n(d)\tERCOT may, at its discretion, discuss submitted transmission projects at meetings of the RPG in order to obtain additional input into its independent review; and\n(e)\tERCOT shall prepare a written report documenting the results of its independent review and recommendation on the project and shall distribute this report to the RPG.\n(2)\tTier 1 projects require ERCOT Board endorsement.\n3.11.4.8\tDetermine Designated Providers of Transmission Additions\n(1)\tUpon completion of an independent review, ERCOT shall determine the designated TSPs for any recommended transmission additions.  The designated TSP for a recommended transmission addition will be the TSP that owns the end point(s) of the recommended transmission addition.  The designated TSP can agree to provide the recommended transmission addition or delegate the responsibility to another TSP.  If different TSPs own the two end points of a recommended transmission addition, ERCOT will designate them as co-providers of the recommended transmission addition, and they can decide between themselves what parts of the recommended transmission addition they will each provide.  If they cannot agree, ERCOT will determine their responsibility following a meeting with the parties.  If a designated TSP agrees to provide a recommended transmission addition but does not diligently pursue the recommended transmission addition (during the time frame before a CCN is filed, if required) in a manner that will meet the required in-service date, then upon concurrence of the ERCOT Board, ERCOT will solicit interest from TSPs through the RPG and will designate an alternate TSP.\n3.11.4.9\tRegional Planning Group Acceptance and ERCOT Endorsement\n(1)\tFor Tier 3 projects, successful resolution of all comments received from ERCOT and stakeholders during the project comment process will result in RPG acceptance of the proposed project.  An RPG acceptance letter shall be sent to the TSP(s) for the project, the project submitter (if different from the TSP(s)), and posted on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area.  For Tier 2 projects, ERCOT\u2019s recommendation as a result of its independent review of the proposed project will constitute ERCOT endorsement of the need for a project except as noted in paragraph (3) below.  For Tier 1 projects, ERCOT\u2019s endorsement is obtained upon affirmative vote of the ERCOT Board except as noted in paragraph (3) below.  An ERCOT endorsement letter shall be sent to the TSP(s) for the project, the project submitter (if different from the TSP(s)), and the PUCT, and posted on the MIS Secure Area upon receipt of ERCOT\u2019s endorsement for Tier 1 and Tier 2 projects except as noted in paragraph (3) below.\n(2)\tFollowing the completion of its independent review, ERCOT shall present all Tier 1 projects for which it finds a need to the ERCOT Board and shall provide a report to the ERCOT Board explaining the basis for its determination of need.  Prior to presenting the project to the ERCOT Board, ERCOT shall present the project to the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) for review and comment.  Comments from TAC shall be included in the presentation to the ERCOT Board.  ERCOT will make a reasonable effort to make these presentations to TAC and the ERCOT Board at the next regularly scheduled meetings following completion of its independent review of the project.\n(3)\tIf a TSP asserts a need for a proposed Tier 1 or Tier 2 project based in part or in whole on its own planning criteria, then ERCOT\u2019s independent review shall also consider whether a reliability need exists under the TSP\u2019s criteria.  If ERCOT identifies a reliability need under the TSP\u2019s criteria, then ERCOT shall recommend a project that would address that need as well as any reliability need identified under NERC or ERCOT criteria, but shall explicitly state in the independent review report that ERCOT has assumed the TSP\u2019s criteria are valid and that an assessment of the validity of the TSP\u2019s criteria is beyond the scope of ERCOT\u2019s responsibility.  ERCOT or the ERCOT Board may provide a qualified endorsement of such a project if ERCOT determines that it is justified in part under ERCOT or NERC criteria, as described in paragraph (1) above.  However, neither ERCOT nor the ERCOT Board shall endorse a project that is determined to be needed solely to meet a TSP\u2019s criteria.\n3.11.4.10\tModifications to ERCOT Endorsed Projects\n(1)\tIf the TSP for an ERCOT-endorsed project determines a need to make a significant change to the facilities included in the project (such as the line endpoint(s), number of circuits, voltage level, decrease in rating or similar major aspect of the project), the TSP shall notify ERCOT of the details of that change prior to filing a CCN application, if required, or prior to beginning the final design of the project if no CCN application is required.  If ERCOT concurs that the proposed change is significant, the change shall be processed as a Tier 3 project, unless ERCOT determines the project should more appropriately be processed in another Tier.\n(2) \tFor economic-driven projects, if a TSP determines that the estimated project cost has increased by more than 10% over the cost described in ERCOT\u2019s endorsement, the TSP shall notify RPG prior to filing a CCN application if required, or prior to beginning the final design of the project if no CCN application is required, and provide an explanation for the cost increase.  For comparison purposes, the cost of the route that best meets PUCT criteria will be used.\n3.11.4.11\tCustomer or Resource Entity Funded Transmission Projects\n(1)       If an affected TSP elects to pursue a Customer or Resource Entity funded transmission project that would have been classified as a Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3 project for RPG Project Review, the TSP(s) shall conduct a reliability impact assessment of the proposed transmission project and shall submit a report summarizing the results of the reliability impact assessment for RPG Project Review.  Such projects shall be processed according to their Tier classification and shall be reclassified as a Tier 4, neutral project upon ERCOT\u2019s determination that any concerns, questions or objections raised during the comment process have been resolved satisfactorily. \n(2)\tERCOT\u2019s independent review of a Tier 1 or Tier 2 Customer or Resource Entity funded transmission project will be limited to assessing the reliability and congestion impact of the proposed project and submitting a report summarizing the results and findings to RPG for review and discussion.  ERCOT will not endorse the project and will not present the project to the ERCOT Board.  However, ERCOT may recommend the project not be implemented or recommend changes to the project scope if, in ERCOT\u2019s sole discretion, the project negatively impacts the reliability or congestion of the ERCOT System.\n(3)\tCustomer or Resource Entity funded Tier 4 projects do not need to go through this review process.\n3.11.5\tTransmission Service Provider and Distribution Service Provider Access to Interval Data\n(1)\tERCOT shall provide specific interval data for Load and generation to TSPs and/or Distribution Service Providers (DSPs), upon request, in accordance with confidentiality as defined in Section 1.3, Confidentiality.\n(a)\tThe TSP\u2019s and/or DSP\u2019s request for interval data shall identify the reason for requesting the information in regards to impact to the planning process (e.g. build power flow cases, conduct a specific study, etc.).\n(b)\tERCOT shall evaluate the TSP and/or DSP request and validate reasons provided. \n(c)\tUpon ERCOT validation of the TSP and/or DSP request, the data provided shall include meter data measured at points of injection and points of delivery which will measurably impact the TSP\u2019s and/or DSP\u2019s planning and operations as determined by ERCOT (e.g., determination of the TSP\u2019s and/or DSP\u2019s system Load or power flows). \n(d) \tIf ERCOT determines that the request is invalid and denies it, ERCOT shall provide the reasoning for denying the request.\n3.11.6\tGeneration Interconnection Process\n(1)\tThe generation interconnection process facilitates the interconnection of new generation units in the ERCOT Region by assessing the transmission upgrades necessary for new generating units to operate reliably.  The process to study interconnecting new generation or modifying an existing generation interconnection to the ERCOT Transmission Grid is covered in the Planning Guide.  The generation interconnection study process primarily addresses the direct connection of generation Facilities to the ERCOT Transmission Grid and directly-related projects.  Projects that are identified through this process and are regional in nature may be reviewed through the RPG Project Review process upon recommendation by the TSP or ERCOT, subject to the confidentiality provisions in Section 1.3, Confidentiality.\n(2)\tERCOT shall perform an independent economic analysis of the Transmission Facilities needed to connect a new Generation Resource, ESR, or SOG to a new or existing substation on the existing ERCOT Transmission Grid, including the substation, that are identified through this process that are expected to cost more than $25,000,000.  This economic analysis is performed only for informational purposes; as such, no ERCOT endorsement will be provided.  The results of the economic analysis shall be included in the interconnection study posting.\n(3)\tAdditional upgrades to the ERCOT Transmission Grid that might be cost-effective as a result of new or modified generation may be initiated by any stakeholder through the RPG Project Review procedure described in Section 3.11.4, Regional Planning Group Project Review Process, at the appropriate time, subject to the confidentiality provisions of the generation interconnection procedure.\n3.12\tLoad Forecasting\n(1)\tERCOT shall produce and use Load forecasts to serve operations and planning objectives.  \n(a)\tERCOT shall update and post hourly on the ERCOT website, a \u201cSeven-Day Load Forecast\u201d as described in Section 3.12.1, Seven-Day Load Forecast, that provides forecasted hourly Load over the next 168 hours for each of the Weather Zones and for each of the Forecast Zones.  \n(b)\tERCOT shall develop and post monthly on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area a \u201c36-Month Load Forecast\u201d that provides a daily minimum and maximum Load forecast for the next 36 months for the ERCOT Region, for each of the Weather Zones, and for each of the Forecast Zones.  The 36-Month Load Forecast is used in the Outage coordination process and for Resource adequacy reporting.\n[NPRR1240:  Replace paragraph (b) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(b)\tERCOT shall develop and post monthly on the ERCOT website a \u201c36-Month Load Forecast\u201d that provides a daily minimum and maximum Load forecast for the next 36 months for the ERCOT Region, for each of the Weather Zones, and for each of the Forecast Zones.

Private Use Network Loads will be generated separately.  If ERCOT decides, in its sole discretion, to change the Load distribution factors for reasons such as anticipated weather events or holidays, ERCOT shall select representative conditions as an input reasonably reflecting the anticipated Load in the Operating Day.  ERCOT may also modify the Load distribution factors to account for predicted differences in network topology between the Load forecast and Operating Day.  ERCOT may set auto error correction settings and apply Load forecast validation to better represent Load Profiles.  Private Use Network Load distribution factor data is redacted from the ERCOT website postings and all self-serve Load\u2019s distribution factors are set to zero when the data is used by the downstream applications.\n(2)\tERCOT shall produce and post to the ERCOT website an Intra-Hour Load Forecast (IHLF) that provides a rolling two hour five minute forecast of ERCOT-wide Load.\n3.12.1\tSeven-Day Load Forecast\n(1)\tERCOT shall use the Seven-Day Load Forecast to predict hourly Loads for the next 168 hours based on current weather forecast parameters within each Weather Zone.  Preparation for Day-Ahead Operations requires an accurate forecast of the Loads for which generation capacity must be secured.  The Seven-Day Load Forecast must have a \u201cself-training\u201d mode that allows ERCOT to review historic Load data and provide the ability to retrain the Seven-Day Load Forecast algorithm.\n[NPRR975:  Insert paragraphs (a) and (b) below upon system implementation:]\n(a) \tERCOT will use a variety of Load forecast models and will select the Load forecast model that best fits the expected conditions for each hour of the next 168 hours as the Seven-Day Load Forecast for that hour and may update this selection as expected conditions change.    \n(b)\tIf the selected forecast used at the time of the Day-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (DRUC) for the peak Demand hour of any of the next seven days is above or below the average of the forecast models for that hour by the greater of 2000 MW or 4% of the average of the forecast models for that hour, ERCOT shall produce and post to the ERCOT website an explanation of why the outlier Load forecast model was selected for that hour.\n(2)\tThe inputs for the Seven-Day Load Forecast are as follows:\n(a)\tHourly forecasted weather parameters for the weather stations within the Weather Zones, which are updated at least once per hour; and\n(b)\tTraining information based on historic hourly integrated Weather Zone Loads.\n(3)\tERCOT shall review the forecast suggested by Seven-Day Load Forecast and shall use its judgment, if necessary, to modify the result prior to implementation in the Ancillary Service Capacity Monitor, Day-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (DRUC), Hour-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (HRUC), and Resource adequacy reporting.\n3.12.2\tStudy Areas\n(1)\tERCOT shall develop and use Study Areas for Load forecasting and study purposes, and will provide the Load forecast data to the market.

ERCOT shall produce the forecasts using information provided by WGR/PVGR Entities, meteorological information, and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA).  WGR and PVGR Entities shall install telemetry at their respective Resources and transmit the ERCOT-specified site-specific meteorological information to ERCOT.  WGR and PVGR Entities shall also provide detailed equipment status at the WGR/PVGR facility as specified by ERCOT to support the RPP forecast.  ERCOT shall post forecasts for each WGR and PVGR to the Qualified Scheduling Entities (QSEs) representing WGRs and/or PVGRs on the Market Information System (MIS) Certified Area.  QSEs shall use the ERCOT-provided forecasts for WGRs/PVGRs throughout the Day-Ahead and Operating Day for applicable markets and Reliability Unit Commitments (RUCs).  Similar requirements for run-of-the-river hydro must be developed as needed. \n[NPRR1029:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(1)\tERCOT shall produce forecasts of Renewable Production Potential (RPP) for Wind-powered Generation Resources (WGRs), PhotoVoltaic Generation Resources (PVGRs), and the intermittent renewable generation component of each DC-Coupled Resource to be used as an input into the Day-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (DRUC) and Hour-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (HRUC).  ERCOT shall produce the forecasts using information provided by WGRs, PVGRs, and DC-Coupled Resources; meteorological information; and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA).

ERCOT shall post on the ERCOT website objective criteria and thresholds for unbiased, accurate forecasts within five Business Days of change.\n3.14\tContracts for Reliability Resources and Emergency Response Service Resources\n(1)\tERCOT shall procure Reliability Must-Run (RMR) Service, Black Start Service (BSS) or Emergency Response Service (ERS) through Agreements.\n[NPRR885:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(1)\tERCOT shall procure Reliability Must-Run (RMR) Service, Must-Run Alternative (MRA) Service, Black Start Service (BSS), or Emergency Response Service (ERS) through Agreements.\n3.14.1\tReliability Must Run\n(1)\tRMR Service is the use by ERCOT, under contracts with Resource Entities, of capacity and energy from Generation Resources that otherwise would not operate and that are necessary to provide voltage support, stability or management of localized transmission constraints under applicable reliability criteria, where market solutions do not exist.\n(a)\tUpon receiving a Notification of Suspension of Operations (NSO) from a Resource Entity as described in Section 3.14.1.1, Notification of Suspension of Operations, ERCOT may begin procurement of RMR Service under this Section.  \n(b)\tBefore entering into an RMR Agreement, ERCOT shall assess alternatives to the proposed RMR Agreement.  ERCOT shall evaluate and present in a written report posted on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area the information in items (i) through (iv) below.  ERCOT is not limited in the number of additional scenarios it chooses to evaluate.  The written report shall include an explanation as to why the items below are insufficient, either alone or in combination, to fill the requirement that will be met by the potential RMR Unit.  The report shall be posted in the time frame required under paragraph (5) of Section 3.14.1.2, ERCOT Evaluation Process.  The list of alternatives ERCOT must consider includes (as reasonable for each type of reliability concern identified):\n(i)\tRe-dispatch/reconfiguration through operator instruction;\n(ii)\tAutomatic Mitigation Plans (AMPs) and Remedial Action Plans (RAPs);\n(iii)\tRemedial Action Schemes (RASs) initiated on unit trips or Transmission Facilities\u2019 Outages; and\n(iv)\tAny other operational alternatives deemed viable by ERCOT.\n(c)\tERCOT shall minimize the use of RMR Units as much as practicable subject to the other provisions of these Protocols.  ERCOT may Dispatch an RMR Unit at any time for ERCOT System security.    \n(d)\tEach RMR Unit must meet technical requirements specified in Section 8.1.1.1, Ancillary Service Qualification and Testing.\n(e)\tERCOT may execute RMR Agreements for no less than one month and no more than one year, with one exception.  ERCOT may execute an RMR Agreement for a term longer than 12 months if the Resource Entity must make a significant capital expenditure to meet environmental regulations or to ensure availability to continue operating the RMR Unit so as to make an RMR Agreement in excess of 12 months appropriate, in ERCOT\u2019s opinion.  The term of a multi-year RMR Agreement must take into account the appropriate RMR exit strategy discussed in Section 3.14.1.4, Exit Strategy from an RMR Agreement.  In the event ERCOT chooses to contract for an RMR Unit for longer than one year, ERCOT shall annually re-evaluate the need for the RMR Unit under the criteria set forth in paragraph (b) above.  If ERCOT determines the RMR Unit is no longer needed, ERCOT shall enter into exit negotiations with the contract signatories to attempt to exit the contract early.  However, ERCOT shall not enter into such negotiations until a Market Notice is issued providing the anticipated RMR exit time frame.  The RMR standard Agreement is included in Section 22, Attachment B, Standard Form Reliability Must-Run Agreement.  ERCOT shall post each RMR Agreement in its entirety, including amendments or modifications thereto, within five Business Days of execution on the MIS Secure Area.\n(f)\tA Generation Resource is eligible for RMR status based on criteria established by ERCOT indicating its operation is necessary to support ERCOT System reliability according to the Operating Guides.  A combined-cycle generation Facility must be treated as a single unit for RMR purposes unless the combustion turbine and the steam turbine can operate separately.  If the steam turbine and combustion turbine can operate separately, and the steam turbine is powered by waste heat from more than one combustion turbine, the combustion turbine accepted for RMR Service and a proportionate part of the steam turbine must be treated as a single unit for RMR purposes.  If the combustion turbine accepted for RMR Service can operate separately from the steam turbine, and only the combustion turbine is accepted as an RMR Unit, the RMR energy price will be reduced by the value of the combustion turbine\u2019s waste heat calculated at the Fuel Index Price (FIP), except when the steam turbine is Off-Line.\n(g)\tA Resource Entity cannot be compelled to enter into an RMR Agreement.  A Resource Entity that owns or controls a Generation Resource that is uneconomic to remain in service can voluntarily petition ERCOT for contracted RMR status by following the process in this subsection.  ERCOT shall determine whether the Generation Resource is necessary for system reliability based on the criteria set forth in this Section.\n(h)\tERCOT must contract for the entire capacity of each RMR Unit.\n(i)\tERCOT shall post on the MIS Secure Area all information relative to the use of RMR Units including energy deployed monthly.\n[NPRR1240:  Replace paragraph (i) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(i)\tERCOT shall post on the ERCOT website all information relative to the use of RMR Units including energy deployed monthly.\n(j)\tThe Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit may not use the RMR Unit for:\n(i)\tParticipating in the bilateral energy market;\n(ii)\tSelf-providing of energy except for plant auxiliary Load obligations under the RMR Agreement; and\n(iii)\tProviding of Ancillary Service to any Entity.\n(k)\tERCOT shall issue a Market Notice on the need for an RMR Unit prior to entering negotiations for the RMR Unit.  Such Market Notice shall include the link to the ERCOT final RMR evaluation, the Resource name and unit code, the name of the Resource Entity, the name of the Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) for the Resource, the Resource MW rating by Season, and potential duration of the RMR Agreement, including anticipated start and end dates.\n(l)\tERCOT shall, through the issuance of Market Notices, provide the same information, contemporaneously, about the need for, or elimination of an RMR Unit to all registered Market Participants, including QSEs and Resource Entities with RMR Units.\n3.14.1.1\tNotification of Suspension of Operations\n(1)\tExcept for the occurrence of a Forced Outage, a Resource Entity must notify ERCOT in writing no less than 150 days prior to the date on which the Resource Entity intends to cease or suspend operation of a Generation Resource for a period of greater than 180 days.  If a Generation Resource is to be mothballed on a seasonal basis, the Resource Entity must notify ERCOT in writing no less than 90 days prior to the suspension date and identify its Seasonal Operation Period.  \n(2)\tThe Resource Entity shall submit a completed Part I and Part II of the NSO (found in Section 22, Attachment E, Notification of Suspension of Operations).  The Resource Entity may also complete Part III of the NSO and submit it along with Parts I and II, or may wait to submit Part III up to ten days after ERCOT makes a determination that the proposed suspension of the Generation Resource would result in a performance deficiency for which the Generation Resource has a material impact.  Part I of the NSO must include the attestation of an officer of the Resource Entity that the Generation Resource is uneconomic to remain in service as currently designated and will be unavailable for Dispatch by ERCOT for a period specified in the NSO.  \n(3)\tA Resource Entity ceasing or suspending operations as a result of a Forced Outage lasting greater than 180 days shall notify ERCOT as soon as practicable by submitting an NSO.  If an NSO is submitted for a Generation Resource that is suspending operations for greater than 180 days due to a Forced Outage but is not indefinitely or permanently ceasing operations, then:\n(a)\tThe Generation Resource will not be evaluated for RMR status;  \n(b)\tThe NSO will not be posted on the ERCOT website, except that information contained in the NSO may be included in reports in accordance with Section 3.2.6.2.2, Total Capacity Estimate; and\n(c)\tERCOT will not issue a Market Notice.\n(4)\tAt least 60 days before the expiration of an existing RMR Agreement, the Resource Entity may apply to renew the RMR Agreement by submitting a new NSO (including both Part I and Part II).  Upon receipt of such a renewal request, ERCOT shall update and post to the MIS Secure Area studies as set forth in Section 3.14.1, Reliability Must Run, within 15 Business Days. \n3.14.1.2\tERCOT Evaluation Process\n(1)\tExcept as provided in paragraph (3) of Section 3.14.1.1, Notification of Suspension of Operations, upon receipt of an NSO under Section 3.14.1.1 ERCOT shall post the NSO on the ERCOT website and shall post on the MIS Secure Area all existing relevant studies and data and provide a Market Notice of the NSO and posting of the studies and data.\n(2)\tWithin 21 days after receiving the NSO described in paragraph (1) above, unless otherwise notified by ERCOT that a shorter comment period is required, Market Participants may submit comments to ERCOT on whether the Generation Resource(s) referenced in the NSO is necessary to support ERCOT System reliability or should qualify for a multi-year RMR Agreement.  ERCOT shall consider and post all submitted comments on the MIS Secure Area.\n(3)\tERCOT shall conduct a reliability analysis of the need for any Generation Resource(s) with a summer Seasonal net max sustainable rating greater than or equal to 20 MW to support ERCOT System reliability.  For Generation Resource(s) with a summer Seasonal net max sustainable rating less than 20 MW, ERCOT may conduct a reliability analysis if deemed appropriate by ERCOT following consultation with affected Transmission Service Provider(s) (TSP(s)).\n(a)\tERCOT shall use a Load forecast consistent with current Regional Transmission Plan assumptions and methodologies for the appropriate season(s).  If additional new Generation Resources meet the criteria in Planning Guide Section 6.9, Addition of Proposed Generation to the Planning Models, ERCOT shall include those additional Generation Resources with the appropriate seasonal ratings.  \n(b)\tIf the NSO indicates that the Generation Resource(s) will decommission or suspend operation, or in the case of a Forced Outage, has permanently ceased operation, ERCOT, in its sole discretion, may perform transmission reliability analysis over a planning horizon as defined by the available base cases but not to exceed two years.\n(c)\tFor purposes of the reliability analysis, ERCOT shall use the following criteria to identify a performance deficiency that is materially impacted by the Generation Resource:\n(i)\tWithout the Generation Resource, there are one or more Transmission Facilities loaded above their Normal Rating under pre-contingency conditions.\n(ii)\tWithout the Generation Resource, there is any instability or cascading for any of the following conditions:\n(A)\tPre-contingency;\n(B)\tNormal system conditions followed by the contingency loss of a generating unit, transmission circuit, common tower outage, transformer, shunt device, or flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) device;\n(C)\tUnavailability of a generating unit, followed by Manual System Adjustments, followed by the contingency loss of a generating unit, transmission circuit, common tower outage, transformer, shunt device, or FACTS device; or\n(D)\tUnavailability of a 345/138 kV transformer, followed by Manual System Adjustments, followed by the contingency loss of a generating unit, transmission circuit, common tower outage, transformer, shunt device, or FACTS device.\n(iii)\tWithout the Generation Resource, there are one or more Transmission Facilities loaded above 110% of the Emergency Rating under normal system conditions followed by the contingency loss of a generating unit, transmission circuit, common tower outage, transformer, shunt device, or FACTS device.\n(iv)\tFor paragraphs (i) through (iii) above, the Generation Resource will only be deemed to have a material impact on a performance deficiency that is caused by a thermal overload(s) if the Generation Resource has a more than 2% unloading Shift Factor on the Transmission Facility(s) that is overloaded and more than 5% unloading impact on the Transmission Facility(s) that is overloaded.  For purposes herein, an unloading impact is a measure of a reduction in flow on a Transmission Facility as a percent of its Rating due to a unit injection of power from the Generation Resource.\n(v)\tERCOT may, in its sole discretion, deviate from the above criteria in order to maintain ERCOT System reliability.  However, ERCOT shall present its reasons for deviating from the above criteria to the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and ERCOT Board.\n(d)\tERCOT, in consultation with affected TSP(s), may rely upon the results of past planning studies to determine if the Generation Resource is necessary to support ERCOT System reliability.  The past planning studies must have used the same or more restrictive reliability criteria than the criteria described in paragraph (c) above.\n(e)\tAdditionally, ERCOT shall conduct any other analysis (e.g., operations studies) as required and shall post all study data and results and all analyses and its determination on the MIS Secure Area and issue a Market Notice of its determination.\n(4)\tWithin 30 days after receiving the NSO, ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice indicating the status of the reliability analysis referenced in paragraph (3) above.  The Market Notice will indicate one of the following:\n(a)\tERCOT has completed its reliability analysis and the Generation Resource is not required to support ERCOT System reliability;\n(b)\tERCOT has completed its reliability analysis and the analysis identifies a performance deficiency for which the Generation Resource has a material impact; or\n(c)\tERCOT has not completed its reliability analysis and will need additional time to complete the assessment. \n(5)\tWithin 60 days after receiving Part I and Part II of the NSO, ERCOT shall complete its reliability analysis described in paragraph (3) above and shall issue a Market Notice describing the results of its reliability analysis if the results were not provided in the Market Notice issued under paragraph (4) above.  If ERCOT determines that the Generation Resource is not needed to support ERCOT System reliability, then the Generation Resource may cease or suspend operations according to the schedule in its NSO, unless ERCOT in its sole discretion permits the Generation Resource to suspend operations at an earlier date, and ERCOT shall note this in the Market Notice.\n(6)\tWithin ten days after a determination by ERCOT that the proposed suspension of the Generation Resource would result in a performance deficiency on which the Generation Resource has a material impact, as described in this Section, ERCOT shall issue a \u201cRequest for Proposal\u201d (RFP) for Must-Run Alternatives (MRAs).  ERCOT shall include in the RFP reasonably available information that would enable potential MRAs to assess the feasibility of submitting a proposal to provide a more cost effective alternative to the Generation Resource, including any known minimum technical requirements and/or operational characteristics required to eliminate the identified performance deficiency.  The MRA RFP shall specify the expected number of hours that an MRA would be needed during the contract period, and the hours of the day, by season, that the MRA would be required to be available.  ERCOT shall establish an RFP response schedule such that responses can be evaluated prior to 150 days after submittal of the NSO.\n(7)\tWithin ten days after a determination by ERCOT that the proposed suspension of the Generation Resource would result in a performance deficiency on which the Generation Resource has a material impact, as described in this Section, the Resource Entity shall, if it has not already done so, complete and submit to ERCOT Part III of the NSO (Section 22, Attachment E, Notification of Suspension of Operations).  ERCOT shall post the Part III information on the ERCOT website.  Concurrently, the Generation Resource shall submit an initial estimated budget used in the calculation of the proposed Standby Cost and RMR fuel adder, prepared in accordance with Section 3.14.1.11, Budgeting Eligible Costs, and Section 3.14.1.20, Budgeting Fuel Costs, to ERCOT.  On or before the 11th day after the determination or the receipt of Part III of the NSO, whichever comes first, ERCOT and the Resource Entity shall begin good faith negotiations on an RMR Agreement.  These negotiations shall include the budgeting process for Eligible Costs and for fuel costs as detailed in Section 3.14.1.11 and Section 3.14.1.20.\n(8)\tERCOT shall issue a Market Notice on the status of the RMR Unit or MRA, including the start date, duration of the RMR or MRA Agreement, the Standby Cost ($/Hour) as applicable, and the amount of MW under contract, within 24 hours of signing an RMR or MRA Agreement with a Resource Entity.\n(9)\tExcept in cases where the Generation Resource is to be mothballed on a seasonal basis, if, after 150 days following ERCOT\u2019s receipt of Part I and Part II of the NSO, ERCOT has neither notified the Resource Entity that the continued operation of the Generation Resource is not required nor obtained ERCOT Board approval to enter into an RMR or MRA Agreement, then the Resource Entity may file a complaint with the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) under subsection (e)(1) of P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.502, Pricing Safeguards in Markets Operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.  If the Generation Resource is to be mothballed on a seasonal basis, then the Resource Entity may file such a complaint with the PUCT under subsection (e)(1) of P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.502 if ERCOT has neither notified the Resource Entity that the continued operation of the Generation Resource is not required nor obtained ERCOT Board approval to enter into an RMR Agreement within 90 days following ERCOT\u2019s receipt of Part I and Part II of the NSO.\n(10)\tIf the ERCOT Board approves entering into an RMR Agreement but ERCOT and the Resource Entity have not both executed the RMR Agreement by the date on which the Resource Entity intends to cease or suspend operation of the Generation Resource, then the Resource Entity shall maintain that Generation Resource(s) so that it is available for Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) commitment until no longer required to do so under subsection (e)(2) of P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.502.  This paragraph does not apply to a Generation Resource that suspended operations due to a Forced Outage.\n3.14.1.2.1\tERCOT Evaluation of Seasonal Mothball Status\n(1)\tERCOT shall evaluate requests to place Generation Resources on a seasonal mothball status pursuant to the guidelines provided in Section 3.14.1.2, ERCOT Evaluation Process, except as stated below.\n(2)\tWithin 30 days after receiving the NSO described in Section 3.14.1.1, Notification of Suspension of Operations, ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice indicating the status of the reliability analysis described in paragraph (3) of Section 3.14.1.2.  The Market Notice will indicate one of the following:  \n(a)\tERCOT has completed its reliability analysis and the Generation Resource is not required to support ERCOT System reliability during the portion of the year when the Generation Resource would be unavailable;\n(b)\tERCOT has completed its reliability analysis and the analysis identifies a performance deficiency for which the Generation Resource has a material impact during the portion of the year when the Generation Resource would be unavailable; or\n(c)\tERCOT has not completed its reliability analysis and will need additional time to complete the assessment.   \n(3)\tWithin 60 days after receiving the NSO ERCOT shall complete its reliability analysis described in paragraph (3) of Section 3.14.1.2 and, if it has not already done so, ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice stating whether the Generation Resource is required to support ERCOT System reliability during the portion of the year when the Generation Resource would be unavailable.\n3.14.1.3\tERCOT Board Approval of RMR and MRA Agreements\n(1)\tIf ERCOT determines that an RMR or MRA Agreement is a cost-effective solution to remedy a performance deficiency for which the suspending Generation Resource has a material impact as described in paragraph (3) of Section 3.14.1.2, ERCOT Evaluation Process, or if ERCOT has identified such a performance deficiency but has determined that entering into an RMR or MRA Agreement is not a cost-effective solution to that performance deficiency, then ERCOT shall present this finding to the ERCOT Board for approval.  In seeking such approval, ERCOT shall stipulate to the ERCOT Board that:\n(a)\tThe Resource Entity provided a complete and timely NSO including a sworn attestation supporting its claim of pending Generation Resource closure;\n(b)\tERCOT received all of the data necessary to evaluate the need for and provisions of the RMR or MRA Agreement, and that information was posted on the MIS Secure Area by ERCOT as it became available to ERCOT;\n(c)\tWhen executed, the signed RMR or MRA Agreement will comply with the ERCOT Protocols and be posted on the MIS Secure Area;\n(d)\tERCOT evaluated:\n(i)\tThe reasonable alternatives to a specific RMR Agreement as set forth in Section 3.14.1, Reliability Must Run, and compared the alternatives against the feasibility, cost and reliability impacts of the signed RMR Agreement;\n(ii)\tThe timeframe in which ERCOT expects each unit to be needed for reliability; and\n(iii)\tThe specific type and scope of reliability concerns identified for each RMR Unit or MRA as applicable.\n(2)\tERCOT shall execute the RMR or MRA Agreement as soon as feasible after receiving ERCOT Board approval to do so.\n(3)\tERCOT shall post on the MIS Secure Area, as they become available, unit-specific studies, reports, and data, by which ERCOT justified entering into the RMR or MRA Agreement.\n3.14.1.4\tExit Strategy from an RMR Agreement\n(1)\tNo later than 90 days after the execution of an RMR Agreement, ERCOT shall report to the Board and post on the MIS Secure Area a list of feasible alternatives that may, at a future time, be more cost-effective than the continued renewal of the existing RMR Agreement.  Through the ERCOT System planning process, ERCOT shall develop a list of potential alternatives to the service provided by the RMR Unit.  At a minimum, the list of potential alternatives that ERCOT must consider include, building new or expanding existing Transmission Facilities, installing voltage control devices, soliciting or buying by auction interruptible Load from Retail Electric Providers (REPs), or extending the existing RMR Agreement on an annual basis.  If a cost-effective alternative to the service provided by the RMR Unit is identified, ERCOT shall provide a proposed timeline to study and/or implement the alternative.\n3.14.1.5\tEvaluation of Alternatives\n(1)\tIn evaluating responses to the RFP for MRAs, ERCOT shall not consider any response that, in ERCOT\u2019s sole opinion, does not facially demonstrate that the proposed MRA meets the eligibility requirements specified in Section 3.14.4.1, Overview and Description of MRAs, and the availability criteria and other conditions specified in the RFP for MRAs.\n(2)\tERCOT shall consider any of the following options to resolve an identified performance deficiency:\n(a)\tThe Generation Resource proposed for suspension of operations;\n(b)\tAll acceptable MRA proposals; and\n(c)\tAny transmission upgrades that can be implemented prior to the time period for which the performance deficiency has been identified.\n(3)\tERCOT staff shall select the option or combination of options, if any, that most cost-effectively address the performance deficiency, as long as the cost of the selected options is justified given the possible impact to Customers due to the performance deficiency.  If ERCOT determines that no option cost-effectively resolves the performance deficiency, then ERCOT shall not select any option.  In selecting the most cost-effective option, ERCOT will consider the following factors:\n(a)\tThe degree to which the option addresses the identified performance deficiency;\n(b)\tThe total expected cost of each option; \n(c)\tExpected unit performance of the Generation Resource proposed for suspension of operations, including start-up time, minimum run-time, minimum down-time, and historical unit outage data;\n(d)\tOperational limitations of proposed MRAs, including start-up times, minimum run-times, ramp periods, and return-to-service times;\n(e)\tOther operational constraints or operational benefits of the proposed option; and\n(f)\tAny other factors which ERCOT determines are relevant to the evaluation, and for which ERCOT can develop quantifiable criteria with which to evaluate all proposed options. \n(4)\tIn evaluating the expected impact to Customers due to the performance deficiency, ERCOT shall consider the following factors:\n(a)\tExpected amount of Customer Demand affected (MWh);\n(b)\tExpected number of hours during which Customers will be affected;\n(c)\tNumber of Customers affected;\n(d)\tPossible additional Customer impacts due to unforeseen conditions, such as Generation Resource unavailability, transmission circuit Outages, or Load variation due to extreme weather; and\n(e)\tPotential economic impact to Customers.\n(5)\tERCOT staff shall recommend the selected option or options to the ERCOT Board of Directors for approval, or shall recommend that the ERCOT Board of Directors decline to accept any option, if no eligible, cost-effective option has been identified.  ERCOT staff shall provide sufficient information to justify its recommendation.  The ERCOT Board of Directors may approve or reject the proposed recommendation, or may direct ERCOT staff to pursue an agreement to procure one or more options not proposed by ERCOT staff.\n3.14.1.6\tTransmission System Upgrades Associated with an RMR and/or MRA Exit Strategy\n(1)\tThis Section applies only to RMR exit strategies corresponding to specific RMR or MRA Agreements that have not been terminated.\n(a)\tERCOT and the TSP(s) responsible for constructing any upgrades to the Transmission Facilities that are part of an RMR or MRA exit strategy shall coordinate construction clearances necessary to allow timely completion of all planned Transmission Facilities upgrades.\n(b)\tThe TSP(s) responsible for constructing upgrades to the Transmission Facilities that are part of an RMR or MRA exit strategy shall establish and send to ERCOT estimated Outage information, including completion dates and associated model information to ERCOT per Section 3.1.4, Communications Regarding Resource and Transmission Facilities Outages.  For purposes of this Section, a Transmission Facility upgrade will be considered initiated upon the TSP authorizing any expenditures on the upgrade including, but not limited to, material procurement, right-of-way acquisition, and regulatory approvals. \n(c)\tUpon initiation of the project, the TSP(s) responsible for constructing upgrades relating to the Transmission Facilities that are part of an RMR or MRA exit strategy shall provide to ERCOT monthly updates of the project\u2019s status, noting any acceleration or delay in planned completion date. ERCOT shall report this data through the MIS as described in Section 12.2, ERCOT Responsibilities. Within 60 days of the completion date shown in the Notice provided per Section 3.1.4, for the Transmission Facilities upgrades, the TSP shall coordinate more timely updates if the timeline changes significantly.  \n(d)\tWithin ten Business Days after completion of the Transmission Facilities upgrades that are part of an RMR or MRA exit strategy, ERCOT shall publish a Market Notice of such completion and the effective date of termination of the associated RMR or MRA Agreement.\n3.14.1.7\tRMR or MRA Contract Termination\n(1)\tThis Section applies only to RMR exit strategies corresponding to specific RMR or MRA Agreements that have not been terminated.\n(2)\tOnce a suitable RMR or MRA exit strategy has been developed as defined in Section 3.14.1.4, Exit Strategy from an RMR Agreement, and the strategy has been approved by the ERCOT Board and the affected TSP(s), the TSP(s) responsible for the Transmission Facilities upgrades, when requested by ERCOT, shall submit to ERCOT:\n(a)\tA preliminary construction outage schedule necessary to complete the Transmission Facilities upgrades.  Submissions, changes, approvals, rejections, and withdrawals regarding the preliminary construction outage schedule shall be processed through the ERCOT Outage Scheduler on the ERCOT MIS.  Such construction outage schedule shall be updated monthly; or\n(b)\tA Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN) application timeline for projects requiring such PUCT certification.  Once a CCN has been granted by the PUCT, the TSP(s) shall be required to meet the requirements in item (a) above.\n(3)\tERCOT shall review and approve or reject each construction outage schedule as provided in accordance with procedures developed by ERCOT in compliance with Section 3.1, Outage Coordination. \n(4)\tThe TSP(s) responsible for the Transmission Facilities upgrades that are part of an RMR or MRA exit strategy shall provide to ERCOT a project status and an estimated project completion date within five Business Days of ERCOT\u2019s request. \n(5)\tIf ERCOT determines that a mutually agreeable preliminary construction outage schedule can be accommodated during the fall, winter, or spring, ERCOT and the TSP shall collaborate to determine if the 90 day termination notice for the RMR and/or MRA can be issued as soon after the summer load Season of the preceding year as possible and publish a Market Notice of these terminations.  ERCOT and the TSP may give consideration to the risk of the decision to terminate the RMR and/or MRA Agreement and any options, such as RAPs and/or Mitigation Plans that could be used to mitigate transmission construction delays.\n3.14.1.8\tRMR and/or MRA Contract Extension\n(1)\tThis Section applies only to RMR exit strategies corresponding to specific RMR or MRA Agreements that have not been terminated.\n(a)\tForty-five days prior to the termination date of an existing RMR or MRA Agreement, pursuant to the 90-day termination notice as described in paragraph A(2) of Section 3, Term and Termination, of Section 22, Attachment B, Standard Form Reliability Must-Run Agreement, ERCOT shall assess the likelihood of completion of the Transmission Facilities upgrade project(s) or other exit strategies necessary to allow termination of an existing RMR or MRA Agreement based on the updates of project status provided by the TSP(s).  If ERCOT determines that a delay in the termination date of the existing RMR or MRA Agreement is necessary to allow completion of the Transmission Facilities upgrade(s), it shall provide written Notice to the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA of its intent to execute an extension to the existing RMR or MRA Agreement no later than 30 days prior to the planned termination date.  Within 24 hours of ERCOT providing this Notice to the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA, ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice on its intent to execute an extension to the existing RMR or MRA Agreement.  The Market Notice must contain the name and seasonal MW ratings of the RMR Unit or MRA and the expected duration of the contract extension, including the expected termination date.  ERCOT shall notify the ERCOT Board of the extension at the ERCOT Board\u2019s next regularly scheduled meeting.\n(b)\tForty-five days prior to the expiration date of an existing RMR or MRA Agreement for which the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA has applied for renewal, ERCOT shall assess the likelihood of completion of the Transmission Facilities upgrade project(s) necessary to eliminate the reliability need for a Resource with an existing RMR or MRA Agreement based on the updates of project status provided by the TSP(s).  If ERCOT determines that an extension of the existing RMR or MRA Agreement of no more than 90 days would allow completion of the Transmission Facilities upgrade(s), it shall provide written Notice to the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA of its intent to execute an extension to the existing RMR or MRA Agreement no later than 30 days prior to the planned expiration date.  Within 24 hours of ERCOT providing this Notice to the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA, ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice on its intent to execute an extension to the existing RMR or MRA Agreement.  The Market Notice must contain the name and seasonal MW ratings of the RMR Unit or MRA and the expected duration of the contract extension, including the expected termination date.  ERCOT shall notify the ERCOT Board of the extension at the ERCOT Board\u2019s next regularly scheduled meeting.\n(c)\tERCOT may extend the existing RMR or MRA Agreement as necessary to allow completion of the Transmission Facilities upgrade(s), but in no event shall the extension last more than 90 days from the termination or expiration date of the existing RMR or MRA Agreement. \n(d)\tForty-five days prior to the end of the period for which the existing RMR or MRA Agreement has been extended, ERCOT shall assess whether the transmission upgrades are likely to be completed.  If ERCOT determines that the upgrades are not likely to be completed, ERCOT shall enter into negotiations with the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA to negotiate a new RMR or MRA Agreement to allow completion of the planned transmission upgrades.  ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice on or before the date that extension negotiations begin with the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA.

The RMR Unit owner must present ERCOT with a budget for each option, benefits of each alternative, unit availability impact associated with not performing each alternative, and a recommendation to facilitate ERCOT\u2019s selection process.  If no reasonable alternatives are available then the RMR Unit owner shall provide an affirmation to that effect; \n(iii)\tNon-Outage Maintenance Cost, by month, which includes non-recurring Eligible Costs that are independent of a particular scheduled Outage.  Non-Outage maintenance alternatives available during any scheduled Outage must be presented to ERCOT for determination of the alternative to be performed and paid for under the RMR Agreement.  The RMR Unit owner must present ERCOT with a budget for each option, benefits of each alternative, unit availability impact associated with not performing each alternative, and a recommendation to facilitate ERCOT\u2019s selection process.  If no reasonable alternatives are available then an affirmation by the RMR Unit owner to that effect must be included in the RMR Agreement; \n(iv)\tFor Resources without approved verifiable costs, the following data is required:\n(A)\tVariable Operations & Maintenance (O&M) costs ($/start), from start to Low Sustained Limit (LSL), for each start type:\n(1)\tCold; \n(2)\tHot; and\n(3)\tIntermediate;\n(B)\tOperating variable O&M costs ($/MWh):\n(1)\tAt LSL; and\n(2)\tAbove LSL;\n(C)\tAverage generation from breaker close to LSL (MWh), for each start type:\n(1)\tCold; \n(2)\tHot; and\n(3)\tIntermediate;\n(D)\tFuel consumption (MMBtu/start), for each start type:\n(1)\tCold; \n(2)\tHot; and\n(3)\tIntermediate;\n(E)\tStartup Fuel Percentage from start to LSL, for each start type:\nFuel Type\tHot (%)\tIntermediate (%)\tCold (%)\nGas\t\t\t\nFuel Oil\t\t\t\nSolid Fuel\t\t\t\n(F) \tOperating Fuel Percentage:\nFuel Type\tAt LSL\tAbove LSL\nGas\t\t\nFuel Oil\t\t\nSolid Fuel\t\t\n(G)\tInput/output curve coefficients; \n(v)\tOther budget items means Eligible Costs not clearly identifiable in the previous three categories including:\n(A)\tEnvironmental emission credit consumption (or purchase as explicitly defined under the RMR Agreement, to operate the unit) includes the opportunity cost for using emission credits through the combustion of fuel feedstock by the RMR Unit.

The RMR Unit owner shall submit to ERCOT updated budget information every three months, in a format consistent with the preliminary budget, for the remainder of the term of the RMR Agreement.  ERCOT shall review updated budget information for reasonableness and may reject any item it determines to be unreasonable.  The owner of the RMR Unit and ERCOT may mutually agree to modify the contract capacity and Target Availability of the RMR Unit to account for any such budget item rejection.  \n(2)\tERCOT will use approved updated budget information to update the total RMR costs expected to be incurred over the remaining term of the RMR Agreement.  If the total costs over the remaining term of the RMR Agreement change by more than 10% with respect to those costs anticipated for the same period in the most recently approved budget, the RMR Standby Cost will be recalculated.  The revised Standby Cost will be recalculated by dividing the remaining budgeted costs over the number of remaining hours for which the RMR Unit is under an RMR Agreement.\n(3)\tERCOT shall issue a Market Notice describing the revised Standby Cost at least ten calendar days prior to the effective date of a change to the Standby Cost.  The effective date of a revised Standby Cost will always be on the first day of a calendar month.\n3.14.1.14\tReporting Actual RMR Eligible Costs \n(1) \tThe RMR Unit owner shall provide ERCOT with documentation supporting actual Eligible Costs on a monthly basis in a form and a level of detail acceptable to ERCOT for ERCOT to verify that all Eligible Costs are actual and appropriate.  Submitted actual Eligible Costs must be categorized consistently with budgeted Eligible Costs.  Actual cost data must be submitted on time by the Resource Entity for the RMR Unit and then verified by ERCOT so the actual cost data can be reflected in the Final or True-Up Settlement Statement. \n(2) \tTo be considered timely for the final, actual cost data for month \u2018x\u2019 must be submitted by the 16th of the month following month \u2018x\u2019.

Any deviation in filing actual cost data in accordance with this calendar must be requested of ERCOT, by the QSE representing an RMR Unit.  Such request for deviation shall contain the reason for the inability to meet the calendar and an expected date that the cost data will be provided to ERCOT.  At its discretion ERCOT may choose to honor such a request.  No later than two Business Days following its decision, ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice of any such request and its response thereto.  In the event, that actual cost data is not submitted  in accordance with the calendar or approved deviation for the true-up, then the cost for the portion of eligible cost that has not been submitted is deemed to be zero. \n3.14.1.15\tReporting Actual MRA Eligible Costs \n(1)\tThe QSE that represents the MRA that has received contributed capital expenditures shall provide ERCOT with evidence of the actual costs associated with the capital expenditures on a monthly basis in a level of detail sufficient for ERCOT to verify that all capital contributions costs are actual and appropriate.\n3.14.1.16\tReconciliation of Actual Eligible Costs\n(1)\tERCOT shall issue a miscellaneous Invoice to charge the QSE representing the RMR Unit for any identified over-payments for actual Eligible Costs.

The Incentive Factor for RMR Agreements is not applied to capital expenditures as described in Section 3.14.1, Reliability Must Run, or to capital expenditures reclassified as an expense in accordance with paragraph (3)(d) of Section 3.14.1.19, Charge for Contributed Capital Expenditures.  The Incentive Factor shall never be less than zero.\n(2)\tThe Incentive Factor shall be reduced if the RMR Unit fails to perform to the contracted capacity during a Capacity Test as described in the RMR Agreement.  The reduction will be linear, with a 2% reduction in the Incentive Factor for every 1% of reduced Capacity.\n(3)\tThe Incentive Factor shall be reduced if the \u201cHourly Rolling Equivalent Availability Factor\u201d of the RMR Unit is less than the Target Availability (i.e. the \u201cActual Availability\u201d, as defined below, is less than the Target Availability).  \n(a)\tThe reduction will be linear; with a 2% reduction in the Incentive Factor payment for every 1% of the Hourly Rolling Equivalent Availability Factor less than the Target Availability stated in the RMR Agreement.  The RMR Unit\u2019s Actual Availability shall be calculated on an hourly rolling six-month average basis. \n(b)\tThe calculation is made by dividing the total MW of available capacity per hour according to its final COP by the total MW of contracted capacity per hour for the previous 4380 hours.\n(c)\tFor purposes of this calculation, any hour within the previous 4380-hour period that precedes the start date of the RMR Agreement is treated as if 100% of the capacity of the unit was available for the hour.\n3.14.1.18\tMajor Equipment Modifications\n(1)\tDuring the term of an RMR Agreement, in the event that major equipment modifications are required in order for the RMR Unit to provide RMR Service (such as installation of environmental control equipment), ERCOT and the RMR Unit owner shall negotiate in good faith concerning changes to the terms of the RMR Agreement.\n3.14.1.19\tCharge for Contributed Capital Expenditures\n(1)\tThis Section applies to any RMR or MRA Agreement entered into by ERCOT and a Resource Entity or QSE on or after October 12, 2016.  \n(2) \tFor purposes of this Section, contributed capital expenditures are defined as expenditures that were made to ensure the availability of an RMR Unit or MRA in connection with an RMR or MRA Agreement, that were settled in accordance with the Settlement processes in the ERCOT Protocols, and that would ordinarily be capitalized under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Accounting Standards (IAS) assuming ongoing operation of the RMR Unit or MRA.  Consistent with the process described in Section 3.14.1.11, Budgeting Eligible Costs, ERCOT will identify contributed capital expenditure items included in each category of submitted Eligible Costs as defined in Section 3.14.1.10, Eligible Costs, or submitted with any MRA budgets.  \n(3)\tA QSE that has received payments from ERCOT for contributed capital expenditures pursuant to an RMR or MRA Agreement entered into on or after October 12, 2016 must refund to ERCOT the contributed capital expenditures as follows:\n(a)\tAt the end of the RMR Agreement, if the Resource Entity chooses not to have the Generation Resource participate in energy or Ancillary Service markets, the QSE representing the Resource Entity shall repay, in a lump sum payment, the positive salvage value associated with the contributed capital expenditures, as estimated at the time of the RMR Agreement.\n(b) \tAt the end of the MRA Agreement, if the QSE that represents the MRA chooses not to have the MRA participate in energy or Ancillary Service markets, the QSE representing the MRA shall repay, in a lump sum payment, the positive salvage value associated with the contributed capital expenditures, as estimated at the time of the MRA Agreement.  In addition, the QSE that represents the MRA must repay, in a lump sum payment, the value of contributed capital expenditures in excess of the actual cost of the capitalized equipment.\n(c)\tIf an RMR Unit or MRA participates in the energy or Ancillary Service markets at any time after the termination date of the RMR or MRA Agreement, the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA shall repay, in a lump sum payment, 100% of the remaining book value of the capitalized equipment and capitalized installation charges based on straight-line depreciation over the estimated life of the capitalized component(s) as of the termination date of the RMR or MRA Agreement in accordance with GAAP or IAS standards for electric utility equipment, plus 10% of the value of any accelerated tax depreciation associated with the capital contribution taken by the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA during the term of the RMR or MRA Agreement, less any remaining positive salvage value associated with the contributed capital expenditures that was previously repaid in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) above.  The estimated life shall be based on documentation provided by the manufacturer; or, if installing used equipment, the estimated life may be based on an approximation agreed to by the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA and ERCOT, but in no event shall the estimated life be less than the equipment life used for federal income tax purposes.  The value of the accelerated tax depreciation for each year shall be the difference between the straight line figure and the appropriate Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) depreciation schedule for the equipment, multiplied by the statutory tax rate.  The calculation of the accelerated depreciation as described herein must be supported by an attestation executed by an officer or executive with the authority to bind the Resource Entity or the QSE representing the Resource Entity.    \n(d)\tIf additional contributed capital expenditures are identified subsequent to execution and during the term of the RMR or MRA Agreement, the applicable repayment amounts as determined in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) above will be modified accordingly.\n(e)\tThe amount of contributed capital expenditures may be adjusted by ERCOT when early termination in accordance with the RMR Agreement results in a reclassification of capital expenditures to expenses in accordance with GAAP or IAS.\n(f)\tIf the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA is required to pay a lump sum payment of contributed capital expenditures per paragraph (a), (b), or (c) above, then ERCOT will issue a Market Notice identifying the amount of the lump sum payment within five Business Days of termination of the RMR or MRA Agreement.  \n(i)\tERCOT shall issue a miscellaneous Invoice charging the QSE for the applicable amounts under paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) above.  ERCOT will issue a Market Notice after completion of the collection and disbursement of the repaid contributed capital expenditures.\n(ii)\tERCOT shall distribute the repayment to QSEs representing Load per Section 6.6.6.6, Method for Reconciling RMR Actual Eligible Costs, RMR and MRA Contributed Capital Expenditures, and Miscellaneous RMR Incurred Expenses.\n3.14.1.20\tBudgeting Fuel Costs\n(1)\tThe RMR Unit owner shall supply ERCOT a preliminary monthly fuel cost budget for the anticipated term and effective date of the RMR Agreement.  The fuel cost budget must include information pertaining to the cost of the fuel feedstock, including where appropriate transportation costs and terms, as well as fuel storage costs and terms, and any other fuel contract provisions (e.g. \u201ctake or pay\u201d provisions) that may impact the cost of all fuels anticipated to be used by the RMR Unit over the life of the RMR Agreement and must include fuel costs categorized in terms of: \n(a)\tPrimary fuel; and \n(b)\tSecondary fuel.\n(2)\tThe estimated fuel payments may include a fuel adder to better approximate expected fuel costs, which may be adjusted from time to time by mutual agreement of the RMR Unit owner and ERCOT.  The fuel adder shall represent the difference between the forecasted average fuel price and the forecasted average of the relevant index price over the RMR contract period.  The fuel adder must also include the forecasted cost of transporting and delivering fuel and fuel imbalance fees to the Resource.  The RMR Unit owner must provide to ERCOT supporting documentation indicating how the fuel adder was determined.\n(3)\tThe RMR Unit owner shall provide good faith estimates of the RMR Unit input/output curve coefficients to ERCOT with its Notification of Suspension of Operations.  \n(4)\tBased on production figures provided to the RMR Unit owner by ERCOT, the RMR Unit owner shall also provide ERCOT fuel supply options available for the RMR Unit.  For each option, the RMR Unit owner shall detail the associated impacts on the fuel and non-fuel budgets and on the availability of the RMR Unit.  If no reasonable alternatives are available then an affirmation by the RMR Unit owner to that effect must be included in the RMR Agreement.  If there are available fuel options, then no less than 30 days after the receipt of the fuel supply options, ERCOT shall notify the RMR Unit owner of its fuel supply option selection.\n3.14.1.21\tReporting Actual Eligible Fuel Costs\n(1)\tThe RMR Unit owner shall provide ERCOT with actual fuel costs on a monthly basis for the RMR Unit in a level of detail sufficient for ERCOT to verify that all fuel costs are actual and appropriate.  ERCOT shall perform a true-up of the estimated fuel costs using the submitted and verified actual fuel costs for the RMR Unit.  Actual cost data must be submitted on time by the Resource Entity for the RMR Unit and then verified by ERCOT so the actual cost data can be reflected in the True-Up Settlement Statement.  To be considered timely for the final, actual cost data for month \u2018x\u2019 must be submitted by the 16th of the month following month \u2018x.\u2019  To be considered timely for the true-up, actual cost data for month \u2018x\u2019 must be submitted 60 days prior to the publishing date of the True-Up Settlement Statement for the first day in month \u2018x.\u2019  Any deviation in filing actual cost data in accordance with this calendar must be requested of ERCOT, by the QSE representing an RMR Unit.  Such request for deviation shall contain the reason for the inability to meet the calendar and an expected date that the cost data will be provided to ERCOT.  At its discretion ERCOT may choose to honor such a request.  No later than two Business Days following its decision, ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice of any such request and its response thereto.  In the event that actual cost data is not submitted in accordance with the timeline or is not an approved deviation for the true-up, then the cost for the portion of Eligible Cost that has not been submitted is deemed to be zero.\n(2)\tActual fuel costs must be appropriate actual costs attributable to ERCOT\u2019s scheduling and/or deployment of the RMR Unit.  Actual fuel costs may include cost of fuel (including the cost of exceeding swing gas contract limits, additional gas demand costs set by fuel supply, or transportation contracts); demand fees, imbalance penalties, transportation charges, and cash out premiums. In addition, actual fuel costs may include costs incurred to:\n(a)\tKeep the boiler(s) warmed, if approved in advance by ERCOT; and \n(b)\tTest the RMR Unit prior to or during the term of the RMR Agreement, if approved in advance by ERCOT.\n3.14.2\tBlack Start\n(1)\tEach Generation Resource providing BSS must meet the requirements specified in North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards and the Operating Guides.\n(2)\tEach Generation Resource providing BSS must meet the technical requirements specified in Section 8.1.1, QSE Ancillary Service Performance Standards, and Section 8.1.1.1, Ancillary Service Qualification and Testing.\n(3)\tBids for BSS are due on or before February 15th of each three-year period.  Bids must be evaluated based on evaluation criteria attached as an appendix to the request for bids and contracted by December 31st for the following three-year period.  ERCOT shall ensure BSSs are arranged, provided, and deployed as necessary to reenergize the ERCOT System following a Blackout or Partial Blackout.\n(a)\tResources shall disclose any weather-related limitations that could affect the Resource\u2019s ability to provide BSS using the form provided in Section 22, Attachment M, Generation Resource Disclosure Regarding Bids for Black Start Service, as part of a bid to provide BSS. \n(b)\tBSS bids shall include the hourly stand-by price and the BSS Back-up Fuel costs where applicable.\n(c)\tWhen a Resource is selected to provide BSS, the Black Start Resource shall be required to complete all applicable testing requirements as specified in Section 8.1.1.2.1.5, System Black Start Capability Qualification and Testing.\n(d)\tERCOT shall provide a list of all prospective Black Start Resources that responded to the RFP for BSS to the impacted TSPs no later than seven days after the date on which bids for BSS are due.  Any feedback from affected TSPs shall be limited to the identification of transmission constraints that may adversely impact the ability of the Black Start Resource to energize the \u201cNext Start Resource\u201d and shall be due to ERCOT by March 1st of that year.  ERCOT shall share the feedback with the QSE representing the prospective Black Start Resource as soon as practicable.  The QSE representing the Black Start Resource shall have the option to provide a response to any feedback provided by an affected TSP.\n(4)\tERCOT may schedule unannounced Black Start testing, to verify that BSS is operable as specified in Section 8.1.1.2.1.5.\n(5)\tQSEs representing Generation Resources contracting for BSSs shall participate in training and restoration drills coordinated by ERCOT.\n(6)\tERCOT shall periodically determine and review the location and number of Black Start Resources required, as well as any special transmission or voice communication needs required.  ERCOT and providers of this service shall meet the requirements as specified in the Operating Guides and in NERC Reliability Standards.\n(7)\tA Resource Entity representing a Black Start Resource may request that an alternate Generation Resource which is connected to the same black start primary and secondary cranking path as the original Black Start Resource be substituted in place of the original Black Start Resource during the three-year term of an executed Standard Form Black Start Agreement (Section 22, Attachment D, Standard Form Black Start Agreement) if the alternate Generation Resource meets testing and verification under established qualification criteria to ensure BSS.\n(a)\tERCOT, in its sole discretion, may reject a Resource Entity\u2019s request for an alternate Generation Resource and will provide the Resource Entity an explanation of such rejection.  \n(b)\tIf ERCOT accepts the alternative Generation Resource as the substituted Black Start Resource, such acceptance shall not affect the original terms, conditions and obligations of the Resource Entity under the Standard Form Black Start Agreement.  The Resource Entity shall submit to ERCOT an Amendment to Standard Form Black Start Agreement (Section 22, Attachment I, Amendment to Standard Form Black Start Agreement) after qualification criteria has been met.\n(8)\tFor the purpose of the Black Start Hourly Standby Fee as described in Section 6.6.8.1, Black Start Hourly Standby Fee Payment, the BSS Availability Reduction Factor shall be determined by using the availability for the original Black Start Resource and any substituted Black Start Resource(s), as appropriate for the rolling 4380-hour period of the evaluation.\n(9)\tEach Generation Resource selected to provide BSS shall be prepared and able to provide BSS at any time as may be required by ERCOT, subject only to the limitations described in ERCOT Protocols or the Black Start Agreement.  \n(10)\tEach Generation Resource selected to provide BSS shall be able to utilize BSS Back-up Fuel for BSS and shall maintain a contracted amount of BSS Back-up Fuel to run the Black Start Resource for a minimum of 72 hours at its maximum output.  The Generation Resource shall maintain the contracted amount of BSS Back-up Fuel at all times during the duration of the BSS contract term unless performing a BSS Back-up Fuel Switching Test or the Generation Resource is operating pursuant to a Black Start deployment event.  This requirement does not apply to Resources that do not rely on purchased fuel.  \n(11)\tA Black Start Resource may utilize the contracted amount of BSS Back-up Fuel outside of BSS if ERCOT determines it is necessary during an Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) event.\n(12)\tA Black Start Resource is not obligated to contract its full on site fuel storage capability for BSS Back-up Fuel.  On site backup fuel in excess of the contracted BSS Back-up Fuel amount may be used by the Generation Resource at the discretion of the Generation Resource and ERCOT shall not prevent the Black Start Resource from utilizing the excess fuel, nor shall the Black Start Resource be required to request permission from ERCOT to utilize fuel in excess of the contracted BSS Back-up Fuel amount.  \n(13)\tERCOT may, at its discretion, waive the BSS Back-up Fuel requirement stated in this Section, in whole or in part, if ERCOT deems necessary in order to procure a sufficient number or preferred combination of Generation Resources to provide BSS.\n(14)\tA Resource Entity that submits a bid or is contracted to provide BSS or serve as an alternate to provide BSS with a Switchable Generation Resource (SWGR): \n(a)\tShall not nominate the SWGR to satisfy supply adequacy or capacity planning requirements in any Control Area other than the ERCOT Region during the term of the BSS contract; \n(b)\tShall submit a report to ERCOT in compliance with paragraph (2) of Section 16.5.4, Maintaining and Updating Resource Entity Information, indicating that the SWGR does not have any contractual requirement in a non-ERCOT Control Area during the term of the BSS contract; and \n(c)\tShall take any further action requested by ERCOT to ensure that ERCOT will be classified as the \u201cPrimary Party\u201d for the SWGR under any agreement between ERCOT and another Control Area Operator (CAO) during the term of the BSS contract.    \n(15)\tIf a Resource Entity with a SWGR is contracted to provide BSS or designated as an alternate to provide BSS, the Resource Entity shall have its Black Start plan procedures approved by ERCOT.  In the event of a Partial Blackout or Blackout of the ERCOT System, the Resource Entity with a SWGR shall immediately: \n(a)\tEffectuate its Black Start plan procedures to be available to provide BSS; and  \n(b)\tProvide BSS as directed by ERCOT or the local Transmission Operator (TO).\n(16)\tEach Resource Entity shall identify in its Resources Registration data if its Resource is a Black Start Capable Resource and an Isochronous Control Capable Resource.\n(17)\tEach Resource Entity and each TSP shall identify in the Network Operations Model if a modeled breaker or switch it operates or directs the operation of has a Synchroscope and a Synchronism Check Relay associated with the breaker or switch.\n3.14.3\tEmergency Response Service\n(1)\tERCOT shall procure and deploy ERS with the goal of promoting reliability prior to and during energy emergencies.\n3.14.3.1\tEmergency Response Service Procurement\n(1)\tERCOT shall issue Requests for Proposals to procure ERS for each Standard Contract Term.  The ERS Standard Contract Terms are as follows:\n(a)\tDecember through March;\n(b)\tApril and May;\n(c)\tJune through September; and\n(d)\tOctober and November.\n(2)\tERCOT shall procure ERS from one or more of the four following ERS service types:\n(a)\tWeather-Sensitive ERS-10\n(b)\tNon-Weather-Sensitive ERS-10\n(c)\tWeather-Sensitive ERS-30\n(d)\tNon-Weather-Sensitive ERS-30\n(3)\tERS offers shall be submitted only by QSEs capable of receiving Extensible Markup Language (XML) messaging on behalf of represented ERS Resources.   \n(4)\tEach site in an ERS Generator must have an interconnection agreement with its TDSP prior to submitting an ERS offer and must have exported energy to the ERCOT System prior to the offer due date.  An ERS Resource that cannot inject energy to the ERCOT System can only be offered as an ERS Load.\n(5)\tIn order to qualify as weather-sensitive, an ERS Load must meet one of the following criteria:\n(a)\tThe ERS Load must consist exclusively of residential sites; or \n(b)\tThe ERS Load must consist exclusively of non-residential sites and must qualify as weather-sensitive based on the accuracy of the regression baseline evaluation methodology as described in Section 8.1.3.1.1, Baselines for Emergency Response Service Loads, as an indicator of actual interval Load.\n(i)\tERCOT shall establish minimum accuracy standards for qualification as an ERS Load under the regression baseline evaluation methodology.  \n(ii)\tAn ERS Load must have at least nine months of interval meter data to qualify as weather-sensitive under the regression baseline evaluation methodology.\n(iii)\tERCOT\u2019s determination that an ERS Load qualifies as a weather-sensitive ERS Load is independent of ERCOT\u2019s determination of which baseline methodologies may be appropriate for purposes of evaluating the ERS Load\u2019s performance.\n(c)\tIf a site with Distributed Renewable Generation (DRG) has been designated by the QSE to be evaluated by using its native load, the default baseline analysis shall be performed using the calculated native load.\n(6)\tQSEs representing ERS Resources may submit offers for one or more ERS Time Periods within an ERS Standard Contract Term.  ERS Time Periods shall be defined by ERCOT in the RFP for that ERS Standard Contract Term.  An ERS offer is specific to an ERS Time Period.  In submitting an offer, both the QSE and the ERS Resource are committing to provide ERS for that ERS Time Period if selected.\n(7)\tA QSE may submit separate offers for an ERS Resource to provide any or all of the four ERS service types during the same or different ERS Time Periods in the same ERS Standard Contract Term, but ERCOT shall only award offers for one service type for each ERS Resource.\n(8)\tThe minimum capacity offer for an ERS Load on the weather-sensitive baseline is one half (0.5) MW; all other ERS capacity offers will have a minimum amount that may be offered of one-tenth (0.1) MW.  ERS Resources may be aggregated to reach this requirement.\n(9)\tOffers from ERS Generators must include self-serve capacity and injection capacity amounts greater than or equal to zero for each ERS Time Period offered.\n(10)\tERCOT may establish an upper limit, in MWs, on the amount of ERS capacity it will procure for any ERS Time Period in any ERS Standard Contract Term.\t\n(11)\tA QSE\u2019s offer to provide ERS shall include: \n(a)\tThe name of the QSE representing the ERS Resource and the name of an individual authorized by the QSE to represent the QSE and its ERS Resource(s);\n(b)\tThe name of an Entity that controls the ERS Resource, and an affirmation that the QSE has obtained written authorization from the Entity to submit ERS offers on its behalf and to represent the Entity in all matters before ERCOT concerning the Entity\u2019s provision of ERS;\n(c)\tAny information or data specified by ERCOT, including access to historical meter data, and affirmation by the QSE that it has obtained written authorization from the controlling Entity of the ERS Resource for the QSE to obtain such data;\n(d)\tAffirmation that the controlling Entity of the ERS Resource has reviewed P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.507, Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) Emergency Response Service (ERS), these Protocols and Other Binding Documents relating to the provision of ERS, and has agreed to comply with and be bound by such provisions;\n(e)\tAn agreement by the QSE to produce any written authorization or agreement between the QSE and any ERS Resource it represents, as described in this Section, upon request from ERCOT or the PUCT;\n(f)\tAffirmation that no offered capacity from any site in an ERS Resource has been or will be committed to provide any other product, service, or program during any of the hours in the ERS Time Period in the Standard Contract Term for which the offer is submitted.  Such prohibited products, services, or programs include, but are not limited to, Ancillary Services, Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED), or TDSP standard offer programs.  As an exception to the foregoing, a QSE may offer a site to provide ERS for an ERS Time Period in the Standard Contract Term even if the QSE has an offer pending for that same site to serve as an MRA during that ERS Time Period and Standard Contract Term; however, if the site is selected to serve as an MRA it will not be permitted to serve as ERS during any ERS Time Period in the ERS Contract Term in which it is obligated to serve as an MRA;\n(g)\tAffirmation that the QSE and the controlling Entity the ERS Resource are familiar with any applicable federal, state or local environmental regulations that apply to the use of any generator in the provision of ERS, and that the use of such generator(s) to provide of ERS would not violate those regulations.  This provision applies to both ERS Generators and to the use of backup generation by ERS Loads; and\n(h)\tAffirmation that each offered ERS Resource satisfies at least one of the conditions set forth in paragraph (9) of Section 3.6.1, Load Resource Participation, and that all of the ERS Resource\u2019s offered Demand response capacity will be available if deployed by ERCOT during an emergency.\n(12)\tUpon request from a QSE, ERCOT shall provide the dates and times for any deployment events or tests of any ERS site during the previous three ERS Standard Contract Terms, provided that the QSE has obtained written authorization from the ERS site to obtain the information from ERCOT.  Such QSE requests shall include the following site-specific information: Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID), unique meter identifier (if applicable), or, if the site is in a Non-Opt-In Entity (NOIE) area, site name and site address.\n(13)\tSites associated with a Dynamically Scheduled Resource (DSR) may not participate in ERS.  Offers for Resources containing sites associated with a DSR will be rejected by ERCOT.  If ERCOT determines that any participating site is associated with a DSR, that site will be treated as removed from the Resource on the date the determination was made.  An ERS Resource\u2019s obligation will not change as a result of any such site removal.\n[NPRR1000:  Delete item (13) above upon system implementation and renumber accordingly.]\n(14)\tEach offer submitted by a QSE on behalf of an aggregated ERS Load on a weather-sensitive baseline shall include the QSE\u2019s projection of the maximum number of sites in the aggregation during the ERS Standard Contract Term.  ERCOT shall review this projection and the information provided regarding the initial size of each aggregated ERS Load and shall reject any offer on behalf of such an ERS Load if the maximum size of the ERS Load projected by the QSE would violate the limits of site participation growth described in paragraph (15) below.\n(15)\tA QSE may modify the population of an aggregated ERS Load on a weather-sensitive baseline once per month during an ERS Standard Contract Term via a process defined by ERCOT.  Such adjustments shall be effective on the first day of each month following the first month.  A fully validated ERS Offer form must be received by ERCOT no later than seven Business Days prior to the first day of the month for which is intended to be in effect.\n(a)\tDuring an ERS Standard Contract Term, a QSE may increase the number of sites in an aggregated ERS Load on a weather-sensitive baseline by no more than the greater of the following:\n(i)\t100% of the initial number of sites; or\n(ii)\tTwo MW times the QSE\u2019s projection of the maximum number of sites in the aggregation during the ERS Standard Contract Term, divided by the maximum MW capacity offered for any ERS Time Period for the aggregation.\n(b)\tAny sites added to an ERS Load on a weather-sensitive baseline are subject to the same requirements for historical meter data as the other sites in the aggregation, as described in paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.3.1.1.\n(16)\tFor each of the four ERS service types, an ERS Standard Contract Term may consist of a single ERS Contract Period or multiple non-overlapping ERS Contract Periods, as follows:  \n(a)\tIf no ERS Resources\u2019 obligations are exhausted for an ERS service type during an ERS Contract Period pursuant to Section 3.14.3.3, Emergency Response Service Provision and Technical Requirements, the ERS Contract Period for that ERS service type shall terminate at the end of the last Operating Day of the ERS Standard Contract Term.  \n(b)\tIf one or more ERS Resources\u2019 obligations in a given ERS service type are exhausted pursuant to Section 3.14.3.3, the ERS Contract Period for that ERS service type shall terminate at the end of the Operating Day during which the exhaustion occurred.  However, if ERS Resources participating in a service type remain deployed at the end of that Operating Day, the ERS Contract Period for that ERS service type shall terminate at the end of the Operating Day on which those ERS Resources are recalled.\n(c)\tIf an ERS Contract Period terminates as provided in paragraph (b) above, and one or more ERS Resources\u2019 obligations were not exhausted, a new ERS Contract Period for the ERS service type shall begin at hour ending 0100 on the following Operating Day.  This new ERS Contract Period shall terminate as provided in this Section.  \n(d)\tIf ERCOT elects pursuant to paragraph (b) above to renew the obligations of any ERS Resources whose obligations were entirely exhausted, a new ERS Contract Period for the ERS service type shall begin at hour ending 0100 on the Operating Day after ERCOT has notified QSEs that it has elected to renew the obligation.  If a new ERS Contract Period was initiated pursuant to paragraph (c) above on an Operating Day prior to ERCOT issuing a notice of renewal under this paragraph, that ERS Contract Period shall terminate at the end of the Operating Day on which ERCOT notified QSEs that the renewal will take place.  This new ERS Contract Period shall terminate as provided in this Section.\n(17)\tAn ERS Resource currently obligated to provide an ERS service type during an ERS Time Period and ERS Contract Period may be offered to provide service as an MRA during that same ERS Time Period in the ERS Contract Period.  If the ERS Resource is selected to provide service as an MRA during an ERS Time Period in the ERS Contract Period in which it is currently obligated to provide an ERS service type, the ERS Contract Period will be terminated for that ERS service type.  The ERS Contract Period for that ERS service type shall terminate at the end of the Operating Day that is five days before the first Operating Day the ERS Resource is obligated to provide service under the MRA Agreement.  However, if any ERS Resources participating in that ERS service type are currently deployed at the end of the Operating Day the ERS Contract Period is scheduled to terminate, then the ERS Resource\u2019s ERS Contract Period for that ERS service type shall continue until the end of the Operating Day on which all of the ERS Resources participating in that ERS service type have been recalled, at which time the ERS Contract Period will terminate.\n(18)\tERS Resources shall be obligated in ERS Contract Periods as follows:  \n(a)\tUnless an ERS Contract Period is terminated pursuant to paragraph (17) above, for the first ERS Contract Period in an ERS Standard Contract Term, all ERS Resources awarded by ERCOT shall be obligated.\n(b)\tERS Resources shall be obligated for 24 hours of cumulative deployment time for any ERS Contract Period during the December through March ERS Standard Contract Term.  The obligated cumulative deployment time for any ERS Contract Period during all other ERS Standard Contract Terms shall be 12 hours.\n(c)\tFor each of any subsequent ERS Contract Periods for a given ERS service type in an ERS Standard Contract Term, any ERS Resource with remaining obligation due to cumulative deployment time of less than the maximum deployment hours specified for the ERS Standard Contract Term in paragraph (b) above at the end of the last ERS Contract Period shall be obligated for only this remaining deployment time in the new ERS Contract Period.  \n(d)\tFor each of any subsequent ERS Contract Periods in an ERS Standard Contract Term, ERCOT may renew the obligations of certain ERS Resources as follows: \n(i)\tDuring the offer submission process, QSEs shall designate on the ERS offer form, which is posted on the ERCOT website, whether an ERS Resource elects to participate in renewal ERS Contract Periods (\u201crenewal opt-in\u201d).  Except as provided in paragraph (iv) below, this election is irrevocable once the ERS Resource has been committed for an ERS Standard Contract Term.\n(ii)\tIf the obligations of one or more ERS Resources are exhausted before the end of an ERS Standard Contract Term, ERCOT shall determine whether to include renewal opt-ins in the subsequent ERS Contract Period.  ERCOT may limit any renewal to one or more ERS Time Periods and/or a specified MW quantity in which obligations have been exhausted.  \n(iii)\tIf ERCOT decides to include renewal opt-ins in a subsequent ERS Contract Period, ERCOT shall promptly notify all ERS QSEs as to the ERS Time Periods and/or any specified MW quantity that it has elected to renew.\n(iv)\tBy the end of the second Business Day in any renewal ERS Contract Period, a QSE may revoke the renewal opt-in status of any of its committed ERS Resources for any subsequent ERS Contract Periods within that ERS Standard Contract Term.  ERCOT shall develop a method for QSEs to communicate such information.\n(v)\tBy the end of the third Business Day in any ERS Contract Period other than the first ERS Contract Period in an ERS Standard Contract Term, ERCOT shall communicate to QSEs a confirmation of the terms of participation for all of their committed ERS Resources.\n(19)\tIn any 12-month period beginning on December 1st and ending on November 30th, ERCOT shall not commit dollars toward ERS in excess of the ERS cost cap, except for the purpose of renewing ERS Resource obligations during a period where ERS has been exhausted.  ERCOT may determine cost limits for each ERS Standard Contract Term in order to ensure that the ERS cost cap is not exceeded.\n(20)\tIf a QSE offers a Weather-Sensitive ERS Load, selects a control group baseline for that ERS Load, and ERCOT determines that the magnitude of the offer relative to the baseline error will prevent accurate determination of the performance, ERCOT shall reject the offer.\n(21)\tERCOT shall reduce the available expenditure under the ERS cost cap by the value of the amount of ERS Self-Provision.  ERCOT shall value ERS Self-Provision at the clearing price multiplied by the total MW of ERS Self-Provision during each relevant ERS Time Period.\n(22)\tERCOT shall procure ERS Resources for each ERS Time Period using a clearing price.  The Emergency Response Service Procurement Methodology, posted on the ERCOT website, is an Other Binding Document that describes the methodology used by ERCOT to procure ERS.  ERCOT may consider geographic location and its effect on congestion in making ERS awards.  ERCOT may prorate the capacity awarded to an ERS Resource in an ERS Time Period if the capacity offered for that ERS Resource would cost more than the Emergency Response Service Procurement Methodology allows under the time period expenditure limit.  Such proration shall only be done if the QSE indicates on its offer for an ERS Resource that the QSE is willing to have the capacity prorated and also has indicated the lowest prorated capacity limit which is acceptable for that ERS Resource.  If proration would result in an award below an ERS Resource\u2019s designated prorated capacity limit or below the minimum MW offer applicable to the ERS service type as specified in paragraph (8) above, the offer will not be awarded.  \n(23)\tPayments and Self-Provision credits to QSEs representing ERS Resources are subject to adjustments as described in Section 8.1.3.3, Payment Reductions and Suspension of Qualification of Emergency Response Service Resources and/or their Qualified Scheduling Entities.  Deployment of ERS Resources will not result in additional payments other than any payment for which the QSE may be eligible through Real-Time energy imbalance or other ERCOT Settlement process. \n(24)\tQSEs representing ERS Resources selected to provide ERS shall execute a Standard Form Emergency Response Service Agreement, as provided in Section 22, Attachment G, Standard Form Emergency Response Service Agreement.\n3.14.3.2\tEmergency Response Service Self-Provision\n(1)\tQSEs may self-provide ERS.  A QSE electing to self-provide all or part of its ERS obligation shall provide ERCOT with the following, while adhering to a schedule published by ERCOT:\n(a)\tThe maximum MW of capacity the QSE is willing to self-provide for each ERS Time Period for each of the four ERS service types; and\n(b)\tA proxy Load Ratio Share (LRS) specific to each ERS Time Period for which an offer is submitted.  Proxy LRS shall be a number between zero and one and determined by the self-providing QSE to represent its estimate of its final LRS to be used in ERS Settlement.\n(2)\tERS Self-Provision Capacity Upper Limit is defined as the maximum level of self-provided ERS MW capacity for which a QSE may receive credit at Settlement for each ERS service type.  During the procurement process, a QSE may elect to use a proxy ERS Self-Provision Capacity Upper Limit (based on the proxy LRS it submitted) to reduce its ERS Self-Provision MW for each ERS service type.  After receiving ERS Self-Provision information, ERCOT will award offers for additional MWs of ERS capacity for each ERS service type such that the sum of the following does not exceed the total amount of ERS capacity ERCOT intends to procure for that ERS service type in any one ERS Time Period:  \n(a)\tERS capacity awarded through ERS competitive offers; and \n(b)\tERS capacity awarded through ERS Self-Provision offers, where for each self-providing QSE the self-provided capacity offer is the lesser of the amount offered or the QSE\u2019s proxy ERS Self-Provision Capacity Upper Limit.\n (3)\tThe calculations used to determine a QSE\u2019s proxy ERS Self-Provision Capacity Upper Limit for each ERS service type for the ERS procurement phase are the same as those used to determine the actual ERS Self-Provision Capacity Upper Limit for Settlement, as described in Section 6.6.11.1, Emergency Response Service Capacity Payments, except that:\n(a)\tOffered ERS capacity is substituted for delivered ERS capacity; and\n(b)\tA QSE\u2019s proxy LRS is substituted for its actual LRS.\n(4)\tERCOT shall compute and provide QSEs offering ERS Self-Provision their proxy ERS Self-Provision Capacity Upper Limit for each ERS service type.  A QSE may then reduce any or all of its self-provision offers such that its revised total ERS Self-Provision capacity is greater than or equal to its proxy ERS Self-Provision Capacity Upper Limit provided by ERCOT.  \n(5)\tA QSE with reduced ERS Self-Provision capacity shall notify ERCOT of the ERS Resources whose obligations are reduced and the quantity of the revised obligations.  The QSE must provide this information to ERCOT within two Business Days of receiving Notice of the reduced obligation.\n(6)\tIf a QSE reduces its ERS commitment according to these procedures, it will not be obligated to pay ERS charges so long as the ERS Self-Provision capacity it delivers is equal to or greater than its final LRS of the total ERS capacity delivered through offers and ERS Self-Provision, as described in paragraph (2) of Section 6.6.11.2, Emergency Response Service Capacity Charge. \n(7)\tA QSE opting for ERS Self-Provision may also offer separate capacity into ERS in the form of a priced offer in the same manner as any other QSE.\n(8)\tThe capacity obligation of a self-provided ERS Resource that is designated for renewal opt-in, as described in paragraph (18) of Section 3.14.3.1, Emergency Response Service Procurement, will be fixed at the original awarded MW level for any subsequent ERS Contract Periods in the ERS Standard Contract Term.\n3.14.3.3\tEmergency Response Service Provision and Technical Requirements\n(1)\tIf ERCOT deploys ERS, any ERS Resource that is contractually committed to provide the ERS service type deployed during the ERS Time Period that includes all or any part of the first interval of the Sustained Response Period must deploy.  If an ERS Resource does not have an obligation for any part of the first interval of the Sustained Response Period, the ERS Resource is not required to deploy at any time during the Sustained Response Period.\n(2)\tFor purposes of this paragraph, deployment obligation time is the cumulative time during the Sustained Response Period of an event during which an ERS Resource has an obligation.  Deployment obligation time does not include the ramp time.  An ERS Resource shall be subject to the maximum cumulative deployment obligation time for an ERS Contract Period as specified in paragraph (18)(b) of Section 3.14.3.1, Emergency Response Service Procurement, except that for ERS Resources that did not exhaust their obligations in a previous ERS Contract Period within the same ERS Standard Contract Term, the maximum deployment obligation time shall be the remaining deployment obligation time from the previous ERS Contract Period as provided by paragraph (18)(c) of Section 3.14.3.1.  Weather-Sensitive ERS test deployments do not contribute to the calculation of cumulative deployment obligation time.\n(3)\tUnless ERCOT has received a notice of unavailability in a format prescribed by ERCOT, ERCOT shall assume that a contracted ERS Resource is fully available to provide ERS.\n(4)\tQSEs and ERS Resources they represent shall meet the following technical requirements: \n(a)\tEach ERS Resource, including each member of an aggregated ERS Resource, must have an ESI ID or Resource ID (RID) and dedicated metering, as defined by ERCOT.  An ERS Resource located outside of a competitive service area may use a unique service identifier in lieu of an ESI ID or RID.  ERCOT shall analyze 15-minute interval meter data, adjusted for the deemed actual Distribution Loss Factors (DLFs), for each ERS Resource for purposes of offer analysis, availability and performance measurement.  ERS Resources behind a NOIE meter point shall arrange, preferably with the NOIE TDSP, to provide ERCOT with 15-minute interval meter data subject to ERCOT\u2019s specifications and approval.  ERS Resources behind a Private Use Network\u2019s Settlement Meter point shall provide ERCOT 15-minute interval meter data subject to ERCOT\u2019s specifications and approval.  All generators in an ERS Resource must have TDSP metering capable of measuring energy exported to the ERCOT System and TDSP metering capable of measuring energy imported from the ERCOT System.  The QSE must also ensure that interval metering is installed that measures the output of each site in the ERS Generator and that conforms with the requirements described in P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.142, Submetering for Apartments, Condominiums, and Mobile Home Parks.  Time stamps shall conform to the requirements in Section 10.9.2, TSP or DSP Metered Entities.  The ERS Resource associated with unique meters in competitive choice areas will be adjusted by the same DLFs as the ESI ID associated with that ERS Resource.  The ERS Resource associated with unique meters in NOIE areas will be adjusted based on a NOIE DSP DLF study submitted to ERCOT pursuant to paragraph (6) of Section 13.3, Distribution Losses.   \n(b)\tAn ERS Resource participating in ERS-10 must be capable of meeting its event performance obligations relevant to its assigned performance evaluation methodology within ten minutes of an ERCOT Dispatch Instruction to its QSE, and must be able to maintain such performance for the entire Sustained Response Period.  An ERS Resource participating in ERS-30 must be capable of meeting its event performance obligations relevant to its assigned performance evaluation methodology within 30 minutes of an ERCOT Dispatch Instruction to its QSE, and must be able to maintain such performance for the entire Sustained Response Period.\n(c)\tA QSE must be capable of communicating with its ERS Resources in sufficient time to ensure deployment as described in paragraph (b) above.\n(d)\tQSEs shall communicate to ERCOT, in a method prescribed by ERCOT, material changes in the availability status of their ERS Resources.\n(e)\tAn ERS Resource deployed for ERS must be able to return to a condition such that it is capable of meeting its ERS performance requirements within ten hours following a release Dispatch Instruction.\n(f)\tERS Resources and their QSEs are subject to qualification based on ERCOT\u2019s evaluation of their historical meter data and, if applicable, their historic performance in providing other comparable ERCOT services.  ERS Resources and their QSEs are subject to testing requirements as described in Section 8.1.3.2, Testing of Emergency Response Service Resources.  \n(g)\tERS Resources are not subject to the modeling, telemetry and COP requirements of other Resources.\n(5)\tThe contracted capacity of ERS Resources may not be used to provide Ancillary Services during a contracted ERS Time Period.  Nothing herein shall be construed to limit passive (voluntary) Load response, provided the ERS Resource meets its performance and availability requirements, as described in Section 8.1.3.1, Performance Criteria for Emergency Response Service Resources.\n(6)\tQSEs representing ERS Resources must meet the requirements specified in Section 8.1.3.3, Payment Reductions and Suspension of Qualification of Emergency Response Service Resources and/or their Qualified Scheduling Entities.\n3.14.3.4\tEmergency Response Service Reporting and Market Communications\n(1)\tERCOT shall review the effectiveness and benefits of ERS every 12 months from the start of the program year and report its findings to TAC no later than April 15 of each calendar year.\n(2)\tPrior to the start of the first ERS Contract Period in an ERS Standard Contract Term, and no later than the end of the third Business Day following the start of any subsequent ERS Contract Period in an ERS Standard Contract Term, ERCOT shall post on the ERCOT website the number of MW procured per ERS Time Period, the number and type of ERS Resources selected, and the projected total cost of ERS for that ERS Contract Period.\n(3)\tERCOT shall post the following documents to the MIS Certified Area for each of the four ERS service types:\n(a)\tERS Award Notification;\n(b)\tERS Resources Submission Form \u2013 Approved; \n(c)\tERS Resource Event Performance Summary;\n(d)\tERS Resource Availability Summary;\n(e)\tERS Test Portfolio;\n(f)\tERS Resource Test Results;\n(g)\tERS Pre-populated Resource Identification Forms;\n(h)\tERS Resource Group Assignments;\n(i)\tERS Resource Submission Form \u2013 Error Reports;\n(j)\tERS Preliminary Baseline Review Results;\n(k)\tERS QSE Portfolio Availability Summary;\n(l)\tERS QSE Portfolio Event Performance Summary;\n(m)\tERS Meter Data Error Report;\n(n)\tERS QSE-level Payment Details Report; and\n(o)\tERS Obligation Report for TDSPs.\n(4)\tAt least 24 hours before an ERS Standard Contract Term begins, or within 72 hours after the beginning of a new ERS Contract Period within an ERS Standard Contract Term, ERCOT shall post the information below to the MIS Certified Area for each affected TDSP:\n(a)\tA list of ERS Resources and members of aggregated ERS Resources located in the TDSP\u2019s service area that will be participating in ERS during the upcoming ERS Standard Contract Term; \n(b)\tThe name of the QSE representing each ERS Resource;\n(c)\tThe ERS service type provided by each ERS Resource for each ERS Time Period;\n(d)\tAll applicable ESI IDs or unique meter identifier associated with each ERS Resource; \n(e)\tEstimate of the ERS MW obligation by station code for TDSPs in competitive areas;\n(f)\tEstimate of the ERS MW obligation by zip code for TDSPs in NOIE areas; and \n(g)\tThe date(s) of the interconnection agreement(s) for each generator in any ERS Generator.\n(5)\tTDSPs shall maintain the confidentiality of the information provided pursuant to paragraph (4) above.\n(6)\tERCOT shall post to the ERCOT website the following information for each ERS offer 60 days after the first day of the ERS Standard Contract Term:\n(a)\tThe name of the QSE submitting the offer; \n(b)\tFor each ERS Time Period, the price and quantity offered, or if the offer is for self-provided ERS, the quantity offered and an indication that the MW will be self-provided; and\n(c)\tThe ERS service type.\n[NPRR885, NPRR995, NPRR1007, and NPRR1246:  Insert applicable portions of Sections 3.14.4 and 3.14.4.1 below upon system implementation for NPRR885 or NPRR995; or upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project for NPRR1007 and NPRR1246:]\n3.14.4\tMust-Run Alternative Service\n3.14.4.1\tOverview and Description of MRAs\n(1)\tSubject to approval by the ERCOT Board, ERCOT may procure Must-Run Alternative (MRA) Service as an alternative to contracting with an RMR Unit if ERCOT determines that the MRA Agreement(s) will, in whole or in part, address the reliability need identified in the RMR study in a more cost-effective manner.\n(2)\tERCOT will issue a request for proposal (RFP) to solicit offers from QSEs to provide MRA Service.  \n(a) \tA QSE may submit an offer in response to the RFP or enter into an MRA Agreement only if it meets all registration and qualification criteria in Section 16.2, Registration and Qualification of Qualified Scheduling Entities.  \n(b)\tQSEs whose offers for MRA Service are accepted will be paid according to their offers, subject to the terms of the RFP, MRA Agreement and ERCOT Protocols.

Amendments or modifications to such existing agreements shall also comply with this provision.\n(2)\tERCOT shall consider all comments received in response to the Notice and, to the extent time allows, discuss its acceptance or rejection of comments with the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and the ERCOT Board prior to execution.\n(3)\tERCOT shall provide Notice to all Market Participants following execution of any such agreement within two Business Days.\n3.24\tNotification of Low Coal and Lignite Inventory Levels\n(1)\tEach Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) representing a Generation Resource that uses coal or lignite as its primary fuel, except as provided in paragraph (2) below, shall notify ERCOT of the following:\n(a)\tIf the coal or lignite inventory level available for Real-Time operations is projected to fall below 15 days of operation at the High Sustained Limit (HSL) within the next 90 days, the QSE shall notify ERCOT within three days of such a projection and provide an explanation of any disruption to the coal or lignite supply.  Notifications to ERCOT should be via email, sent to FuelSupply@ERCOT.com.\n(b)\tIf the coal or lignite inventory level available for Real-Time operations is projected to fall below 10 days of operation at the HSL within the next 90 days, the QSE shall notify ERCOT immediately of such a projection, provide an explanation of any disruption to the coal or lignite supply, and provide daily inventory updates to ERCOT until the inventory level projection increases above 15 days.  Notifications to ERCOT should be via email, sent to FuelSupply@ERCOT.com.\n(2)\tThe requirements of paragraph (1) above do not apply to a QSE of a Generation Resource that uses coal or lignite as its primary fuel if the Generation Resource is located within 15 miles proximity of its fuel supply or was originally designed to be located within 15 miles proximity of its fuel supply and does not have the capability of storing onsite inventory for at least 30 days of operation at the HSL.  The QSE of a Generation Resource located within 15 miles of its fuel supply or that was originally designed to be located within 15 miles proximity of its fuel supply and does not have the capability of storing onsite inventory for at least 30 days of operation at the HSL must notify ERCOT of any disruption to the coal or lignite supply operations that could impact operations of the Generation Resource within two days of such disruption and provide an explanation of such disruption.  Notifications to ERCOT should be via email, sent to FuelSupply@ERCOT.com.\n3.25\tSubmission of Gas Supply Disruption\n(1)\tA Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) that represents a Generation Resource that relies on natural gas as the primary fuel source shall use reasonable efforts to notify ERCOT when:\n(a)\tA natural gas pipeline operator and/or natural gas fuel supplier issues either:\n(i)\tA written notification to the QSE, or an affiliate of the Generation Resource or QSE responsible for buying natural gas for the Generation Resource, in accordance with a firm contract, indicating that a gas supply disruption on a natural gas pipeline directly connected to the Generation Resource represented by the QSE is projected to occur or is currently in progress, resulting in curtailment of natural gas deliveries to the Generation Resource; or\n(ii)\tA written force majeure notice to the QSE, or an affiliate of the Generation Resource or QSE responsible for buying natural gas for the Generation Resource, on a natural gas pipeline directly connected to the Generation Resource represented by the QSE indicating a gas supply disruption; and\n(b)\tThe QSE determines that the Generation Resource\u2019s ability to supply electricity will be significantly limited by the gas supply disruption.  Notification under paragraph (1) will include a description of the potential impact to the operation of the Generation Resource.\n(2)\tNotwithstanding paragraph (1) above, a QSE that represents a Generation Resource that relies on natural gas as the primary fuel source shall ensure that the High Sustained Limit (HSL) and Current Operating Plan (COP) accurately reflect the amount of output the Generation Resource can produce based on an amount of natural gas that the QSE expects it can procure after exploring all accessible and reasonable options. \n(3)\tNotifications shall indicate which Generation Resources are reasonably expected to be impacted by the gas supply disruption based on the criteria above and the expected timeline of the disruption, based on available information. \n(4)\tNotifications to ERCOT shall be via email, sent to fuelsupply@ercot.com.",

co-optimized market in the Day-Ahead for Ancillary Service capacity and forward financial energy and congestion transactions.  \n[NPRR1008:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]\n(1)\tThe Day-Ahead Market (DAM) is a daily, co-optimized market in the Day-Ahead for forward financial energy, Ancillary Services, and congestion transactions.\n(2)\tParticipation in the DAM is voluntary. \n(3)\tDAM energy settlements use DAM Settlement Point Prices that are calculated for Resource Nodes, Load Zones, and Hubs for a one-hour Settlement Interval using the Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) from DAM.  In contrast, the Real-Time energy settlements use Real-Time Settlement Point Prices that are calculated for Resource Nodes, Load Zones, and Hubs for a 15-minute Settlement Interval.  \n(4)\tTo the extent that the ERCOT CEO or designee determines that Market Participant activities have produced an outcome inconsistent with the efficient operation of the ERCOT administered markets as defined in subsection (c)(2) of P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.503, Oversight of Wholesale Market Participants, ERCOT may prohibit the activity by Notice for a period beginning on the date of the Notice and ending no later than 45 days after the date of the Notice.  ERCOT may issue subsequent Notices on the same activity.  The ERCOT CEO may deem any Nodal Protocol Revision Request (NPRR) designed to correct the activity or issues affecting the activity as Urgent pursuant to Section 21.5, Urgent and Board Priority Nodal Protocol Revision Requests and System Change Requests.   \n4.1.1\tDay-Ahead Timeline Summary\n(1)\tThe figure below shows the major activities that occur in the Day-Ahead:\n\n[NPRR1008:  Replace the figure above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]",

In such an event, ERCOT shall immediately issue an Advisory and notify all Qualified Scheduling Entities (QSEs) of the following:  \n(a)\tDetails of the affected timing and procedures;\n(b)\tDetails of interim requirements, if any exist;\n(c)\tAn estimate of the period for which the interim requirements apply; and\n(d)\tReasons for the temporary variation.\n(2)\tSubject to the principles set forth in paragraph (3) below, ERCOT may omit any procedure or take any manual action necessary to ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that the DAM clearing process completes by 1900 in the Day-Ahead.  Should ERCOT omit any such procedure or take any such manual action, ERCOT will issue a Market Notice no later than 1700 Central Prevailing Time (CPT) on the next Business Day that details the omitted procedures or manual actions taken by ERCOT and ERCOT\u2019s explanation as to why they were necessary.  If the manual action taken by ERCOT requires ERCOT to omit bids or offers submitted by a particular QSE, ERCOT will provide notification to that QSE prior to taking the manual action, so long as providing such notice will not delay completion of the DAM beyond 1900 in the Day-Ahead.  \n(3)\tWhen omitting a procedure or taking a manual action under paragraph (2) above, ERCOT will act in accordance with the following principles:  \n(a)\tERCOT will only act in cases in which it reasonably believes that intervention is necessary in order to complete DAM by 1900;\n(b)\tERCOT will seek to minimize impacts to Market Participants and will only remove transactions from the DAM as a last resort; when ERCOT believes a QSE\u2019s transactions need to be removed, either in whole or in part, in order to complete the DAM clearing process, ERCOT will prioritize the removal in reverse order based on submittal time, where the QSE\u2019s most recently submitted transactions are prioritized before the removal of the earliest submitted transactions; however, the number of transactions removed will be at ERCOT\u2019s discretion, subject to the principles set forth in this paragraph; \n(c)\tApproval to act will be obtained from the applicable ERCOT executive or designee; and\n(d)\tERCOT will not publish a DAM in which no transmission constraints are evaluated.\n(4)\tShould ERCOT omit a procedure or take manual action pursuant to paragraph (2) above, and a Market Participant is directly impacted by such ERCOT action or omission, the Market Participant may seek relief as specifically provided for under Section 9.14.10, Settlement for Market Participants Impacted by Omitted Procedures or Manual Actions to Resolve the DAM.  A Market Participant will only be entitled relief upon ERCOT\u2019s determination that ERCOT\u2019s action or omission pursuant to paragraph (2) above was the sole cause of the Market Participant\u2019s injury, and the monetary value of the direct impact can be accurately determined by ERCOT.  Such relief is not available in the case that ERCOT aborts all or part of the Day-Ahead process.  A Market Participant may only seek relief due to ERCOT\u2019s omission of a procedure or manual action under paragraph (2) above in the following circumstances:\n(a)\tERCOT removed the Market Participant\u2019s bid(s) or offer(s); \n(b)\tERCOT failed to award the Market Participant\u2019s bid(s) or offer(s); or\n(c)\tERCOT de-energized the Market Participant\u2019s Resource(s) in the base case.\n(5)\tIf ERCOT is unable to execute the Day-Ahead process prior to 1900 in the Day-Ahead, ERCOT may abort all or part of the Day-Ahead process and require all schedules and trades to be submitted in the Adjustment Period.  In that event, ERCOT shall issue a Watch and notify all QSEs of the following:\n(a)\tDetails of the affected timing and procedures;\n(b)\tDetails of any interim requirements, including the requirements described in Section 5.2.2.2, RUC Process Timeline After an Aborted Day-Ahead Market;\n(c)\tAn estimate of the period for which the interim requirements apply; and\n[NPRR1008:  Delete items (b) and (c) above upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project and renumber accordingly.]\n(d)\tReasons for the temporary variation.\n(6)\tIf ERCOT is unable to operate the Adjustment Period process, then ERCOT may abort the Adjustment Period process and operate under its Operating Period procedures.\n4.2\tERCOT Activities in the Day-Ahead\n4.2.1\tAncillary Service Plan and Ancillary Service Obligation\n4.2.1.1\tAncillary Service Plan\n(1)\tERCOT shall analyze the expected Load conditions for the Operating Day and develop an Ancillary Service Plan that identifies the Ancillary Service MW necessary for each hour of the Operating Day.  The MW of each Ancillary Service required may vary from hour to hour depending on ERCOT System conditions.  ERCOT must post the Ancillary Service Plan to the ERCOT website by 0600 of the Day-Ahead.\n(2)\tIf ERCOT determines that an Emergency Condition may exist that would adversely affect ERCOT System reliability, it may change the percentage of Load Resources that are allowed to provide ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service (ECRS) and Responsive Reserve (RRS) from the monthly amounts determined previously, as described in Section 3.16, Standards for Determining Ancillary Service Quantities, and must post any change in the percentage to the ERCOT website by 0600 of the Day-Ahead.  \n(3)\tERCOT shall determine the total required amount of each Ancillary Service under Section 3.16, or use its operational judgment and experience to change the daily quantity of each required Ancillary Service.  \n(4)\tERCOT shall include in the Ancillary Service Plan enough capacity to automatically control frequency with the intent to meet North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards.\n(5)\tOnce specified by ERCOT for an hour and published on the ERCOT website, Ancillary Service quantity requirements for an Operating Day may not be decreased. \n[NPRR1008:  Insert paragraph (6) below upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]\n(6)\tERCOT shall create an Ancillary Service Demand Curve (ASDC) for each Ancillary Service as described in Section 4.4.12, Determination of Ancillary Service Demand Curves.  ERCOT must post the ASDCs to the ERCOT website by 0600 of the Day-Ahead.  If ERCOT changes the Ancillary Service Plan per Section 6.4.9.1.2, Changes to Operating Day Ancillary Service Plan, the ASDCs reflecting the change to the Ancillary Service Plan will be posted to the ERCOT website.\n4.2.1.2\tAncillary Service Obligation Assignment and Notice\n(1)\tERCOT shall assign part of the Ancillary Service Plan quantity, by service, by hour, to each Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) based on its Load Serving Entity (LSE) Load Ratio Shares (LRSs) (including the shares for Direct Current Tie (DC Tie) exports) aggregated by hour to the QSE level.  If the resultant QSE-level share is negative, the QSE\u2019s share will be set to zero and all other QSE shares will be adjusted on a pro rata basis such that the sum of all shares is equal to one.  The resulting Ancillary Service quantity for each QSE, by service, by hour, is called its Ancillary Service Obligation.  ERCOT shall base the QSE Ancillary Service allocation on the QSE to LSE relationships for the operating date and on the hourly LSE LRSs from the Real-Time Market (RTM) data used for Initial Settlement for the same hour and day of the week, for the most recent day for which Initial Settlement data is available, multiplied by the quantity of that service required in the Day-Ahead Ancillary Service Plan.  The Ancillary Service Obligation defined shall be adjusted based on the most current real time settlement and resettlement data for the Operating Day for which the Ancillary Service was procured. \n(2)\tBy 0600 of the Day-Ahead, ERCOT shall notify each QSE of its Ancillary Service Obligation for each service and for each hour of the Operating Day.\n(3)\tBy 0600 of the Day-Ahead, ERCOT shall post on the Market Information System (MIS) Certified Area each QSE\u2019s LRS used for the Ancillary Service Obligation calculation.\n[NPRR1008 and NPRR1245:  Replace Section 4.2.1.2 above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]\n4.2.1.2\tAncillary Service Obligation Assignment and Notice\n(1)\tERCOT shall assign part of the Ancillary Service Plan quantity, or total Ancillary Service procurement quantity, if different, by service, by hour, to each Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) based on its Load Serving Entity (LSE) Load Ratio Shares (LRSs) (including the shares for Direct Current Tie (DC Tie) exports) aggregated by hour to the QSE level.  If the resultant QSE-level share is negative, the QSE\u2019s share will be set to zero and all other QSE shares will be adjusted on a pro rata basis such that the sum of all shares is equal to one.  The resulting Ancillary Service quantity for each QSE, by service, by hour, is called its Ancillary Service Obligation.  ERCOT shall base the QSE Ancillary Service allocation on the QSE to LSE relationships for the operating date and on the hourly LSE LRSs from the Real-Time Market (RTM) data used for Initial Settlement for the same hour and day of the week, for the most recent day for which Initial Settlement data is available, multiplied by the quantity of that service required in the Day-Ahead Ancillary Service Plan.  The Ancillary Service Obligation defined shall be adjusted based on the most current real time settlement and resettlement data for the Operating Day for which the Ancillary Service was procured.\n(2)\tBy 0600 of the Day-Ahead, ERCOT shall notify each QSE of its advisory Ancillary Service Obligation for each service and for each hour of the Operating Day, based on the Ancillary Service Plan, as well as that QSE\u2019s proportional limit for any Self-Arranged Ancillary Services as set forth in Section 3.16, Standards for Determining Ancillary Service Quantities.\n(3)\tBy 0600 of the Day-Ahead, ERCOT shall post on the Market Information System (MIS) Certified Area each QSE\u2019s LRS used for both the advisory and final Ancillary Service Obligation calculations. \n(4)\tAfter DAM has published, ERCOT shall notify each QSE of its final Ancillary Service Obligation based on the total DAM Ancillary Service procurement quantity, comprised of DAM Ancillary Service awards and Self-Arranged Ancillary Service Quantities for each service and for each hour of the Operating Day.\n4.2.2\tWind-Powered Generation Resource Production Potential\n(1)\tERCOT shall produce and update hourly a Short-Term Wind Power Forecast (STWPF) that provides a rolling 168-hour hourly forecast of wind production potential for each Wind-powered Generation Resource (WGR).  ERCOT shall produce and post to the ERCOT website every five minutes an Intra-Hour Wind Power Forecast (IHWPF) by wind region that provides a forecast of ERCOT-wide wind production potential for each five-minute interval over the next two hours from each forecast model.  The posting shall indicate which forecast model was being used by ERCOT for Generation To Be Dispatched (GTBD) calculation purposes.  ERCOT shall produce and update an hourly Total ERCOT Wind Power Forecast (TEWPF) providing a probability distribution of the hourly production potential from all wind-power in ERCOT for each of the next 168 hours.  Each Generation Entity that owns a WGR shall install and telemeter to ERCOT the site-specific meteorological information that ERCOT determines is necessary to produce the STWPF and TEWPF forecasts.  ERCOT shall establish procedures specifying the accuracy requirements of WGR meteorological information telemetry. \n[NPRR1029:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(1)\tERCOT shall produce and update hourly a Short-Term Wind Power Forecast (STWPF) that provides a rolling 168-hour hourly forecast of wind production potential for each Wind-powered Generation Resource (WGR) and for each wind generation component of a DC-Coupled Resource.  ERCOT shall produce and post to the ERCOT website every five minutes an Intra-Hour Wind Power Forecast (IHWPF) by wind region that provides a forecast of ERCOT-wide wind production potential for each five-minute interval over the next two hours from each forecast model.  The posting shall indicate which forecast model was being used by ERCOT for Generation To Be Dispatched (GTBD) calculation purposes.  ERCOT shall produce and update an hourly Total ERCOT Wind Power Forecast (TEWPF) providing a probability distribution of the hourly production potential from all wind-power in ERCOT for each of the next 168 hours.  A Resource Entity with a WGR or DC-Coupled Resource that has a wind generation component shall install equipment to enable telemetry of site-specific meteorological information that ERCOT determines is necessary to produce the STWPF and TEWPF forecasts, and the Resource Entity\u2019s QSE shall telemeter such information and Resource status information to ERCOT.

Only one confirmed Ancillary Service Trade is allowed for the same buying and selling QSEs for each type of Ancillary Service for each hour.\n(2)\tWhen an Ancillary Service Trade is reported to ERCOT, ERCOT shall notify both the buying and selling QSEs by using the Messaging System if available and the MIS Certified Area.  \n(3)\tERCOT shall continuously validate Ancillary Service Trades and continuously display on the MIS Certified Area information that allows any QSE named in an Ancillary Service Trade to view its confirmed and unconfirmed Ancillary Service Trades.  ERCOT shall also post to the MIS Certified Area any unconfirmed Ancillary Service Trades for QSEs on an hourly basis for all remaining hours of the current Operating Day and all hours of the next Operating Day. \n(4)\tThe QSE that first reports the Ancillary Service Trade to ERCOT is deemed to have confirmed the Ancillary Service Trade unless it subsequently affirmatively rejects it.  The QSE that first reports an Ancillary Service Trade may reject, edit, or delete an Ancillary Service Trade that its counterpart has not confirmed.  The counterpart is deemed to have confirmed the Ancillary Service Trade when it submits an identical Ancillary Service Trade.  After both the buyer and seller have confirmed an Ancillary Service Trade, either party may reject it at any time, but the rejection is effective only for any ERCOT process for which the deadline for reporting Ancillary Service Trades has not yet passed.  \n4.4.7.4\tAncillary Service Supply Responsibility\n(1)\tA QSE\u2019s Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility is the net amount of Ancillary Service capacity that the QSE is obligated to deliver to ERCOT, by hour and service type.  The Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility is the difference in MW, by hour and service type, between the amounts specified in items (a) and (b) defined as follows:\n(a)\tThe sum of:\n(i)\tThe QSE\u2019s Self-Arranged Ancillary Service Quantity; plus\n(ii)\tThe total (in MW) of Ancillary Service Trades for which the QSE is the seller; plus\n(iii)\tAwards to the QSE of Ancillary Service Offers in the DAM; plus\n(iv)\tAwards to the QSE of Ancillary Service Offers in the SASM; plus\n(v)\tRUC-committed Ancillary Service quantities to the QSE from its Resources committed by the RUC process to provide Ancillary Service; and \n(b)\tThe sum of:\n(i)\tThe total Ancillary Service Trades for which the QSE is the buyer; plus\n(ii)\tThe total Ancillary Service capacity identified as the QSE\u2019s failure to provide as described in Section 6.4.9.1.3, Failure to Provide Ancillary Service; plus\n(iii)\tThe total Ancillary Service capacity identified as the QSE\u2019s infeasible Ancillary Service, as described in Section 6.4.9.1.2, Replacement of Infeasible Ancillary Service Due to Transmission Constraints; plus\n(iv)\tThe total Ancillary Service capacity identified as the QSE\u2019s reconfiguration amount as described in Section 6.4.9.2, Supplemental Ancillary Services Market.\n(2)\tA QSE may only use a RUC-committed Resource during that Resource\u2019s RUC-Committed Interval to meet the QSE\u2019s Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility if the Resource has been committed by the RUC process to provide Ancillary Service.  The QSE shall only provide from the RUC-committed Resource the exact amount and type of Ancillary Service for which it was committed by RUC.\n(3)\tBy 1430 in the Day-Ahead, the QSE must notify ERCOT, in the QSE\u2019s COP, which Resources represented by the QSE will provide the Ancillary Service capacity necessary to meet the QSE\u2019s Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility, specified by Resource, hour, and service type.  The DAM Ancillary Service awards are Resource-specific; the QSE must include those DAM awards in its COP, and the QSE may not change that Resource-specific DAM award information until after 1600 under the conditions set out in Section 3.9, Current Operating Plan (COP). \n(4)\tSection 6.4.9.1.3 specifies what happens if the QSE fails to provide its Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility.\n(5)\tA QSE\u2019s Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility must be met by identified Resources that are qualified to provide the Ancillary Service, per Section 8.1.1.2.1, Ancillary Service Technical Requirements and Qualification Criteria and Test Methods, and available to act on Dispatch Instructions.\n[NPRR1008:  Delete Section 4.4.7.4 above upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project.]\n4.4.8\tRMR Offers\n(1)\tERCOT shall decide, in its sole discretion, to commit a Reliability Must-Run (RMR) Unit using the DRUC or HRUC process only when it has determined that the RMR Unit is likely to be needed in Real-Time for reliability reasons, taking into consideration whether SCED will solve transmission constraints without the RMR Resource, contractual constraints on the Resource, and any other adverse effects on the RMR Unit that may occur as the result of the dispatch of the RMR Resource.\n(a)\tIf ERCOT has determined that an RMR Unit will be needed in Real-Time to resolve a transmission constraint, then ERCOT shall manually commit the Resource for the capacity required to resolve the transmission constraint using the DRUC or HRUC process. \n(b)\tERCOT may submit Energy Offer Curves at the SWCAP in $/MWh on behalf of RMR Units committed in the DRUC or HRUC, and subsequently available for Dispatch by SCED, unless ERCOT declares a Market Suspension, in which case no Energy Offer Curves will be submitted, and ERCOT may, at its discretion, Dispatch RMR Units to restore the ERCOT Transmission Grid.\n[NPRR1008:  Replace paragraph (b) above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]\n(b)\tERCOT may submit Energy Offer Curves at the effective Value of Lost Load (VOLL) in $/MWh on behalf of RMR Units committed in the DRUC or HRUC, and subsequently available for Dispatch by SCED, unless ERCOT declares a Market Suspension, in which case no Energy Offer Curves will be submitted, and ERCOT may, at its discretion, Dispatch RMR Units to restore the ERCOT Transmission Grid.\n(c)\tRMR offers shall be treated as if they were Resource offers for purposes of posting under Section 3.2.5, Publication of Resource and Load Information.\n4.4.9\tEnergy Offers and Bids\n4.4.9.1\tThree-Part Supply Offers\n(1)\tA Three-Part Supply Offer consists of a Startup Offer, a Minimum-Energy Offer, and an Energy Offer Curve.  ERCOT must validate each Startup Offer, Minimum-Energy Offer, and Energy Offer Curve before it can be used in any ERCOT process.\n(2)\tThe DAM uses all three parts of the Three-Part Supply Offer and also uses Energy Offer Curves submitted without a Startup Offer and without a Minimum-Energy Offer.  The RUC only uses the Startup Offer and the Minimum-Energy Offer components for determining RUC commitments, but the Energy Offer Curve may be used in Settlement to claw back some or all of a RUC-committed Resource\u2019s energy payments.  The Energy Offer Curve may also be used by SCED in Real-Time Operations. \n(3)\tA QSE may submit an Energy Offer Curve without also submitting a Startup Offer and a Minimum-Energy Offer for the DAM and during the Adjustment Period, but only Three-Part Supply Offers are used in the RUC process.  A QSE that submits an Energy Offer Curve without also submitting a Startup Offer and a Minimum-Energy Offer is considered not to be offering the Resource into the RUC, but that does not prevent the Resource from being committed in the RUC process like any other Resource that does not submit an offer in the RUC.\n(a)\tA QSE that submits an Energy Offer Curve without a Startup Offer and a Minimum-Energy Offer for the DAM for any given hour will be considered by the DAM to be self-committed for that hour, as long as an Ancillary Service Offer for Off-Line Non-Spin Service was not also submitted for that hour.\n(b)\tA Combined Cycle Generation Resource will be considered by the DAM to be self-committed if:\n(i)\tIts QSE submits an Energy Offer Curve without a Startup Offer and a Minimum-Energy Offer for the DAM for that Combined Cycle Generation Resource and no other Combined Cycle Generation Resource within the Combined Cycle Train; and\n(ii)\tIts QSE submits no Ancillary Service Offer for Off-Line Non-Spin for any Combined Cycle Generation Resource within the Combined Cycle Train.\n(c)\tWhen the DAM considers a self-committed offer for clearing, the Resource constraints identified in paragraph (4)(c)(ii) of Section 4.5.1, DAM Clearing Process, other than HSL, are ignored.\n(4)\tFor any hours in which the Resource is not RUC-committed, ERCOT shall consider all Three-Part Supply Offers in the RUC process until: \n(a) \tThe QSE withdraws the offer; or \n(b) \tThe offer expires by its terms. \n4.4.9.2\tStartup Offer and Minimum-Energy Offer \n(1)\tThe Startup Offer component represents all costs incurred by a Generation Resource in starting up and reaching its LSL.  The Minimum-Energy Offer component represents a proxy for the costs incurred by a Resource in producing energy at the Resource\u2019s LSL.  \n[NPRR1014:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(1)\tThe Startup Offer component represents all costs incurred by a Generation Resource in starting up and reaching its LSL.  The Minimum-Energy Offer component represents a proxy for the costs incurred by a Resource in producing energy at the Resource\u2019s LSL.   Startup Offers and Minimum-Energy Offers are not applicable to ESRs.\n4.4.9.2.1\tStartup Offer and Minimum-Energy Offer Criteria \n(1)\tEach Startup Offer and Minimum-Energy Offer must be reported by a QSE and must include the following information:\n(a)\tThe selling QSE;\n(b)\tThe Resource represented by the QSE from which the offer would be supplied;\n(c)\tThe Resource\u2019s hot, intermediate, and cold Startup Offer in dollars; \n(d)\tThe Resource\u2019s Minimum-Energy Offer in dollars per MWh; \n(e)\tThe first and last hour of the Startup and Minimum-Energy Offers\n(f)\tThe expiration time and date of the offer; \n(g)\tPercentage of the Fuel Index Price (FIP) to the extent that the startup and minimum energy will be supplied by gas to determine the offer cap; and\n(h)\tPercentage of the Fuel Oil Price (FOP) to the extent that the startup and minimum energy will be supplied by oil to determine the offer cap.\n(2)\tValid Startup Offers and Minimum-Energy Offers (which must be part of a Three-Part Supply Offer) must be received before 1000 for the effective DAM and DRUC. \n(3)\tA QSE may update and submit a Startup Offer and/or Minimum-Energy Offer for a Resource during the Adjustment Period for any hours in which the Resource is not DAM- or RUC-committed before the offer is updated or submitted.  \n(4)\tThe Resource\u2019s Startup Offer must not be greater than 200% of the Resource Category Generic Startup Cost for that type of Resource listed in Section 4.4.9.2.3, Startup Offer and Minimum-Energy Offer Generic Caps, unless ERCOT has approved verifiable Resource-specific startup costs for that Resource, under Section 4.4.9.2.4, Verifiable Startup Offer and Minimum-Energy Offer Caps, in which case the Resource\u2019s Startup Offer must not be greater than 200% of those approved verifiable Resource-specific Startup Costs.\n(5)\tThe Resource\u2019s Minimum-Energy Offer must not be greater than 200% of the Resource Category Generic Minimum-Energy Cost for that type of Resource listed in Section 4.4.9.2.3 unless ERCOT has approved verifiable Resource-specific minimum-energy costs for that Resource, under Section 4.4.9.2.4 in which case the Resource\u2019s Minimum-Energy Offer must not be greater than 200% of those approved verifiable Resource-specific minimum-energy costs.\n(6)\tPrior to 1000 for the effective DAM, a QSE may submit and update a Three-Part Supply Offer for a Resource for any hours which were Weekly Reliability Unit Commitment (WRUC)-instructed.\n4.4.9.2.2\tStartup Offer and Minimum-Energy Offer Validation \n(1)\tA valid Startup Offer and Minimum-Energy Offer is an offer that ERCOT has determined meets the criteria listed in Section 4.4.9.2.1, Startup Offer and Minimum-Energy Offer Criteria, and that are part of a Three-Part Supply Offer for which the Energy Offer Curve has also been validated. \n(2)\tERCOT shall continuously display on the MIS Certified Area information that allows any QSE submitting a Startup Offer and Minimum-Energy Offer to view its valid Startup Offers and Minimum-Energy Offers. \n(3)\tERCOT shall notify the QSE submitting a Startup Offer and Minimum-Energy Offer (which must be part of a Three-Part Supply Offer) if the offer was rejected or was considered invalid for any reason.  The QSE may then resubmit the offer within the appropriate market timeline. \n(4)\tWhere a Split Generation Resource has submitted a Startup Offer and Minimum-Energy Offer, ERCOT shall validate the offers in accordance with Section 3.8, Special Considerations.\n4.4.9.2.3\tStartup Offer and Minimum-Energy Offer Generic Caps \n(1)\tThe Resource Category Startup Offer Generic Cap, by applicable Resource category, is determined by the following Operations and Maintenance (O&M) costs by Resource category: \nResource Category\tO&M Costs ($)\nNuclear, coal, lignite and hydro\t7,200\nCombined Cycle Generation Resource with a combustion turbine \u2265 90 MW, as determined by the largest combustion turbine in the Combined Cycle Generation Resource and for each combustion turbine in the Combined Cycle Generation Resource\t6,810 \nCombined Cycle Generation Resource with a combustion turbine < 90 MW, as determined by the largest combustion turbine in the Combined Cycle Generation Resource and for each combustion turbine in the Combined Cycle Generation Resource\t6,810\nGas steam supercritical boiler\t4,800\nGas steam reheat boiler \t3,000\nGas steam non-reheat or boiler w/o air-preheater \t2,310\nSimple cycle greater than 90 MW \t5,000\nSimple cycle less than or equal to 90 MW\t2,300\nReciprocating Engines\t$58 /MW * the average of the seasonal net max sustainable ratings\nRMR Resource\tNot Applicable\nWind generation Resources\t0\nPhotoVoltaic Generation Resources (PVGRs)\t0\nAny Resources not defined above\t0",

A QSE may file verifiable unit-specific costs for a Resource at any time, but it is not required to file those costs only because of a DAM commitment. The most recent approved verifiable costs on file must be used going forward.\n4.4.9.3\tEnergy Offer Curve\n(1)\tThe Energy Offer Curve represents the QSE\u2019s willingness to sell energy at or above a certain price and at a certain quantity in the DAM or its willingness to be dispatched by SCED in Real-Time Operations.   \n(2)\tA QSE may submit Resource-specific Energy Offer Curves to ERCOT.  Such Energy Offer Curves will be bounded in the DAM for each Operating Hour by the LSL and HSL of the Generation Resource specified in the COP, and bounded in SCED by the LSL and HSL of the Generation Resource as shown by telemetry. \n(3)\tEnergy Offer Curves remain active for the offered period until automatically inactivated by the software at the offer expiration time selected by the QSE.\n(4)\tFor any Operating Hour, the QSE for a Resource may submit or change Energy Offer Curve information at any time prior to SCED execution, except for the percentage of FIP and percentage of FOP, and SCED will use the latest updated Energy Offer Curve available in the system.  The QSE must provide a brief freeform reason at the time of the submission of the Energy Offer Curve if submitted after the end of the Adjustment Period.  For the percentage FIP and percentage of FOP within the Energy Offer Curve, submissions and updates must be received by ERCOT\u2019s systems in the Adjustment Period.

The methodology for determining the DASWCAP and RTSWCAP is as follows: \n(a)\tThe DASWCAP and RTSWCAP shall be set equal to the respective High System-Wide Offer Cap (HCAP).  Additionally, the Value of Lost Load (VOLL) used to determine the ASDCs for DAM and RTM shall be set to the HCAP for DAM.  These caps shall be maintained at these levels until either of the following criteria are met:\n(i)\tIf the sum of the Real-Time Market (RTM) System Lambda and Real-Time Reliability Deployment Price Adder for Energy is greater than or equal to the HCAP for DAM for a total of 12 hours within a rolling 24-hour period, ERCOT will activate the Emergency Pricing Program (EPP) and the DASWCAP and VOLL used to determine the ASDCs for DAM and RTM will be set to ECAP starting at the beginning of the next Operating Hour that ERCOT can implement the change.  Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED)-level data, time-weight averaged to a 15-minute Settlement Interval equivalent, will be used to make this determination.  The EPP will remain active until the later of the following, at which point the ECAP Effective Period will end at the beginning of the next Operating Hour:\n(A)\t24 hours after the initial setting of these values to ECAP; or\n(B)\t24 hours after ERCOT exits Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) conditions, if ERCOT entered into or remained in EEA while the EPP was active.  If ERCOT reenters EEA conditions within 24 hours, then the ECAP Effective Period will continue for 24 hours after the latest exit from EEA conditions.\n(ii)\tIf the Peaker Net Margin (PNM) exceeds the PNM threshold per MW-year during a year, the DASWCAP and the VOLL used to determine the ASDCs for DAM and RTM shall be set per the schedule in Section 4.4.11.1, Scarcity Pricing Mechanism.\n(b)\tERCOT shall issue operations notices when the ECAP Effective Period begins and ends.

In no event shall the extension exceed more than one hour from when the processing delay is resolved.\n(2)\tERCOT shall complete a Day-Ahead Simultaneous Feasibility Test (SFT).  This test uses the Day-Ahead Updated Network Model topology and evaluates all Congestion Revenue Rights (CRRs) for feasibility to determine hourly oversold quantities.\n(3)\tThe purpose of the DAM is to economically and simultaneously clear offers and bids described in Section 4.4, Inputs into DAM and Other Trades.\n(4)\tThe DAM uses a multi-hour mixed integer programming algorithm to maximize bid-based revenues minus the offer-based costs over the Operating Day, subject to security and other constraints, and ERCOT Ancillary Service procurement requirements.  \n(a)\tThe bid-based revenues include revenues from DAM Energy Bids and Point-to-Point (PTP) Obligation bids. \n(b)\tThe offer-based costs include costs from the Startup Offer, Minimum Energy Offer, and Energy Offer Curve of any Resource that submitted a Three-Part Supply Offer, DAM Energy-Only Offers and Ancillary Service Offers.  \n(c)\tSecurity constraints specified to prevent DAM solutions that would overload the elements of the ERCOT Transmission Grid include the following: \n(i)\tTransmission constraints \u2013 transfer limits on energy flows through the ERCOT Transmission Grid, e.g., thermal or stability limits.

ERCOT may not buy more of one Ancillary Service in place of the quantity of a different service.\n(5)\tERCOT shall determine the appropriate Load distribution factors to allocate offers, bids, and source and sink of CRRs at a Load Zone across the energized power flow buses that are modeled with Load in that Load Zone.  The non-Private Use Network Load distribution factors are based on historical State Estimator hourly distribution using a proxy day methodology representing anticipated weather conditions.  The Private Use Network Load distribution factors are based on an estimated Load value considering historical net consumption at all Private Use Networks.  If ERCOT decides, in its sole discretion, to change the Load distribution factors for reasons such as anticipated weather events or holidays, ERCOT shall select a State Estimator hourly distribution from a proxy day reasonably reflecting the anticipated Load in the Operating Day.  ERCOT may also modify the Load distribution factors to account for predicted differences in network topology between the proxy day and Operating Day.  ERCOT shall develop a methodology, subject to Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) approval, to describe the modification of the proxy day bus-load distribution for this purpose.\n[NPRR1004:  Replace paragraph (5) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(5)\tERCOT shall determine the appropriate Load distribution factors to allocate offers, bids, and source and sink of PTP Obligations at a Load Zone across the energized power flow buses that are modeled with Load in that Load Zone.

ERCOT shall seek ERCOT Board review of prices if the change in DAM Settlement Statement(s) would result in the absolute value impact to any single Counter-Party, based on the sum of all original DAM Settlement Statement amounts of Market Participants assigned to the Counter-Party, to be greater than:\n(i)\t2% and also greater than $20,000; or\n(ii)\t20% and also greater than $2,000. \n(c)\tThe

ERCOT, in its sole discretion, may conduct a RUC at any time to evaluate and resolve reliability issues.\n(3)\tThe DRUC must be run after the close of the Day-Ahead Market (DAM). \n(4)\tThe DRUC uses Three-Part Supply Offers, capped at the maximum of generic or verifiable minimum energy and Startup Costs, submitted before the DAM by Qualified Scheduling Entities (QSEs) that were considered in the DAM but not awarded in the DAM.  A QSE may not submit a Three-Part Supply Offer to be considered in the DRUC unless the offer was also submitted for consideration in the DAM.\n(5)\tERCOT must initiate the HRUC process at least one hour before the Operating Hour to fine-tune the Resource commitments using updated Load forecasts and updated Outage information. \n(6)\tThe RUC Study Period for DRUC is the next Operating Day.  The RUC Study Period for HRUC is the balance of the current Operating Day plus the next Operating Day if the DRUC for the Operating Day has been solved. \n(7)\tHRUC may decommit Resources only to maintain the reliability of the ERCOT System. \n(8)\tFor each RUC Study Period, the RUC considers capacity requirements for each hour of the RUC Study Period with the objective of minimizing costs based on logic described in Section 5.5.2, Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) Process.\n(9)\tThe calculated Resource commitments arising from each RUC process, and a list of Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less, must be reviewed by ERCOT before issuing Dispatch Instructions to QSEs to commit, extend, or decommit Resources.\n(10)\tThe Security Sequence is a set of prerequisite processes for RUC that describes the key system components and inputs that are required to support the RUC process, the RUC process itself, and the ERCOT review of the Resource commitment recommendations made by the RUC process. \n(11)\tThe RUC process may not be used to buy Ancillary Service unless the Ancillary Service Offers submitted in the DAM are insufficient to meet the requirements of the Ancillary Service Plan.  \n[NPRR1009:  Delete paragraph (11) above upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project and renumber accordingly.]\n(12)\tAfter the use of market processes to the fullest extent practicable without jeopardizing the reliability of the ERCOT System, any ERCOT Dispatch Instructions for additional capacity that order a QSE to commit a specific Generation Resource to be On-Line shall be considered a RUC Dispatch for the purpose of the Settlement of payments and charges related to the committed Generation Resource.  An Operating Condition Notice (OCN), Advisory, Watch, or Emergency Notice requesting the available capacity of any currently available Generation Resources but not naming specific Generation Resources is not considered a RUC Dispatch for purposes of Settlement.\n(13)\tERCOT shall post on the Market Information System (MIS) Certified Area, for each Off-Line Generation Resource that may be selected by an HRUC process, the current time since the Generation Resource last went Off-Line (in hours) and the corresponding start-up times ERCOT is using for each such Off-Line Generation Resource.

ERCOT shall evaluate the need for Resource-specific deployments during Real-Time operations for management of congestion consistent with the Operating Guides.\n(6)\tERCOT shall also post to the MIS Secure Area any contingencies temporarily removed from the standard contingency list by ERCOT immediately after successful execution of the Security Sequence.

The RUC process takes into account Resources already committed in the Current Operating Plans (COPs), Resources already committed in previous RUCs, Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less, and Resource capacity already committed to provide Ancillary Service.  The formulation of the RUC objective function must employ penalty factors on violations of security constraints.  The objective of the RUC process is to minimize costs based on the Resource costs described in paragraphs (5) through (9) below.  For all hours of the RUC Study Period within the RUC process, Quick Start Generation Resources (QSGRs) with a COP Resource Status of OFFQS shall be considered as On-Line with Low Sustained Limit (LSL) at zero MW.  QSGRs with a Resource Status of OFFQS shall only be committed by ERCOT through a RUC instruction in instances when a reliability issue would not otherwise be managed through Dispatch Instructions from Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED).  For On-Line Energy Storage Resources (ESRs), the Hour Beginning Planned State of Charge (SOC) values provided in the COP for a given hour are discounted to ensure sufficient SOC is preserved to meet Ancillary Service Resource Responsibilities, as reflected in the COP.  Any remaining SOC on the ESR will be considered available for energy dispatch by RUC while respecting the Minimum State of Charge (MinSOC) and Maximum State of Charge (MaxSOC) values provided in the COP.\n(2)\tThe RUC process can recommend Resource decommitment.  ERCOT may only decommit a Resource to resolve transmission constraints that are otherwise unresolvable. Qualifying Facilities (QFs) may be decommitted only after all other types of Resources have been assessed for decommitment.  In addition, the HRUC process provides decision support to ERCOT regarding a Resource decommitment requested by a Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE).  \n(3)\tERCOT shall review the RUC-recommended Resource commitments and the list of Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less to assess feasibility and shall make any changes that it considers necessary, in its sole discretion.  During the RUC process, ERCOT may also review and commit, through a RUC instruction, Combined Cycle Generation Resources that are currently planned to be On-Line but are capable of transitioning to a configuration with additional capacity.  ERCOT may deselect Resources recommended in DRUC and in all HRUC processes if in ERCOT\u2019s sole discretion there is enough time to commit those Resources in the future HRUC processes, taking into account the Resources\u2019 start-up times, to meet ERCOT System reliability.  After each RUC run, ERCOT shall post the amount of capacity deselected per hour in the RUC Study Period to the MIS Secure Area.  A Generation Resource shown as On-Line and available for SCED dispatch for an hour in its COP prior to a DRUC or HRUC process execution, according to Section 5.3, ERCOT Security Sequence Responsibilities, will be considered self-committed for that hour.  For purpose of Settlement, snapshot data will be used as specified in paragraph (2) of Section 5.3.  ERCOT shall issue RUC instructions to each QSE specifying its Resources that have been committed as a result of the RUC process.  ERCOT shall, within one day after making any changes to the RUC-recommended commitments, post to the MIS Secure Area any changes that ERCOT made to the RUC-recommended commitments with an explanation of the changes.\n[NPRR1239:  Replace paragraph (3) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(3)\tERCOT shall review the RUC-recommended Resource commitments and the list of Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less to assess feasibility and shall make any changes that it considers necessary, in its sole discretion.

The following shall apply:\n(a)\tIf a Resource receives a RUC Dispatch Instruction that it cannot meet due to a physical limitation described in paragraph (4) above, the QSE representing the Resource shall notify the ERCOT Operator of the inability to fully comply with the instruction and shall comply with the instruction to the best of the Resource\u2019s ability.  If the QSE has provided the ERCOT Operator notice of that limitation at least seven days prior to the Operating Day in which the instruction occurs, the QSE shall be excused from complying with the portion of the RUC Dispatch Instruction that it could not meet due to the identified limitation.  \n(b)\tIf a QSE provides notice pursuant to paragraph (a) above of a physical limitation that will delay the RUC-committed Resource\u2019s ability to reach its LSL in accordance with a RUC Dispatch Instruction, ERCOT shall extend the RUC Dispatch Instruction so that the Resource\u2019s minimum run time is respected. However, if the Resource will not be available in time to address the issue for which it received the RUC instruction, ERCOT may instead cancel the RUC Dispatch Instruction.\n(5)\tA QSE shall be excused from complying with any portion of a RUC Dispatch Instruction that it could not meet due to a physical limitation that was reflected, at the time of the RUC Dispatch Instruction, in the Resource\u2019s COP, startup time, minimum On-Line time, or minimum Off-Line time.\n(6)\tTo determine the projected energy output level of each Resource and to project potential congestion patterns for each hour of the RUC, ERCOT shall calculate proxy Energy Offer Curves based on the Mitigated Offer Caps (MOCs) for the type of Resource as specified in Section 4.4.9.4, Mitigated Offer Cap and Mitigated Offer Floor, for use in the RUC.  Proxy Energy Offer Curves are calculated by multiplying the MOC by a constant selected by ERCOT from time to time that is no more than 0.10% and applying the cost for all Generation Resource output between High Sustained Limit (HSL) and LSL.  The intent of this process is to minimize the effect of the proxy Energy Offer Curves on optimization.\n(7)\tERCOT shall use the RUC process to evaluate the need to commit Resources for which a QSE has submitted Three-Part Supply Offers and other available Off-Line Resources in addition to Resources that are planned to be On-Line during the RUC Study Period.  All of the above commitment information must be as specified in the QSE\u2019s COP.  For available Off-Line Resources with a cold start time of one hour or less that have not been removed from special consideration under paragraph (9) below pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.2, Current Operating Plan (COP) Performance Requirements, the Startup Offers and Minimum-Energy Offer from a Resource\u2019s Three-Part Supply Offer shall not be used in the RUC process. \n(8)\tERCOT shall create Three-Part Supply Offers for all Resources that did not submit a Three-Part Supply Offer, but are specified as available but Off-Line, excluding Resources with a Resource Status of EMR, in a QSE\u2019s COP.  For such Resources, excluding available Off-Line Resources with a cold start time of one hour or less that have not been removed from special consideration under paragraph (9) below pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.2, ERCOT shall use in the RUC process 100% of any approved verifiable Startup Cost and verifiable minimum-energy cost or if verifiable costs have not been approved, the applicable Resource Category Generic Startup Offer Cost and the applicable Resource Category Generic Minimum-Energy Offer Cost as described specified in Section 4.4.9.2.3, Startup Offer and Minimum-Energy Offer Generic Caps, registered with ERCOT.  Also, for Settlement purposes, ERCOT shall use any approved verifiable Startup Costs and verifiable minimum-energy cost for such Resources, or if verifiable costs have not been approved, the applicable Resource Category Generic Startup Offer Cost and Generic Minimum-Energy Offer Cost.\n(9)\tFor all available Off-Line Resources having a cold start time of one hour or less and not removed from special consideration pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.2, ERCOT shall scale any approved verifiable Startup Cost and verifiable minimum-energy cost or if verifiable costs have not been approved, the applicable Resource Category Generic Startup Offer Cost and the applicable Resource Category Generic Minimum-Energy Offer Cost as specified in Section 4.4.9.2.3 for use in the RUC process.  \nThe above parameter is defined as follows:\nParameter\tUnit\tCurrent Value*\n1HRLESSCOSTSCALING\tPercentage\tMaximum value of 100%\n*  The current value for the parameter(s) referenced in this table above will be recommended by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and approved by the ERCOT Board.  ERCOT shall update parameter value(s) on the first day of the month following ERCOT Board approval unless otherwise directed by the ERCOT Board.  ERCOT shall provide a Market Notice prior to implementation of a revised parameter value.\n(10)\tThe RUC process must treat all Resource capacity providing Ancillary Service as unavailable for the RUC Study Period, unless that treatment leads to infeasibility (i.e., that capacity is needed to resolve some local transmission problem that cannot be resolved by any other means).  If an ERCOT Operator decides that the Ancillary Service capacity allocated to that Resource is infeasible based on ERCOT System conditions, then, ERCOT shall inform each affected QSE of the amount of its Resource capacity that does not qualify to provide Ancillary Service, and the projected hours for which this is the case.  In that event, the affected QSE may, under Section 6.4.9.1.2, Replacement of Infeasible Ancillary Service Due to Transmission Constraints, either:\n(a)\tSubstitute capacity from Resources represented by that QSE;\n(b)\tSubstitute capacity from other QSEs using Ancillary Service Trades; or \n(c)\tAsk ERCOT to replace the capacity.   \n(11)\tFactors included in the RUC process are: \n(a)\tERCOT System-wide hourly Load forecast allocated appropriately over Load buses;\n(b)\tTransmission constraints \u2013 Transfer limits on energy flows through the electricity network;\n(i)\tThermal constraints \u2013 protect transmission facilities against thermal overload;\n(ii)\tGeneric constraints \u2013 protect the transmission system against transient instability, dynamic instability or voltage collapse;\n(c)\tPlanned transmission topology;\n(d)\tEnergy sufficiency constraints;\n(e)\tInputs from the COP, as appropriate;\n(f)\tInputs from Resource Parameters, including a list of Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less, as appropriate;\n(g)\tEach Generation Resource\u2019s Minimum-Energy Offer and Startup Offer, from its Three-Part Supply Offer;\n(h)\tAny Generation Resource that is Off-Line and available but does not have a Three-Part Supply Offer;\n(i)\tForced Outage information; and\n(j)\tInputs from the eight-day look ahead planning tool, which may potentially keep a unit On-Line (or start a unit for the next day) so that a unit minimum duration between starts does not limit the availability of the unit (for security reasons).  \n(12)\tThe HRUC process and the DRUC process are as follows:\n(a)\tThe HRUC process uses current Resource Status for the initial condition for the first hour of the RUC Study Period.  All HRUC processes use the projected status of transmission breakers and switches starting with current status and updated for each remaining hour in the study as indicated in the COP for Resources and in the Outage Scheduler for transmission elements. \n(b)\tThe DRUC process uses the Day-Ahead forecast of total ERCOT Load including DC Tie Schedules for each hour of the Operating Day.  The HRUC process uses the current hourly forecast of total ERCOT Load including DC Tie Schedules for each hour in the RUC Study Period.\n(c)\tThe DRUC process uses the Day-Ahead weather forecast for each hour of the Operating Day.  The HRUC process uses the weather forecast information for each hour of the balance of the RUC Study Period.\n(13)\tA QSE that has one or more of its Resources RUC-committed to provide Ancillary Services must increase its Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility by the total amount of RUC-committed Ancillary Service quantities.  The QSE may only use a RUC-committed Resource to meet its Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility during that Resource\u2019s RUC-Committed Interval if the Resource has been committed by the RUC process to provide Ancillary Service, or the Resource is a Combined Cycle Generation Resource that was RUC-committed to transition from one On-Line configuration to a different configuration with additional capacity.  For cases in which the commitment was to provide Ancillary Service, the QSE shall indicate the exact amount and type of Ancillary Service for which it was committed as the Resource\u2019s Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility and Ancillary Services Schedule for the RUC-Committed Intervals for both telemetry and COP information provided to ERCOT.  Upon deployment of the Ancillary Services, the QSE shall adjust its Ancillary Services Schedule to reflect the amounts requested in the deployment.\n(14)\tA QSE with a Resource that is not a Reliability Must-Run (RMR) Unit or has not received an Outage Schedule Adjustment (OSA) that has been committed in a DRUC or HRUC process may opt out of the RUC Settlement (or \u201cbuy back\u201d the commitment) by setting the COP status of the RUC-committed Resource to ONOPTOUT for the first hour of a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours in the Opt Out Snapshot.  All the configurations of the same Combined Cycle Train shall be treated as the same Resource for the purpose of creating the block of RUC-Committed Hours.  A RUC-committed Combined Cycle Generation Resource may opt out of the RUC Settlement by setting the COP status of any Combined Cycle Generation Resource within the same Combined Cycle Train as the RUC-committed Resource to ONOPTOUT for the first hour of a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours in the Opt Out Snapshot.  A Combined Cycle Generation Resource that is RUC-committed from one On-Line configuration in order to transition to a different configuration with additional capacity may opt out of the RUC Settlement following the same rule for RUC-committed Combined Cycle Generation Resources described above.  A QSE that opts out of RUC Settlement forfeits RUC Settlement for the affected Resource for a given block of RUC Buy-Back Hours.  A QSE that opts out of RUC Settlement treatment must make the Resource available to SCED for all RUC Buy-Back Hours.  All hours in a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours that includes the RUC Buy-Back Hour shall be considered RUC Buy-Back Hours.  If a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours spans more than one Operating Day and a QSE wishes to opt out of RUC Settlement for the RUC-Committed Hours in the second or subsequent Operating Day, the QSE must set its COP status to ONOPTOUT for the first hour of the first Operating Day in the Opt Out Snapshot of the first Operating Day.\n(15)\tERCOT shall, as soon as practicable, post to the MIS Secure Area a report identifying those hours that were considered RUC Buy-Back Hours, along with the name of each RUC-committed Resource whose QSE opted out of RUC Settlement.\n[NPRR1239:  Replace paragraph (15) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(15)\tERCOT shall, as soon as practicable, post to the ERCOT website a report identifying those hours that were considered RUC Buy-Back Hours, along with the name of each RUC-committed Resource whose QSE opted out of RUC Settlement.\n(16)\tA Resource that has a Three-Part Supply Offer cleared in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) and subsequently receives a RUC commitment for the Operating Hour for which it was awarded will be treated as if the telemetered Resource Status was ONOPTOUT for purposes of Section 6.5.7.3, Security Constrained Economic Dispatch, and Section 6.5.7.3.1, Determination of Real-Time On-Line Reliability Deployment Price Adder.\n(17)\tA Resource that has self-committed for an Operating Hour after the RUC Snapshot was taken but before the RUC commitment has been communicated through an XML message for that RUC process and that Operating Hour is included in a block of RUC-committed hours for that RUC process will be treated as if the Resource Status was ONOPTOUT for purposes of Section 6.5.7.3, Section 6.5.7.3.1, Operating Reserve Demand Curve (ORDC) calculations, and RUC Settlement for the entire block of RUC-committed hours.  A QSE that has a Resource that meets these conditions must make the Resource available to SCED for the entire block of RUC-committed hours.  ERCOT will send the QSE a notification stating the Operating Day and block of hours for which this occurred.\n[NPRR1009, NPRR1032, NPRR1204, NPRR1239, and NPRR1245:  Replace applicable portions of Section 5.5.2 above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project for NPRR1009, NPRR1204, and NPRR1245; or upon system implementation for NPRR1032 or NPRR1239:]\n5.5.2\tReliability Unit Commitment (RUC) Process\n(1)\tThe RUC process recommends commitment of Generation Resources, to match ERCOT\u2019s forecasted Load including Direct Current Tie (DC Tie) Schedules and RUC Ancillary Service Demand Curves (ASDCs), subject to all transmission constraints and Resource performance characteristics.  The RUC process takes into account Resources already committed in the Current Operating Plans (COPs), Resources already committed in previous RUCs, and Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less.  For On-Line Energy Storage Resources (ESRs), using RUC duration requirements for energy and Ancillary Services, RUC-projected dispatch for energy and Ancillary Service in one interval shall respect the ESR\u2019s minimum and maximum State of Charge (SOC) values from the COP, while incorporating any adjustments under paragraph (19)(d) below.  In addition, using the Ancillary Service Deployment Factors and their respective deployment duration requirements, the SOC required to support these dispatch levels for energy and Ancillary Services will match as closely as possible the difference between the adjusted COP values of the next interval\u2019s Hour Beginning Planned SOC and the current interval\u2019s Hour Beginning Planned SOC.  The formulation of the RUC objective function must employ penalty factors on violations of security constraints and violations of ESR COP Hour Beginning Planned SOC.  The objective of the RUC process is to minimize costs based on the Resource costs described in paragraphs (11) through (15) below.  ESR energy dispatch costs and Ancillary Service Offer costs are not included in the RUC objective function.\n(2)\tERCOT shall create an ASDC for each Ancillary Service for use in RUC.  ERCOT shall post the ASDCs to the ERCOT website as soon as practicable after any change to the ASDCs.\n(3)\tERCOT shall post the following Ancillary Service Deployment Factor data on the ERCOT website:\n(a)\tFollowing each execution of RUC, ERCOT shall post the Ancillary Service Deployment Factors used by that RUC process for each hour in the RUC Study Period;\n(b)\tNo later than 0600 in the Day-Ahead for each Operating Day, ERCOT shall post the Ancillary Service Deployments Factors that are projected to be used in the RUC process for that Operating Day; and\n(c)\tFollowing each month, ERCOT shall post the average, minimum, and maximum Ancillary Service Deployment Factors used in the RUC process by type of Ancillary Service and hour of the day for the month.\n(4)\tFor all hours of the RUC Study Period within the RUC process, Quick Start Generation Resources (QSGRs) with a COP Resource Status of OFFQS shall be considered as On-Line with Low Sustained Limit (LSL) at zero MW.  QSGRs with a Resource Status of OFFQS shall only be committed by ERCOT through a RUC instruction in instances when a reliability issue would not otherwise be managed through Dispatch Instructions from Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED). \n(5)\tIn addition to On-Line qualified Generation Resources and ESRs, the RUC engine shall consider a COP Resource status of OFFQS for QSGRs that are qualified for ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service (ECRS), as being eligible to provide ECRS constrained by the Ancillary Service capability in the COP.\n(6)\tIn addition to On-Line qualified Generation Resources and ESRs, the RUC engine shall consider a COP Resource Status of OFFQS for QSGRs that are qualified for Non-Spinning Reserve (Non-Spin), as being eligible to provide Non-Spin constrained by the Ancillary Service Capability in the COP.  The RUC engine shall also consider a COP Resource Status of OFF (Off-Line but available for commitment in the DAM and RUC) for a Resource that is qualified for Non-Spin, as being eligible to provide Non-Spin constrained by the Ancillary Service capability in the COP.\n(7)\tIn addition to On-Line qualified Generation Resources and ESRs, the RUC engine shall consider a COP Resource Status of ONL for Load Resources that are qualified for Ancillary Services, as being eligible to provide Ancillary Services constrained by the Ancillary Service Capability in the COP.  The RUC engine will not consider any Load Resources for dispatch of energy.\n(8)\tThe RUC process can recommend Resource decommitment.  ERCOT may only decommit a Resource to resolve transmission constraints that are otherwise unresolvable.  Qualifying Facilities (QFs) may be decommitted only after all other types of Resources have been assessed for decommitment.  In addition, the HRUC process provides decision support to ERCOT regarding a Resource decommitment requested by a Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE).  \n(9)\tERCOT shall review the RUC-recommended Resource commitments and the list of Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less to assess feasibility and shall make any changes that it considers necessary, in its sole discretion.  During the RUC process, ERCOT may also review and commit, through a RUC instruction, Combined Cycle Generation Resources that are currently planned to be On-Line but are capable of transitioning to a configuration with additional capacity.  ERCOT may deselect Resources recommended in DRUC and in all HRUC processes if in ERCOT\u2019s sole discretion there is enough time to commit those Resources in the future HRUC processes, taking into account the Resources\u2019 start-up times, to meet ERCOT System reliability.  After each RUC run, ERCOT shall post the amount of capacity deselected per hour in the RUC Study Period to the ERCOT website.  A Generation Resource shown as On-Line and available for SCED dispatch for an hour in its COP prior to a DRUC or HRUC process execution, according to Section 5.3, ERCOT Security Sequence Responsibilities, will be considered self-committed for that hour.  For purpose of Settlement, snapshot data will be used as specified in paragraph (2) of Section 5.3.  \n(10)\tERCOT shall issue RUC instructions to each QSE specifying its Resources that have been committed as a result of the RUC process.  ERCOT shall, within one day after making any changes to the RUC-recommended commitments, post to the ERCOT website any changes that ERCOT made to the RUC-recommended commitments with an explanation of the changes.\n(11)\tERCOT shall use the RUC process to evaluate the need to commit Resources for which a QSE has submitted Three-Part Supply Offers and other available Off-Line Resources in addition to Resources that are planned to be On-Line during the RUC Study Period.  All of the above commitment information must be as specified in the QSE\u2019s COP.  For available Off-Line Resources with a cold start time of one hour or less that have not been removed from special consideration under paragraph (17) below pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.2, Current Operating Plan (COP) Performance Requirements, the Startup Offers and Minimum-Energy Offer from a Resource\u2019s Three-Part Supply Offer shall not be used in the RUC process. \n(12)\tERCOT shall create Three-Part Supply Offers for all Resources that did not submit a Three-Part Supply Offer, but are specified as available but Off-Line, excluding Resources with a Resource Status of EMR, in a QSE\u2019s COP.  For such Resources, excluding available Off-Line Resources with a cold start time of one hour or less that have not been removed from special consideration under paragraph (15) below pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.2, ERCOT shall use in the RUC process 100% of any approved verifiable Startup Cost and verifiable minimum-energy cost or if verifiable costs have not been approved, the applicable Resource Category Generic Startup Offer Cost and the applicable Resource Category Generic Minimum-Energy Offer Cost as described specified in Section 4.4.9.2.3, Startup Offer and Minimum-Energy Offer Generic Caps, registered with ERCOT.  Also, for Settlement purposes, ERCOT shall use any approved verifiable Startup Costs and verifiable minimum-energy cost for such Resources, or if verifiable costs have not been approved, the applicable Resource Category Generic Startup Offer Cost and Generic Minimum-Energy Offer Cost.\n(13)\tA QSE shall notify the ERCOT Operator of any physical limitation that impacts its Resource\u2019s ability to start that is not reflected in the Resource\u2019s COP or the Resource\u2019s startup time, minimum On-Line time, or minimum Off-Line time.  The following shall apply:\n(a)\tIf a Resource receives a RUC Dispatch Instruction that it cannot meet due to a physical limitation described in paragraph (5) above, the QSE representing the Resource shall notify the ERCOT Operator of the inability to fully comply with the instruction and shall comply with the instruction to the best of the Resource\u2019s ability.  If the QSE has provided the ERCOT Operator notice of that limitation at least seven days prior to the Operating Day in which the instruction occurs, the QSE shall be excused from complying with the portion of the RUC Dispatch Instruction that it could not meet due to the identified limitation.  \n(b)\tIf a QSE provides notice pursuant to paragraph (a) above of a physical limitation that will delay the RUC-committed Resource\u2019s ability to reach its LSL in accordance with a RUC Dispatch Instruction, ERCOT shall extend the RUC Dispatch Instruction so that the Resource\u2019s minimum run time is respected. However, if the Resource will not be available in time to address the issue for which it received the RUC instruction, ERCOT may instead cancel the RUC Dispatch Instruction.\n(14)\tA QSE shall be excused from complying with any portion of a RUC Dispatch Instruction that it could not meet due to a physical limitation that was reflected, at the time of the RUC Dispatch Instruction, in the Resource\u2019s COP, startup time, minimum On-Line time, or minimum Off-Line time.\n(15)\tTo determine the projected energy output level of each Resource and to project potential congestion patterns for each hour of the RUC, ERCOT shall calculate proxy Energy Offer Curves based on the Mitigated Offer Caps (MOCs) for the type of Resource as specified in Section 4.4.9.4, Mitigated Offer Cap and Mitigated Offer Floor, for use in the RUC.  Proxy Energy Offer Curves are calculated by multiplying the MOC by a constant selected by ERCOT from time to time that is no more than 0.10% and applying the cost for all Generation Resource output between High Sustained Limit (HSL) and LSL.  The intent of this process is to minimize the effect of the proxy Energy Offer Curves on optimization.  For ESRs, energy dispatch costs are not considered in determining projected energy output levels.\n(16)\tERCOT shall calculate proxy Ancillary Service Offer Curves for use in RUC based on validated Ancillary Service Offers as specified in Section 4.4.7.2, Ancillary Service Offers.  For all Resources that do not have a valid Ancillary Service Offer but are qualified to provide an Ancillary Service, ERCOT shall create an Ancillary Service Offer Curve for use in RUC as described in Section 6.5.7.3, Security Constrained Economic Dispatch.  Proxy Ancillary Service Offer Curves for use in RUC are calculated by multiplying the Ancillary Service Offer by a constant selected by ERCOT from time to time that is no more than 0.1%, and are extended between the HSL and LSL.  Notwithstanding the presence or absence of a proxy Ancillary Service Offer, Ancillary Service provision in RUC shall be limited by the Resource\u2019s Ancillary Service capabilities as reflected in the COP.  For ESRs, Ancillary Service Offer costs are not considered in determining projected Ancillary Service awards.\n(17)\tFor all available Off-Line Resources having a cold start time of one hour or less and not removed from special consideration pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.2, ERCOT shall scale any approved verifiable Startup Cost and verifiable minimum-energy cost or if verifiable costs have not been approved, the applicable Resource Category Generic Startup Offer Cost and the applicable Resource Category Generic Minimum-Energy Offer Cost as specified in Section 4.4.9.2.3 for use in the RUC process.  \nThe above parameter is defined as follows:\nParameter\tUnit\tCurrent Value*\n1HRLESSCOSTSCALING\tPercentage\tMaximum value of 100%\n*  The current value for the parameter(s) referenced in this table above will be recommended by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and approved by the ERCOT Board.  ERCOT shall update parameter value(s) on the first day of the month following ERCOT Board approval unless otherwise directed by the ERCOT Board.  ERCOT shall provide a Market Notice prior to implementation of a revised parameter value.\n(18)\tFactors included in the RUC process are: \n(a)\tERCOT System-wide hourly Load forecast allocated appropriately over Load buses;\n(b)\tERCOT\u2019s Ancillary Service Plans in the form of ASDCs;\n(c)\tTransmission constraints \u2013 Transfer limits on energy flows through the electricity network;\n(i)\tThermal constraints \u2013 protect transmission facilities against thermal overload;\n(ii)\tGeneric constraints \u2013 protect the transmission system against transient instability, dynamic instability or voltage collapse;\n(d)\tPlanned transmission topology;\n(e)\tEnergy sufficiency constraints, including RUC duration requirements for energy and Ancillary Services;\n(f)\tInputs from the COP, as appropriate;\n(g)\tInputs from Resource Parameters, including a list of Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less, as appropriate;\n(h)\tEach Generation Resource\u2019s Minimum-Energy Offer and Startup Offer, from its Three-Part Supply Offer;\n(i)\tAny Generation Resource that is Off-Line and available but does not have a Three-Part Supply Offer;\n(j)\tForced Outage information;\n(k)\tInputs from the eight-day look ahead planning tool, which may potentially keep a unit On-Line (or start a unit for the next day) so that a unit minimum duration between starts does not limit the availability of the unit (for security reasons); and\n(l)\tAncillary Service Deployment Factors. \n(19)\tThe HRUC process and the DRUC process are as follows:\n(a)\tThe HRUC process uses current Resource Status for the initial condition for the first hour of the RUC Study Period.  All HRUC processes use the projected status of transmission breakers and switches starting with current status and updated for each remaining hour in the study as indicated in the COP for Resources and in the Outage Scheduler for transmission elements. \n(b)\tThe DRUC process uses the current hourly forecast of total ERCOT Load including DC Tie Schedules up to the physical rating of the DC Tie for each hour of the Operating Day.  The HRUC process uses the current hourly forecast of total ERCOT Load including DC Tie Schedules up to the physical rating of the DC Tie for each hour in the RUC Study Period.\n(c)\tThe DRUC process uses the Day-Ahead weather forecast for each hour of the Operating Day.  The HRUC process uses the weather forecast information for each hour of the balance of the RUC Study Period.\n(d)\tFor the HRUC, DRUC, and Weekly Reliability Unit Commitment (WRUC) processes, a feasibility check on the COP submitted Hour Beginning Planned SOC will be performed.  This check may adjust the Hour Beginning Planned SOC used in the RUC process.  The feasibility check looks sequentially across all intervals in the RUC Study Period to validate whether a particular interval\u2019s COP Hour Beginning Planned SOC is achievable from the previous interval.  If it is not feasible, then RUC will adjust the Hour Beginning Planned SOC to the closest achievable value.\n(20)\tA QSE with a Resource that is not a Reliability Must-Run (RMR) Unit or has not received an Outage Schedule Adjustment (OSA) that has been committed in a DRUC or HRUC process may opt out of the RUC Settlement (or \u201cbuy back\u201d the commitment) by setting the COP status of the RUC-committed Resource to ONOPTOUT for the first hour of a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours in the Opt Out Snapshot.  All the configurations of the same Combined Cycle Train shall be treated as the same Resource for the purpose of creating the block of RUC-Committed Hours.  A RUC-committed Combined Cycle Generation Resource may opt out of the RUC Settlement by setting the COP status of any Combined Cycle Generation Resource within the same Combined Cycle Train as the RUC-committed Resource to ONOPTOUT for the first hour of a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours in the Opt Out Snapshot.  A Combined Cycle Generation Resource that is RUC-committed from one On-Line configuration in order to transition to a different configuration with additional capacity may opt out of the RUC Settlement following the same rule for RUC-committed Combined Cycle Generation Resources described above.  A QSE that opts out of RUC Settlement forfeits RUC Settlement for the affected Resource for a given block of RUC Buy-Back Hours.  A QSE that opts out of RUC Settlement treatment must make the Resource available to SCED for all RUC Buy-Back Hours.  All hours in a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours that includes the RUC Buy-Back Hour shall be considered RUC Buy-Back Hours.  If a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours spans more than one Operating Day and a QSE wishes to opt out of RUC Settlement for the RUC-Committed Hours in the second or subsequent Operating Day, the QSE must set its COP status to ONOPTOUT for the first hour of that the first Operating Day in the Opt Out Snapshot of the first Operating Day.\n(21)\tERCOT shall, as soon as practicable, post to the ERCOT website a report identifying those hours that were considered RUC Buy-Back Hours, along with the name of each RUC-committed Resource whose QSE opted out of RUC Settlement.\n(22)\tA Resource that has a Three-Part Supply Offer cleared in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) and subsequently receives a RUC commitment for the Operating Hour for which it was awarded will be treated as if the Resource Status was ONOPTOUT for purposes of Section 6.5.7.3 and Section 6.5.7.3.1, Determination of Real-Time Reliability Deployment Price Adders.\n(23)\tA Resource that has self-committed for an Operating Hour after the RUC Snapshot was taken but before the RUC commitment has been communicated through an XML message for that RUC process and that Operating Hour is included in a block of RUC-committed hours for that RUC process will be treated as if the Resource Status was ONOPTOUT for purposes of Section 6.5.7.3, Section 6.5.7.3.1, and RUC Settlement for the entire block of RUC-committed hours.  A QSE that has a Resource that meets these conditions must make the Resource available to SCED for the entire block of RUC-committed hours.  ERCOT will send the QSE a notification stating the Operating Day and block of hours for which this occurred.\n5.5.3\tCommunication of RUC Commitments and Decommitments\n(1)\tThe output of the RUC process is the cleared Resource commitments and decommitments, and a list of the Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less.\n(2)\tERCOT shall notify each QSE in the Day-Ahead of the DRUC Resource commitments and advisory decommitments that have been cleared by the RUC for the Resources that QSE represents.  ERCOT shall notify each QSE of the HRUC Resource commitments and decommitments that have been cleared by the RUC for the Resources that QSE represents.  Resource commitments must include the start interval and duration for which the Resource is required to be at least at LSL.  Resource decommitments must include the interval in which the Resource is required to be Off-Line, duration, and reason for the decommitment.  ERCOT shall notify each QSE representing an RMR Unit if that unit has been cleared by the DRUC or HRUC process at the same time that the DRUC and HRUC participants are notified of the results of each such process.  \n(3)\tIf ERCOT communicates HRUC commitments and decommitments verbally to a QSE, then the same Resource attributes communicated programmatically must be communicated when ERCOT gives a verbal Resource commitment or decommitment.\n(4)\tThe QSE shall acknowledge the notice or commitment or decommitment by changing the Resource Status of the affected Resources in the COP for RUC-Committed Intervals.\n5.6\tRUC Cost Eligibility\n5.6.1\tVerifiable Costs\n(1)\tThe Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) is responsible for submitting verifiable costs unless both the QSE and Resource Entity agree that the Resource Entity will have this responsibility, in which case both the QSE and Resource Entity shall submit an affidavit to ERCOT stating this arrangement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, QSEs that submit Power Purchase or Tolling Agreements (PPAs) do not have the option of allowing Resource Entities to file verifiable costs.\n(2)\tMake-Whole Payments for a Resource are based on the Startup Offers and Minimum-Energy Offers for the Resource, limited by caps.  Until ERCOT approves verifiable unit-specific costs for that Resource, the caps are the Resource Category Startup Generic Cap and the Resource Category Minimum-Energy Generic Cap.  When ERCOT approves verifiable unit-specific costs for that Resource the caps are those verifiable unit-specific costs.  A QSE or Resource Entity may file verifiable unit-specific costs for a Resource at any time, but it must file those costs no later than 30 days after five Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) events for that Resource in a calendar year.  A RUC event begins when a Resource receives a RUC instruction to come or stay On-Line and ends the later of when the Resource shuts down or the end of the Operating Day.  The most recent ERCOT-approved verifiable costs must be used going forward. \n(3)\tThese unit-specific verifiable costs may include and are limited to the following average incremental costs:\n(a)\tAllocation of maintenance requirements based on number of starts between maintenance events using, at the option of the QSE or Resource Entity, either:\n(i)\tManufacturer-recommended maintenance schedule; \n(ii)\tHistorical data for the unit and actual maintenance practices; or\n(iii)\tAnother method approved in advance by ERCOT in writing;\n(b)\tStartup fuel calculations based on recorded actual measured flows when the data is available or based on averages of historical flows for similar starts (for example, hot, cold, intermediate) when actual data is not available.  Startup fuel will include filing separately the startup fuel required to reach breaker close and fuel after breaker close to Low Sustained Limit (LSL).

For gas-fired units, the actual fuel costs must be calculated using the actual Seasonal heat rate (which must be supplied to ERCOT with Seasonal heat-rate test data) multiplied by the fuel price plus consideration of a fuel adder that compensates for the transportation and purchasing of spot fuel as described in the Verifiable Cost Manual.  For coal- and lignite-fired units, the actual fuel costs must be calculated using the actual Seasonal heat rate multiplied by a deemed fuel price of $1.50 per MMBtu.  For fuel oil-fired operations, the number of gallons burned must be multiplied by the FOP.\n5.6.2\tRUC Startup Cost Eligibility\n(1)\tFor purposes of this Section 5.6.2, all contiguous RUC-Committed Hours are considered as one RUC instruction.

ERCOT, in its sole discretion, may conduct a RUC at any time to evaluate and resolve reliability issues.\n(3)\tThe DRUC must be run after the close of the Day-Ahead Market (DAM). \n(4)\tThe DRUC uses Three-Part Supply Offers, capped at the maximum of generic or verifiable minimum energy and Startup Costs, submitted before the DAM by Qualified Scheduling Entities (QSEs) that were considered in the DAM but not awarded in the DAM.  A QSE may not submit a Three-Part Supply Offer to be considered in the DRUC unless the offer was also submitted for consideration in the DAM.\n(5)\tERCOT must initiate the HRUC process at least one hour before the Operating Hour to fine-tune the Resource commitments using updated Load forecasts and updated Outage information. \n(6)\tThe RUC Study Period for DRUC is the next Operating Day.  The RUC Study Period for HRUC is the balance of the current Operating Day plus the next Operating Day if the DRUC for the Operating Day has been solved. \n(7)\tHRUC may decommit Resources only to maintain the reliability of the ERCOT System. \n(8)\tFor each RUC Study Period, the RUC considers capacity requirements for each hour of the RUC Study Period with the objective of minimizing costs based on logic described in Section 5.5.2, Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) Process.\n(9)\tThe calculated Resource commitments arising from each RUC process, and a list of Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less, must be reviewed by ERCOT before issuing Dispatch Instructions to QSEs to commit, extend, or decommit Resources.\n(10)\tThe Security Sequence is a set of prerequisite processes for RUC that describes the key system components and inputs that are required to support the RUC process, the RUC process itself, and the ERCOT review of the Resource commitment recommendations made by the RUC process. \n(11)\tThe RUC process may not be used to buy Ancillary Service unless the Ancillary Service Offers submitted in the DAM are insufficient to meet the requirements of the Ancillary Service Plan.  \n[NPRR1009:  Delete paragraph (11) above upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project and renumber accordingly.]\n(12)\tAfter the use of market processes to the fullest extent practicable without jeopardizing the reliability of the ERCOT System, any ERCOT Dispatch Instructions for additional capacity that order a QSE to commit a specific Generation Resource to be On-Line shall be considered a RUC Dispatch for the purpose of the Settlement of payments and charges related to the committed Generation Resource.  An Operating Condition Notice (OCN), Advisory, Watch, or Emergency Notice requesting the available capacity of any currently available Generation Resources but not naming specific Generation Resources is not considered a RUC Dispatch for purposes of Settlement.\n(13)\tERCOT shall post on the Market Information System (MIS) Certified Area, for each Off-Line Generation Resource that may be selected by an HRUC process, the current time since the Generation Resource last went Off-Line (in hours) and the corresponding start-up times ERCOT is using for each such Off-Line Generation Resource.

The RUC process takes into account Resources already committed in the Current Operating Plans (COPs), Resources already committed in previous RUCs, Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less, and Resource capacity already committed to provide Ancillary Service.  The formulation of the RUC objective function must employ penalty factors on violations of security constraints.  The objective of the RUC process is to minimize costs based on the Resource costs described in paragraphs (5) through (9) below.  For all hours of the RUC Study Period within the RUC process, Quick Start Generation Resources (QSGRs) with a COP Resource Status of OFFQS shall be considered as On-Line with Low Sustained Limit (LSL) at zero MW.  QSGRs with a Resource Status of OFFQS shall only be committed by ERCOT through a RUC instruction in instances when a reliability issue would not otherwise be managed through Dispatch Instructions from Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED).  For On-Line Energy Storage Resources (ESRs), the Hour Beginning Planned State of Charge (SOC) values provided in the COP for a given hour are discounted to ensure sufficient SOC is preserved to meet Ancillary Service Resource Responsibilities, as reflected in the COP.  Any remaining SOC on the ESR will be considered available for energy dispatch by RUC while respecting the Minimum State of Charge (MinSOC) and Maximum State of Charge (MaxSOC) values provided in the COP.\n(2)\tThe RUC process can recommend Resource decommitment.  ERCOT may only decommit a Resource to resolve transmission constraints that are otherwise unresolvable. Qualifying Facilities (QFs) may be decommitted only after all other types of Resources have been assessed for decommitment.  In addition, the HRUC process provides decision support to ERCOT regarding a Resource decommitment requested by a Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE).  \n(3)\tERCOT shall review the RUC-recommended Resource commitments and the list of Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less to assess feasibility and shall make any changes that it considers necessary, in its sole discretion.  During the RUC process, ERCOT may also review and commit, through a RUC instruction, Combined Cycle Generation Resources that are currently planned to be On-Line but are capable of transitioning to a configuration with additional capacity.  ERCOT may deselect Resources recommended in DRUC and in all HRUC processes if in ERCOT\u2019s sole discretion there is enough time to commit those Resources in the future HRUC processes, taking into account the Resources\u2019 start-up times, to meet ERCOT System reliability.  After each RUC run, ERCOT shall post the amount of capacity deselected per hour in the RUC Study Period to the MIS Secure Area.  A Generation Resource shown as On-Line and available for SCED dispatch for an hour in its COP prior to a DRUC or HRUC process execution, according to Section 5.3, ERCOT Security Sequence Responsibilities, will be considered self-committed for that hour.  For purpose of Settlement, snapshot data will be used as specified in paragraph (2) of Section 5.3.  ERCOT shall issue RUC instructions to each QSE specifying its Resources that have been committed as a result of the RUC process.  ERCOT shall, within one day after making any changes to the RUC-recommended commitments, post to the MIS Secure Area any changes that ERCOT made to the RUC-recommended commitments with an explanation of the changes.\n[NPRR1239:  Replace paragraph (3) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(3)\tERCOT shall review the RUC-recommended Resource commitments and the list of Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less to assess feasibility and shall make any changes that it considers necessary, in its sole discretion.

The following shall apply:\n(a)\tIf a Resource receives a RUC Dispatch Instruction that it cannot meet due to a physical limitation described in paragraph (4) above, the QSE representing the Resource shall notify the ERCOT Operator of the inability to fully comply with the instruction and shall comply with the instruction to the best of the Resource\u2019s ability.  If the QSE has provided the ERCOT Operator notice of that limitation at least seven days prior to the Operating Day in which the instruction occurs, the QSE shall be excused from complying with the portion of the RUC Dispatch Instruction that it could not meet due to the identified limitation.  \n(b)\tIf a QSE provides notice pursuant to paragraph (a) above of a physical limitation that will delay the RUC-committed Resource\u2019s ability to reach its LSL in accordance with a RUC Dispatch Instruction, ERCOT shall extend the RUC Dispatch Instruction so that the Resource\u2019s minimum run time is respected. However, if the Resource will not be available in time to address the issue for which it received the RUC instruction, ERCOT may instead cancel the RUC Dispatch Instruction.\n(5)\tA QSE shall be excused from complying with any portion of a RUC Dispatch Instruction that it could not meet due to a physical limitation that was reflected, at the time of the RUC Dispatch Instruction, in the Resource\u2019s COP, startup time, minimum On-Line time, or minimum Off-Line time.\n(6)\tTo determine the projected energy output level of each Resource and to project potential congestion patterns for each hour of the RUC, ERCOT shall calculate proxy Energy Offer Curves based on the Mitigated Offer Caps (MOCs) for the type of Resource as specified in Section 4.4.9.4, Mitigated Offer Cap and Mitigated Offer Floor, for use in the RUC.  Proxy Energy Offer Curves are calculated by multiplying the MOC by a constant selected by ERCOT from time to time that is no more than 0.10% and applying the cost for all Generation Resource output between High Sustained Limit (HSL) and LSL.  The intent of this process is to minimize the effect of the proxy Energy Offer Curves on optimization.\n(7)\tERCOT shall use the RUC process to evaluate the need to commit Resources for which a QSE has submitted Three-Part Supply Offers and other available Off-Line Resources in addition to Resources that are planned to be On-Line during the RUC Study Period.  All of the above commitment information must be as specified in the QSE\u2019s COP.  For available Off-Line Resources with a cold start time of one hour or less that have not been removed from special consideration under paragraph (9) below pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.2, Current Operating Plan (COP) Performance Requirements, the Startup Offers and Minimum-Energy Offer from a Resource\u2019s Three-Part Supply Offer shall not be used in the RUC process. \n(8)\tERCOT shall create Three-Part Supply Offers for all Resources that did not submit a Three-Part Supply Offer, but are specified as available but Off-Line, excluding Resources with a Resource Status of EMR, in a QSE\u2019s COP.  For such Resources, excluding available Off-Line Resources with a cold start time of one hour or less that have not been removed from special consideration under paragraph (9) below pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.2, ERCOT shall use in the RUC process 100% of any approved verifiable Startup Cost and verifiable minimum-energy cost or if verifiable costs have not been approved, the applicable Resource Category Generic Startup Offer Cost and the applicable Resource Category Generic Minimum-Energy Offer Cost as described specified in Section 4.4.9.2.3, Startup Offer and Minimum-Energy Offer Generic Caps, registered with ERCOT.  Also, for Settlement purposes, ERCOT shall use any approved verifiable Startup Costs and verifiable minimum-energy cost for such Resources, or if verifiable costs have not been approved, the applicable Resource Category Generic Startup Offer Cost and Generic Minimum-Energy Offer Cost.\n(9)\tFor all available Off-Line Resources having a cold start time of one hour or less and not removed from special consideration pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.2, ERCOT shall scale any approved verifiable Startup Cost and verifiable minimum-energy cost or if verifiable costs have not been approved, the applicable Resource Category Generic Startup Offer Cost and the applicable Resource Category Generic Minimum-Energy Offer Cost as specified in Section 4.4.9.2.3 for use in the RUC process.  \nThe above parameter is defined as follows:\nParameter\tUnit\tCurrent Value*\n1HRLESSCOSTSCALING\tPercentage\tMaximum value of 100%\n*  The current value for the parameter(s) referenced in this table above will be recommended by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and approved by the ERCOT Board.  ERCOT shall update parameter value(s) on the first day of the month following ERCOT Board approval unless otherwise directed by the ERCOT Board.  ERCOT shall provide a Market Notice prior to implementation of a revised parameter value.\n(10)\tThe RUC process must treat all Resource capacity providing Ancillary Service as unavailable for the RUC Study Period, unless that treatment leads to infeasibility (i.e., that capacity is needed to resolve some local transmission problem that cannot be resolved by any other means).  If an ERCOT Operator decides that the Ancillary Service capacity allocated to that Resource is infeasible based on ERCOT System conditions, then, ERCOT shall inform each affected QSE of the amount of its Resource capacity that does not qualify to provide Ancillary Service, and the projected hours for which this is the case.  In that event, the affected QSE may, under Section 6.4.9.1.2, Replacement of Infeasible Ancillary Service Due to Transmission Constraints, either:\n(a)\tSubstitute capacity from Resources represented by that QSE;\n(b)\tSubstitute capacity from other QSEs using Ancillary Service Trades; or \n(c)\tAsk ERCOT to replace the capacity.   \n(11)\tFactors included in the RUC process are: \n(a)\tERCOT System-wide hourly Load forecast allocated appropriately over Load buses;\n(b)\tTransmission constraints \u2013 Transfer limits on energy flows through the electricity network;\n(i)\tThermal constraints \u2013 protect transmission facilities against thermal overload;\n(ii)\tGeneric constraints \u2013 protect the transmission system against transient instability, dynamic instability or voltage collapse;\n(c)\tPlanned transmission topology;\n(d)\tEnergy sufficiency constraints;\n(e)\tInputs from the COP, as appropriate;\n(f)\tInputs from Resource Parameters, including a list of Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less, as appropriate;\n(g)\tEach Generation Resource\u2019s Minimum-Energy Offer and Startup Offer, from its Three-Part Supply Offer;\n(h)\tAny Generation Resource that is Off-Line and available but does not have a Three-Part Supply Offer;\n(i)\tForced Outage information; and\n(j)\tInputs from the eight-day look ahead planning tool, which may potentially keep a unit On-Line (or start a unit for the next day) so that a unit minimum duration between starts does not limit the availability of the unit (for security reasons).  \n(12)\tThe HRUC process and the DRUC process are as follows:\n(a)\tThe HRUC process uses current Resource Status for the initial condition for the first hour of the RUC Study Period.  All HRUC processes use the projected status of transmission breakers and switches starting with current status and updated for each remaining hour in the study as indicated in the COP for Resources and in the Outage Scheduler for transmission elements. \n(b)\tThe DRUC process uses the Day-Ahead forecast of total ERCOT Load including DC Tie Schedules for each hour of the Operating Day.  The HRUC process uses the current hourly forecast of total ERCOT Load including DC Tie Schedules for each hour in the RUC Study Period.\n(c)\tThe DRUC process uses the Day-Ahead weather forecast for each hour of the Operating Day.  The HRUC process uses the weather forecast information for each hour of the balance of the RUC Study Period.\n(13)\tA QSE that has one or more of its Resources RUC-committed to provide Ancillary Services must increase its Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility by the total amount of RUC-committed Ancillary Service quantities.  The QSE may only use a RUC-committed Resource to meet its Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility during that Resource\u2019s RUC-Committed Interval if the Resource has been committed by the RUC process to provide Ancillary Service, or the Resource is a Combined Cycle Generation Resource that was RUC-committed to transition from one On-Line configuration to a different configuration with additional capacity.  For cases in which the commitment was to provide Ancillary Service, the QSE shall indicate the exact amount and type of Ancillary Service for which it was committed as the Resource\u2019s Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility and Ancillary Services Schedule for the RUC-Committed Intervals for both telemetry and COP information provided to ERCOT.  Upon deployment of the Ancillary Services, the QSE shall adjust its Ancillary Services Schedule to reflect the amounts requested in the deployment.\n(14)\tA QSE with a Resource that is not a Reliability Must-Run (RMR) Unit or has not received an Outage Schedule Adjustment (OSA) that has been committed in a DRUC or HRUC process may opt out of the RUC Settlement (or \u201cbuy back\u201d the commitment) by setting the COP status of the RUC-committed Resource to ONOPTOUT for the first hour of a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours in the Opt Out Snapshot.  All the configurations of the same Combined Cycle Train shall be treated as the same Resource for the purpose of creating the block of RUC-Committed Hours.  A RUC-committed Combined Cycle Generation Resource may opt out of the RUC Settlement by setting the COP status of any Combined Cycle Generation Resource within the same Combined Cycle Train as the RUC-committed Resource to ONOPTOUT for the first hour of a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours in the Opt Out Snapshot.  A Combined Cycle Generation Resource that is RUC-committed from one On-Line configuration in order to transition to a different configuration with additional capacity may opt out of the RUC Settlement following the same rule for RUC-committed Combined Cycle Generation Resources described above.  A QSE that opts out of RUC Settlement forfeits RUC Settlement for the affected Resource for a given block of RUC Buy-Back Hours.  A QSE that opts out of RUC Settlement treatment must make the Resource available to SCED for all RUC Buy-Back Hours.  All hours in a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours that includes the RUC Buy-Back Hour shall be considered RUC Buy-Back Hours.  If a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours spans more than one Operating Day and a QSE wishes to opt out of RUC Settlement for the RUC-Committed Hours in the second or subsequent Operating Day, the QSE must set its COP status to ONOPTOUT for the first hour of the first Operating Day in the Opt Out Snapshot of the first Operating Day.\n(15)\tERCOT shall, as soon as practicable, post to the MIS Secure Area a report identifying those hours that were considered RUC Buy-Back Hours, along with the name of each RUC-committed Resource whose QSE opted out of RUC Settlement.\n[NPRR1239:  Replace paragraph (15) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(15)\tERCOT shall, as soon as practicable, post to the ERCOT website a report identifying those hours that were considered RUC Buy-Back Hours, along with the name of each RUC-committed Resource whose QSE opted out of RUC Settlement.\n(16)\tA Resource that has a Three-Part Supply Offer cleared in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) and subsequently receives a RUC commitment for the Operating Hour for which it was awarded will be treated as if the telemetered Resource Status was ONOPTOUT for purposes of Section 6.5.7.3, Security Constrained Economic Dispatch, and Section 6.5.7.3.1, Determination of Real-Time On-Line Reliability Deployment Price Adder.\n(17)\tA Resource that has self-committed for an Operating Hour after the RUC Snapshot was taken but before the RUC commitment has been communicated through an XML message for that RUC process and that Operating Hour is included in a block of RUC-committed hours for that RUC process will be treated as if the Resource Status was ONOPTOUT for purposes of Section 6.5.7.3, Section 6.5.7.3.1, Operating Reserve Demand Curve (ORDC) calculations, and RUC Settlement for the entire block of RUC-committed hours.  A QSE that has a Resource that meets these conditions must make the Resource available to SCED for the entire block of RUC-committed hours.  ERCOT will send the QSE a notification stating the Operating Day and block of hours for which this occurred.\n[NPRR1009, NPRR1032, NPRR1204, NPRR1239, and NPRR1245:  Replace applicable portions of Section 5.5.2 above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project for NPRR1009, NPRR1204, and NPRR1245; or upon system implementation for NPRR1032 or NPRR1239:]\n5.5.2\tReliability Unit Commitment (RUC) Process\n(1)\tThe RUC process recommends commitment of Generation Resources, to match ERCOT\u2019s forecasted Load including Direct Current Tie (DC Tie) Schedules and RUC Ancillary Service Demand Curves (ASDCs), subject to all transmission constraints and Resource performance characteristics.  The RUC process takes into account Resources already committed in the Current Operating Plans (COPs), Resources already committed in previous RUCs, and Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less.  For On-Line Energy Storage Resources (ESRs), using RUC duration requirements for energy and Ancillary Services, RUC-projected dispatch for energy and Ancillary Service in one interval shall respect the ESR\u2019s minimum and maximum State of Charge (SOC) values from the COP, while incorporating any adjustments under paragraph (19)(d) below.  In addition, using the Ancillary Service Deployment Factors and their respective deployment duration requirements, the SOC required to support these dispatch levels for energy and Ancillary Services will match as closely as possible the difference between the adjusted COP values of the next interval\u2019s Hour Beginning Planned SOC and the current interval\u2019s Hour Beginning Planned SOC.  The formulation of the RUC objective function must employ penalty factors on violations of security constraints and violations of ESR COP Hour Beginning Planned SOC.  The objective of the RUC process is to minimize costs based on the Resource costs described in paragraphs (11) through (15) below.  ESR energy dispatch costs and Ancillary Service Offer costs are not included in the RUC objective function.\n(2)\tERCOT shall create an ASDC for each Ancillary Service for use in RUC.  ERCOT shall post the ASDCs to the ERCOT website as soon as practicable after any change to the ASDCs.\n(3)\tERCOT shall post the following Ancillary Service Deployment Factor data on the ERCOT website:\n(a)\tFollowing each execution of RUC, ERCOT shall post the Ancillary Service Deployment Factors used by that RUC process for each hour in the RUC Study Period;\n(b)\tNo later than 0600 in the Day-Ahead for each Operating Day, ERCOT shall post the Ancillary Service Deployments Factors that are projected to be used in the RUC process for that Operating Day; and\n(c)\tFollowing each month, ERCOT shall post the average, minimum, and maximum Ancillary Service Deployment Factors used in the RUC process by type of Ancillary Service and hour of the day for the month.\n(4)\tFor all hours of the RUC Study Period within the RUC process, Quick Start Generation Resources (QSGRs) with a COP Resource Status of OFFQS shall be considered as On-Line with Low Sustained Limit (LSL) at zero MW.  QSGRs with a Resource Status of OFFQS shall only be committed by ERCOT through a RUC instruction in instances when a reliability issue would not otherwise be managed through Dispatch Instructions from Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED). \n(5)\tIn addition to On-Line qualified Generation Resources and ESRs, the RUC engine shall consider a COP Resource status of OFFQS for QSGRs that are qualified for ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service (ECRS), as being eligible to provide ECRS constrained by the Ancillary Service capability in the COP.\n(6)\tIn addition to On-Line qualified Generation Resources and ESRs, the RUC engine shall consider a COP Resource Status of OFFQS for QSGRs that are qualified for Non-Spinning Reserve (Non-Spin), as being eligible to provide Non-Spin constrained by the Ancillary Service Capability in the COP.  The RUC engine shall also consider a COP Resource Status of OFF (Off-Line but available for commitment in the DAM and RUC) for a Resource that is qualified for Non-Spin, as being eligible to provide Non-Spin constrained by the Ancillary Service capability in the COP.\n(7)\tIn addition to On-Line qualified Generation Resources and ESRs, the RUC engine shall consider a COP Resource Status of ONL for Load Resources that are qualified for Ancillary Services, as being eligible to provide Ancillary Services constrained by the Ancillary Service Capability in the COP.  The RUC engine will not consider any Load Resources for dispatch of energy.\n(8)\tThe RUC process can recommend Resource decommitment.  ERCOT may only decommit a Resource to resolve transmission constraints that are otherwise unresolvable.  Qualifying Facilities (QFs) may be decommitted only after all other types of Resources have been assessed for decommitment.  In addition, the HRUC process provides decision support to ERCOT regarding a Resource decommitment requested by a Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE).  \n(9)\tERCOT shall review the RUC-recommended Resource commitments and the list of Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less to assess feasibility and shall make any changes that it considers necessary, in its sole discretion.  During the RUC process, ERCOT may also review and commit, through a RUC instruction, Combined Cycle Generation Resources that are currently planned to be On-Line but are capable of transitioning to a configuration with additional capacity.  ERCOT may deselect Resources recommended in DRUC and in all HRUC processes if in ERCOT\u2019s sole discretion there is enough time to commit those Resources in the future HRUC processes, taking into account the Resources\u2019 start-up times, to meet ERCOT System reliability.  After each RUC run, ERCOT shall post the amount of capacity deselected per hour in the RUC Study Period to the ERCOT website.  A Generation Resource shown as On-Line and available for SCED dispatch for an hour in its COP prior to a DRUC or HRUC process execution, according to Section 5.3, ERCOT Security Sequence Responsibilities, will be considered self-committed for that hour.  For purpose of Settlement, snapshot data will be used as specified in paragraph (2) of Section 5.3.  \n(10)\tERCOT shall issue RUC instructions to each QSE specifying its Resources that have been committed as a result of the RUC process.  ERCOT shall, within one day after making any changes to the RUC-recommended commitments, post to the ERCOT website any changes that ERCOT made to the RUC-recommended commitments with an explanation of the changes.\n(11)\tERCOT shall use the RUC process to evaluate the need to commit Resources for which a QSE has submitted Three-Part Supply Offers and other available Off-Line Resources in addition to Resources that are planned to be On-Line during the RUC Study Period.  All of the above commitment information must be as specified in the QSE\u2019s COP.  For available Off-Line Resources with a cold start time of one hour or less that have not been removed from special consideration under paragraph (17) below pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.2, Current Operating Plan (COP) Performance Requirements, the Startup Offers and Minimum-Energy Offer from a Resource\u2019s Three-Part Supply Offer shall not be used in the RUC process. \n(12)\tERCOT shall create Three-Part Supply Offers for all Resources that did not submit a Three-Part Supply Offer, but are specified as available but Off-Line, excluding Resources with a Resource Status of EMR, in a QSE\u2019s COP.  For such Resources, excluding available Off-Line Resources with a cold start time of one hour or less that have not been removed from special consideration under paragraph (15) below pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.2, ERCOT shall use in the RUC process 100% of any approved verifiable Startup Cost and verifiable minimum-energy cost or if verifiable costs have not been approved, the applicable Resource Category Generic Startup Offer Cost and the applicable Resource Category Generic Minimum-Energy Offer Cost as described specified in Section 4.4.9.2.3, Startup Offer and Minimum-Energy Offer Generic Caps, registered with ERCOT.  Also, for Settlement purposes, ERCOT shall use any approved verifiable Startup Costs and verifiable minimum-energy cost for such Resources, or if verifiable costs have not been approved, the applicable Resource Category Generic Startup Offer Cost and Generic Minimum-Energy Offer Cost.\n(13)\tA QSE shall notify the ERCOT Operator of any physical limitation that impacts its Resource\u2019s ability to start that is not reflected in the Resource\u2019s COP or the Resource\u2019s startup time, minimum On-Line time, or minimum Off-Line time.  The following shall apply:\n(a)\tIf a Resource receives a RUC Dispatch Instruction that it cannot meet due to a physical limitation described in paragraph (5) above, the QSE representing the Resource shall notify the ERCOT Operator of the inability to fully comply with the instruction and shall comply with the instruction to the best of the Resource\u2019s ability.  If the QSE has provided the ERCOT Operator notice of that limitation at least seven days prior to the Operating Day in which the instruction occurs, the QSE shall be excused from complying with the portion of the RUC Dispatch Instruction that it could not meet due to the identified limitation.  \n(b)\tIf a QSE provides notice pursuant to paragraph (a) above of a physical limitation that will delay the RUC-committed Resource\u2019s ability to reach its LSL in accordance with a RUC Dispatch Instruction, ERCOT shall extend the RUC Dispatch Instruction so that the Resource\u2019s minimum run time is respected. However, if the Resource will not be available in time to address the issue for which it received the RUC instruction, ERCOT may instead cancel the RUC Dispatch Instruction.\n(14)\tA QSE shall be excused from complying with any portion of a RUC Dispatch Instruction that it could not meet due to a physical limitation that was reflected, at the time of the RUC Dispatch Instruction, in the Resource\u2019s COP, startup time, minimum On-Line time, or minimum Off-Line time.\n(15)\tTo determine the projected energy output level of each Resource and to project potential congestion patterns for each hour of the RUC, ERCOT shall calculate proxy Energy Offer Curves based on the Mitigated Offer Caps (MOCs) for the type of Resource as specified in Section 4.4.9.4, Mitigated Offer Cap and Mitigated Offer Floor, for use in the RUC.  Proxy Energy Offer Curves are calculated by multiplying the MOC by a constant selected by ERCOT from time to time that is no more than 0.10% and applying the cost for all Generation Resource output between High Sustained Limit (HSL) and LSL.  The intent of this process is to minimize the effect of the proxy Energy Offer Curves on optimization.  For ESRs, energy dispatch costs are not considered in determining projected energy output levels.\n(16)\tERCOT shall calculate proxy Ancillary Service Offer Curves for use in RUC based on validated Ancillary Service Offers as specified in Section 4.4.7.2, Ancillary Service Offers.  For all Resources that do not have a valid Ancillary Service Offer but are qualified to provide an Ancillary Service, ERCOT shall create an Ancillary Service Offer Curve for use in RUC as described in Section 6.5.7.3, Security Constrained Economic Dispatch.  Proxy Ancillary Service Offer Curves for use in RUC are calculated by multiplying the Ancillary Service Offer by a constant selected by ERCOT from time to time that is no more than 0.1%, and are extended between the HSL and LSL.  Notwithstanding the presence or absence of a proxy Ancillary Service Offer, Ancillary Service provision in RUC shall be limited by the Resource\u2019s Ancillary Service capabilities as reflected in the COP.  For ESRs, Ancillary Service Offer costs are not considered in determining projected Ancillary Service awards.\n(17)\tFor all available Off-Line Resources having a cold start time of one hour or less and not removed from special consideration pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.2, ERCOT shall scale any approved verifiable Startup Cost and verifiable minimum-energy cost or if verifiable costs have not been approved, the applicable Resource Category Generic Startup Offer Cost and the applicable Resource Category Generic Minimum-Energy Offer Cost as specified in Section 4.4.9.2.3 for use in the RUC process.  \nThe above parameter is defined as follows:\nParameter\tUnit\tCurrent Value*\n1HRLESSCOSTSCALING\tPercentage\tMaximum value of 100%\n*  The current value for the parameter(s) referenced in this table above will be recommended by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and approved by the ERCOT Board.  ERCOT shall update parameter value(s) on the first day of the month following ERCOT Board approval unless otherwise directed by the ERCOT Board.  ERCOT shall provide a Market Notice prior to implementation of a revised parameter value.\n(18)\tFactors included in the RUC process are: \n(a)\tERCOT System-wide hourly Load forecast allocated appropriately over Load buses;\n(b)\tERCOT\u2019s Ancillary Service Plans in the form of ASDCs;\n(c)\tTransmission constraints \u2013 Transfer limits on energy flows through the electricity network;\n(i)\tThermal constraints \u2013 protect transmission facilities against thermal overload;\n(ii)\tGeneric constraints \u2013 protect the transmission system against transient instability, dynamic instability or voltage collapse;\n(d)\tPlanned transmission topology;\n(e)\tEnergy sufficiency constraints, including RUC duration requirements for energy and Ancillary Services;\n(f)\tInputs from the COP, as appropriate;\n(g)\tInputs from Resource Parameters, including a list of Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less, as appropriate;\n(h)\tEach Generation Resource\u2019s Minimum-Energy Offer and Startup Offer, from its Three-Part Supply Offer;\n(i)\tAny Generation Resource that is Off-Line and available but does not have a Three-Part Supply Offer;\n(j)\tForced Outage information;\n(k)\tInputs from the eight-day look ahead planning tool, which may potentially keep a unit On-Line (or start a unit for the next day) so that a unit minimum duration between starts does not limit the availability of the unit (for security reasons); and\n(l)\tAncillary Service Deployment Factors. \n(19)\tThe HRUC process and the DRUC process are as follows:\n(a)\tThe HRUC process uses current Resource Status for the initial condition for the first hour of the RUC Study Period.  All HRUC processes use the projected status of transmission breakers and switches starting with current status and updated for each remaining hour in the study as indicated in the COP for Resources and in the Outage Scheduler for transmission elements. \n(b)\tThe DRUC process uses the current hourly forecast of total ERCOT Load including DC Tie Schedules up to the physical rating of the DC Tie for each hour of the Operating Day.  The HRUC process uses the current hourly forecast of total ERCOT Load including DC Tie Schedules up to the physical rating of the DC Tie for each hour in the RUC Study Period.\n(c)\tThe DRUC process uses the Day-Ahead weather forecast for each hour of the Operating Day.  The HRUC process uses the weather forecast information for each hour of the balance of the RUC Study Period.\n(d)\tFor the HRUC, DRUC, and Weekly Reliability Unit Commitment (WRUC) processes, a feasibility check on the COP submitted Hour Beginning Planned SOC will be performed.  This check may adjust the Hour Beginning Planned SOC used in the RUC process.  The feasibility check looks sequentially across all intervals in the RUC Study Period to validate whether a particular interval\u2019s COP Hour Beginning Planned SOC is achievable from the previous interval.  If it is not feasible, then RUC will adjust the Hour Beginning Planned SOC to the closest achievable value.\n(20)\tA QSE with a Resource that is not a Reliability Must-Run (RMR) Unit or has not received an Outage Schedule Adjustment (OSA) that has been committed in a DRUC or HRUC process may opt out of the RUC Settlement (or \u201cbuy back\u201d the commitment) by setting the COP status of the RUC-committed Resource to ONOPTOUT for the first hour of a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours in the Opt Out Snapshot.  All the configurations of the same Combined Cycle Train shall be treated as the same Resource for the purpose of creating the block of RUC-Committed Hours.  A RUC-committed Combined Cycle Generation Resource may opt out of the RUC Settlement by setting the COP status of any Combined Cycle Generation Resource within the same Combined Cycle Train as the RUC-committed Resource to ONOPTOUT for the first hour of a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours in the Opt Out Snapshot.  A Combined Cycle Generation Resource that is RUC-committed from one On-Line configuration in order to transition to a different configuration with additional capacity may opt out of the RUC Settlement following the same rule for RUC-committed Combined Cycle Generation Resources described above.  A QSE that opts out of RUC Settlement forfeits RUC Settlement for the affected Resource for a given block of RUC Buy-Back Hours.  A QSE that opts out of RUC Settlement treatment must make the Resource available to SCED for all RUC Buy-Back Hours.  All hours in a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours that includes the RUC Buy-Back Hour shall be considered RUC Buy-Back Hours.  If a contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours spans more than one Operating Day and a QSE wishes to opt out of RUC Settlement for the RUC-Committed Hours in the second or subsequent Operating Day, the QSE must set its COP status to ONOPTOUT for the first hour of that the first Operating Day in the Opt Out Snapshot of the first Operating Day.\n(21)\tERCOT shall, as soon as practicable, post to the ERCOT website a report identifying those hours that were considered RUC Buy-Back Hours, along with the name of each RUC-committed Resource whose QSE opted out of RUC Settlement.\n(22)\tA Resource that has a Three-Part Supply Offer cleared in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) and subsequently receives a RUC commitment for the Operating Hour for which it was awarded will be treated as if the Resource Status was ONOPTOUT for purposes of Section 6.5.7.3 and Section 6.5.7.3.1, Determination of Real-Time Reliability Deployment Price Adders.\n(23)\tA Resource that has self-committed for an Operating Hour after the RUC Snapshot was taken but before the RUC commitment has been communicated through an XML message for that RUC process and that Operating Hour is included in a block of RUC-committed hours for that RUC process will be treated as if the Resource Status was ONOPTOUT for purposes of Section 6.5.7.3, Section 6.5.7.3.1, and RUC Settlement for the entire block of RUC-committed hours.  A QSE that has a Resource that meets these conditions must make the Resource available to SCED for the entire block of RUC-committed hours.  ERCOT will send the QSE a notification stating the Operating Day and block of hours for which this occurred.\n5.5.3\tCommunication of RUC Commitments and Decommitments\n(1)\tThe output of the RUC process is the cleared Resource commitments and decommitments, and a list of the Off-Line Available Resources having a start-up time of one hour or less.\n(2)\tERCOT shall notify each QSE in the Day-Ahead of the DRUC Resource commitments and advisory decommitments that have been cleared by the RUC for the Resources that QSE represents.  ERCOT shall notify each QSE of the HRUC Resource commitments and decommitments that have been cleared by the RUC for the Resources that QSE represents.  Resource commitments must include the start interval and duration for which the Resource is required to be at least at LSL.  Resource decommitments must include the interval in which the Resource is required to be Off-Line, duration, and reason for the decommitment.  ERCOT shall notify each QSE representing an RMR Unit if that unit has been cleared by the DRUC or HRUC process at the same time that the DRUC and HRUC participants are notified of the results of each such process.  \n(3)\tIf ERCOT communicates HRUC commitments and decommitments verbally to a QSE, then the same Resource attributes communicated programmatically must be communicated when ERCOT gives a verbal Resource commitment or decommitment.\n(4)\tThe QSE shall acknowledge the notice or commitment or decommitment by changing the Resource Status of the affected Resources in the COP for RUC-Committed Intervals.\n5.6\tRUC Cost Eligibility\n5.6.1\tVerifiable Costs\n(1)\tThe Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) is responsible for submitting verifiable costs unless both the QSE and Resource Entity agree that the Resource Entity will have this responsibility, in which case both the QSE and Resource Entity shall submit an affidavit to ERCOT stating this arrangement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, QSEs that submit Power Purchase or Tolling Agreements (PPAs) do not have the option of allowing Resource Entities to file verifiable costs.\n(2)\tMake-Whole Payments for a Resource are based on the Startup Offers and Minimum-Energy Offers for the Resource, limited by caps.  Until ERCOT approves verifiable unit-specific costs for that Resource, the caps are the Resource Category Startup Generic Cap and the Resource Category Minimum-Energy Generic Cap.  When ERCOT approves verifiable unit-specific costs for that Resource the caps are those verifiable unit-specific costs.  A QSE or Resource Entity may file verifiable unit-specific costs for a Resource at any time, but it must file those costs no later than 30 days after five Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) events for that Resource in a calendar year.  A RUC event begins when a Resource receives a RUC instruction to come or stay On-Line and ends the later of when the Resource shuts down or the end of the Operating Day.  The most recent ERCOT-approved verifiable costs must be used going forward. \n(3)\tThese unit-specific verifiable costs may include and are limited to the following average incremental costs:\n(a)\tAllocation of maintenance requirements based on number of starts between maintenance events using, at the option of the QSE or Resource Entity, either:\n(i)\tManufacturer-recommended maintenance schedule; \n(ii)\tHistorical data for the unit and actual maintenance practices; or\n(iii)\tAnother method approved in advance by ERCOT in writing;\n(b)\tStartup fuel calculations based on recorded actual measured flows when the data is available or based on averages of historical flows for similar starts (for example, hot, cold, intermediate) when actual data is not available.  Startup fuel will include filing separately the startup fuel required to reach breaker close and fuel after breaker close to Low Sustained Limit (LSL).

For gas-fired units, the actual fuel costs must be calculated using the actual Seasonal heat rate (which must be supplied to ERCOT with Seasonal heat-rate test data) multiplied by the fuel price plus consideration of a fuel adder that compensates for the transportation and purchasing of spot fuel as described in the Verifiable Cost Manual.  For coal- and lignite-fired units, the actual fuel costs must be calculated using the actual Seasonal heat rate multiplied by a deemed fuel price of $1.50 per MMBtu.  For fuel oil-fired operations, the number of gallons burned must be multiplied by the FOP.\n5.6.2\tRUC Startup Cost Eligibility\n(1)\tFor purposes of this Section 5.6.2, all contiguous RUC-Committed Hours are considered as one RUC instruction.

ERCOT shall settle CRRs with the CRR Account Holder shown on ERCOT records.\n(d)\tDAM \u2013 Qualified Scheduling Entities (QSEs) may bid for PTP Obligations in the DAM. \n(3)\tEach CRR is one of these types:\n(a)\tPTP Option, some of which may be PCRRs;\n(b)\tPTP Obligation, some of which may be PCRRs;\n(c)\tPTP Option with Refund, all of which are PCRRs;\n(d)\tPTP Obligation with Refund, all of which are PCRRs; and\n(e)\tFlowgate Right (FGR).\n7.2\tCharacteristics of Congestion Revenue Rights\n(1)\tEach CRR has the following characteristics:\n(a)\tQuantities are measured in MWs with granularity of tenths of MWs (0.1 MW);\n(b)\tA duration of one hour; \n(c)\tAn ability to be fully tradable financial instruments except in specified time-of-use blocks for a PTP Option with Refund and a PTP Obligation with Refund; and  \n(d)\tA designated source (injection point) that is a Settlement Point and a designated sink (withdrawal point) that is a different Settlement Point, except for a Flowgate Right (FGR), which has a designated directional network element, or a bundle of directional network elements, instead.\n7.2.1\tCRR Naming Convention\n(1)\tThe appropriate TAC subcommittee shall establish a task force that is open to Market Participants, comprised of technical experts, to develop a naming convention for CRRs consistent with the requirements of the Protocols.  The naming convention must be approved by TAC before implementation. \n7.3\tTypes of Congestion Revenue Rights to Be Auctioned\n(1)\tERCOT shall auction the following types of Congestion Revenue Rights (CRRs):\n(a)\tPoint-to-Point (PTP) Options;\n(b)\tPTP Obligations; and\n(c) \tFlowgate Rights (FGRs) that are defined in Section 7.3.1, Flowgates. \n(2)\tPTP Options are evaluated hourly in each CRR Auction as the positive power flows on all directional network elements created by the injection and withdrawal at the specified source and sink points in the quantity represented by the CRR bid or offer (MW), excluding all negative flows on all directional network elements.  \n(3)\tPTP Obligations are evaluated hourly in each CRR Auction as the positive and negative power flows on all directional network elements created by the injection and withdrawal at the specified source and sink points of the quantity represented by the CRR bid or offer (MW).  \n(4)\tPTP Options can only result in payments from ERCOT to the CRR Owner of record.  A PTP Obligation may result in either a payment or a charge to the CRR Owner of record.\n(5)\tCRRs must be auctioned in the following Time Of Use (TOU) blocks (having the same MW amount for each hour within the block):\n(a)\t5x16 blocks for hours ending 0700-2200, Monday through Friday (excluding North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) holidays), in one-month strips;\n(b)\t2x16 blocks for hours ending 0700-2200, Saturday and Sunday, and NERC holidays in one-month strips; and\n(c)\t7x8 blocks for hours ending 0100-0600 and hours ending 2300-2400 Sunday through Saturday, in one-month strips.\n(6)\tCRR Auction bids and Pre-Assigned Congestion Revenue Right (PCRR) nominations must specify a TOU block. \n(7)\tFor the CRR Monthly Auction only, a single block bid may be submitted for all hours in a calendar month, which represents a linked-offer for all three TOU blocks described above in paragraph (5).\n7.3.1\tFlowgates\n7.3.1.1\tProcess for Defining Flowgates\n(1)\tFlowgates where ERCOT offers FGRs may only be created by an amendment to Section 7.3.1.2, Defined Flowgates.  ERCOT shall post the list of all flowgates available for FGRs on the ERCOT website.  If there is any change in the designation of flowgates, ERCOT shall provide notice to all Market Participants as soon as practicable.\n7.3.1.2\tDefined Flowgates\n(1)\tThere are currently no defined flowgates.\n7.4\tPre-Assigned Congestion Revenue Rights Overview\n(1)\tERCOT shall allocate a portion of available Congestion Revenue Rights (CRRs) as Pre-Assigned Congestion Revenue Rights (PCRRs) to Non-Opt-In Entities (NOIEs) that either have established ownership prior to September 1, 1999 in a specific Generation Resource or have a long-term (greater than five years) contractual commitment for annual capacity and energy that was entered into prior to September 1, 1999 from specific Generation Resources.  For purposes of this Section 7.4, such Generation Resources shall be referred to as \u201cpre-September 1, 1999 Generation Resources.\u201d  An existing Generation Resource that interconnected to the ERCOT Transmission Grid on or after June 1, 2021, pursuant to paragraph (3) of Section 1.6.5, Interconnection of New or Existing Generation, cannot qualify as a pre-September 1, 1999 Generation Resource for PCRR purposes. \n(2) \tNOIEs are the only Entities eligible for an allocation of PCRRs.  NOIEs may designate an agent to manage their PCRRs, provided that ERCOT\u2019s relationship is with the NOIE and that an agent shall be subject to all PCRR rules applicable to the NOIE.  ERCOT will rely exclusively on documentation provided or confirmed by the NOIE to determine the continued eligibility for allocation of PCRRs.  \n(3)\tERCOT shall publish a list of NOIEs who are eligible for allocation of PCRRs on the ERCOT website.  The list shall include each NOIE\u2019s ownership and/or contractual amount of capacity related to pre-September 1, 1999 Generation Resources.  The list shall further include the eligible PCRR amounts capped at the net max sustainable rating (MW) of pre-September 1, 1999 Generation Resources as established by 2010 registration data.  ERCOT shall update the list as necessary to reflect current NOIE eligibility for allocation of PCRRs. \n7.4.1\tPCRR Allocation Eligibility\n7.4.1.1\tPCRR Criteria for NOIE Allocation Eligibility\n(1)\tPCRRs shall be limited to pre-September 1, 1999 Generation Resources utilized by a NOIE to serve the Load in its service territory.  The following criteria shall apply for NOIE eligibility for allocation of PCRRs:\n(a)\tA Generation Resource owned by the NOIE nominating the PCRR(s) that meets the following:\n(i)\tThe NOIE owned the Generation Resource prior to September 1, 1999 and has maintained uninterrupted ownership since September 1, 1999;\n(ii)\tThe Generation Resource has remained in service on an uninterrupted basis except for Maintenance Outages, Forced Outages, Opportunity Outages or Planned Outages (including a Mothballed Generation Resource that operates under a Seasonal Operation Period) subsequent to September 1, 1999; and\n(iii)\tThe NOIE utilizes the Generation Resource to meet its electric service obligations within its service territory in an amount at least equal to the nominated PCRR amount. \n(b)\tA Generation Resource that is the subject of a long-term contract between the NOIE nominating the PCRR(s) and another Entity that owns or controls the Generation Resource, provided that the long-term contract meets the following criteria:\n(i)\tThe contract was entered into prior to September 1, 1999 and has remained in effect on an uninterrupted basis since September 1, 1999; \n(ii)\tThe contract term is greater than five years.  Contracts with automatic renewal provisions (evergreen clauses), the operation of which extends beyond the term of the contract to more than the cumulative five years, shall meet this requirement, provided that the automatic renewal provision was in place prior to September 1, 1999;  \n(iii)\tThe NOIE is entitled to capacity from specific Generation Resource(s) pursuant to the long-term contract; long-term contracts that are not backed by specific Generation Resources are not eligible for PCRRs;\n(iv)\tThe Generation Resource(s) that is/are the subject of the long-term contract has/have remained in service on an uninterrupted basis except for Maintenance Outages, Forced Outages, Opportunity Outages or Planned Outages (including a Mothballed Generation Resource that operates under a Seasonal Operation Period) since September 1, 1999; and\n(v)\tThe Generation Resource(s) that is/are the subject of the long-term contract is/are utilized by the NOIE to meet its electric service obligations within its service territory in an amount at least equal to the nominated PCRR amount.\n(c)\tA federally-owned hydroelectric Generation Resource that is the subject of a series of sequential long-term contracts between the NOIE nominating the PCRR(s) and the federal government based upon a long-term (greater than five years) allocation from the federal government for annual capacity and energy produced at such federally-owned hydroelectric Generation Resource, and that allocation was in place prior to September 1, 1999.  \n(d)\tMultiple Generation Resources that are the subject of portfolio supply contracts that meet the requirements of paragraphs (1)(b)(i)-(ii) and (1)(b)(iv)-(v) above and are between a NOIE nominating the PCRR(s) and another non-NOIE.  For the purposes of this Section 7.4.1.1, portfolio supply contract shall mean an agreement under which multiple NOIEs receive wholesale capacity from another non-NOIE pursuant to a portfolio of specific Generation Resources.  Each NOIE who is eligible for PCRRs and is a party to a portfolio supply contract shall be allocated PCRRs based on its 2003 4-Coincident Peak (4-CP) ratio share of each Generation Resource in the portfolio.  The 2003 4-CP ratio share shall be calculated as the 4-CP of each NOIE divided by the total 4-CP of all NOIEs who were supplied by that portfolio of Generation Resources in 2003.  Each NOIE\u2019s capacity entitlement shall be its 2003 4-CP ratio share multiplied by the net max sustainable rating from the 2010 registration data for each PCRR eligible Generation Resource in the portfolio.\n(e)\tThe Direct Current Tie (DC Tie) is considered a PCRR-eligible Generation Resource for contracts of Tex-La Electric Cooperative of Texas, Inc. with supply resources located outside the ERCOT Region that meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(i)-(ii) and (iv)-(v) above.\n(f) \tA Generation Resource that was the subject of a pre-September 1, 1999 long-term contract between the NOIE nominating the PCRR(s) and another Entity that owned or controlled the Generation Resource prior to September 1, 1999, and that has been acquired by the NOIE after September 1, 1999, shall be deemed for all purposes as a NOIE-owned pre-September 1, 1999 Generation Resource for purposes of paragraph (1) of Section 7.4.1.3.1, PCRR Disqualifying Events, provided that an option for the NOIE to acquire the Generation Resource was in place in the long-term contract prior to September 1, 1999.\n7.4.1.2\tNOIE Allocation Eligibility for PCRRs Impacted By Long-Term Outages of Generation Resources and Mothballed Generation Resources\n(1)\tA NOIE maintains allocation eligibility for PCRRs associated with a pre-September 1, 1999 Generation Resource that may be out of service for greater than 12 consecutive months if the Generation Resource is out of service pursuant to a Forced Outage and the time necessary to address the relevant Outage extends beyond 12 months, provided that the NOIE must demonstrate to ERCOT\u2019s satisfaction that the Outage continues to be necessary and does not require the Resource Entity to cease or suspend operation of the Generation Resource pursuant to Section 3.14.1.1, Notification of Suspension of Operations.  \n(a)\tFor a PCRR Nomination Year in which a PCRR-eligible Generation Resource is expected to return to service after a long-term Forced Outage (greater than 12 consecutive months), the NOIE is only eligible to receive PCRRs for the months in which the Generation Resource is expected to be in service for the entirety of the month. \n(b)\tIf the NOIE nominated and was awarded PCRRs during the annual PCRR allocation process for future months based on an anticipated return to service of a PCRR-eligible Generation Resource from a long-term Forced Outage (greater than 12 consecutive months), the NOIE shall notify ERCOT in writing of the intentions of the Resource Entity to return the Generation Resource to service no less than 60 days prior to the first day of the month in which the Generation Resource is scheduled to return to service. This notice requirement to retain allocated PCRRs is separate and distinct from the return to service requirement in Section 3.14.1.9, Generation Resource Status Updates.  If the Generation Resource will not be returned to service for the entirety of a month for which PCRRs were allocated, the associated CRRs will be voided for each impacted month and ERCOT will follow the appropriate option described in Section 7.4.1.3.2, Effect of PCRR Disqualification, in order to maximize the available transmission capacity for future monthly CRR Auctions.  To determine if the NOIE will retain any allocated PCRRs for future months, the NOIE shall provide to ERCOT a new expected return to service date and must follow the notice requirement and timeline in this paragraph above.\n (2)\tA NOIE maintains allocation eligibility for PCRRs associated with a pre-September 1, 1999 Generation Resource if the Generation Resource becomes a Mothballed Generation Resource pursuant to Section 3.14.1.1, Notification of Suspension of Operations, regardless of whether ERCOT determines that the Generation Resource is necessary for Reliability Must-Run (RMR) Service.\n(a)\tHowever, because the Generation Resource will not provide any capacity or energy to serve the NOIE\u2019s Load in its service territory for the period in which it is designated as a Mothballed Generation Resource, a NOIE does not have an exclusive right to retain any allocated PCRRs during this period.  For any retained PCRRs, the NOIE shall follow the process detailed in Section 7.4.1.3.2, Effect of PCRR Disqualification. \n(b)\tFor a PCRR Nomination Year in which a PCRR-eligible Mothballed Generation Resource is expected to return to service (including a Mothballed Generation Resource that operates under a Seasonal Operation Period), the Generation Resource is only eligible for PCRRs for the months it is expected to be in service for the entirety of the month.\n(c)\tIf the NOIE nominated and was awarded PCRRs during the annual PCRR allocation process for future months based on an anticipated return to service of a PCRR-eligible Mothballed Generation Resource, the NOIE shall notify ERCOT in writing of the intentions of the Resource Entity to return the Mothballed Generation Resource to service no less than 60 days prior to the first day of the month in which the Generation Resource is scheduled to return to service.  This notice requirement to retain allocated PCRRs is separate and distinct from the return to service requirement in Section 3.14.1.9.  If the Mothballed Generation Resource will not be returned to service for the entirety of a month for which PCRRs were allocated, the associated CRRs will be voided for each impacted month and ERCOT will follow the appropriate option described in Section 7.4.1.3.2 in order to maximize the available transmission capacity for future monthly CRR Auctions.  To determine if the NOIE will retain any allocated PCRRs for future months, the NOIE shall provide to ERCOT a new expected return to service date and must follow the notice requirement and timeline in this paragraph.\n7.4.1.3\tPCRR Disqualification\n7.4.1.3.1\tPCRR Disqualifying Events\n(1)\tA NOIE that owns a pre-September 1, 1999 Generation Resource shall no longer be eligible for allocation of PCRRs associated with that Generation Resource under the following conditions:\n(a)\tThe Generation Resource is designated as decommissioned and retired pursuant to Section 3.14.1.1, Notification of Suspension of Operations, regardless of whether ERCOT determines that the Generation Resource is necessary for RMR Service.  \n(b)\tThe Generation Resource is sold by the NOIE to another Entity, regardless of whether the NOIE later enters into a long-term supply contract with that Entity to serve the NOIE\u2019s Load in its service territory.  The selling of a Generation Resource shall include the transfer of ownership of the Generation Resource and/or the sale of the energy and/or capacity of the Generation Resource pursuant to a contractual agreement.  However, a transfer of the Generation Resource to an Affiliate of the NOIE or to a generation and transmission Electric Cooperative (EC) for the benefit of the NOIE shall not serve as a disqualifying event as long as all other PCRR eligibility requirements remain in place.  \n(2)\tA NOIE that has a long-term contract with a pre-September 1, 1999 Generation Resource under paragraph (1)(b) of Section 7.4.1.1, PCRR Criteria for NOIE Allocation Eligibility, shall no longer be eligible for allocation of PCRRs associated with that Generation Resource upon termination of the long-term contract.  For purposes of this Section 7.4.1.3.1, termination of the relevant long-term contract shall include:\n(a)\tThe Generation Resource is designated as decommissioned and retired pursuant to Section 3.14.1.1, regardless of whether ERCOT determines that the Generation Resource is necessary for RMR Service.\n(b)\tAny change in control of the capacity under the contract, including, but not limited to, assignment of the contract to another Entity.  The foregoing notwithstanding, a NOIE shall still be eligible to receive PCRRs if the capacity under the contract is transferred to another Entity or a generation and transmission EC for the benefit of the NOIE, the Entity or the generation and transmission EC continues to supply the NOIE under the same terms and conditions of the long-term contract, and the contract continues to meet all other relevant PCRR eligibility requirements.  \n(c) \tAny change in the designation of Generation Resources backing a long-term contract after September 1, 1999, shall disqualify the long-term contract.\n(d)\tIf the termination of a long-term contract applies to less than 100% of the capacity entitlement, the remaining capacity entitlement shall continue to qualify for PCRRs for the MW amount under the portion of the long-term contract that is not terminated, provided that the long-term contract otherwise continues to meet all other PCRR eligibility requirements.  \n(3)\tA NOIE that has a long-term portfolio supply contract under paragraph (1)(d) of Section 7.4.1.1 shall no longer be eligible for allocation of PCRRs associated with these pre-September 1, 1999 Generation Resources upon termination of the portfolio supply contract.  For the purposes of this subsection, termination shall have the same meaning as defined in paragraph (2) above.  Following termination of a portfolio supply contract(s) for a NOIE or group of NOIEs, the capacity entitlements remaining under the existing portfolio supply contract(s) shall continue to reflect the 2003 4-CP ratio share values, as described in paragraph (1)(d) of Section 7.4.1.1.  \n(4)\tA NOIE that has a long-term contract across the DC Tie with supply resources located outside the ERCOT Region pursuant to paragraph (1)(e) of Section 7.4.1.1 shall no longer be eligible for allocation of PCRRs upon termination of the relevant external supply contract(s).  For purposes of this Section 7.4.1.3.1, termination shall have the same meaning as defined in paragraph (2) above.  If the termination of the external supply contract(s) applies to less than 100% of the capacity entitlement, the remaining capacity entitlement shall continue to qualify for PCRRs for the MW amount under the portion of the external supply contract(s) that is not terminated, provided that the external supply contract(s) continues to meet all other PCRR eligibility requirements.  \n(5)\tA NOIE that has long-term contracts pursuant to paragraph (1)(b) of Section 7.4.1.1, portfolio supply contracts pursuant to paragraph (1)(d) of Section 7.4.1.1 or long-term contracts pursuant to paragraph (1)(e) of Section 7.4.1.1 that did not contain automatic renewal provisions (evergreen clauses) in the original contracts and were subsequently revised to extend the term of the relevant contracts after September 1, 1999, shall not be eligible for allocation of PCRRs upon expiration of the original terms of the contracts (i.e. the date the contract would have expired but for extension of the term pursuant to post-September 1, 1999 contract modifications).  Disqualification pursuant to this Section 7.4.1.3.1 applies to any type of term extension modifications after September 1, 1999, whether they are automatic renewal provisions (evergreen clauses) or other renewal and extension provisions. \n(6)\tA NOIE shall no longer be eligible for allocation of PCRRs after it opts into competition, with the exception of South Texas Electric Cooperative Inc. (STEC).  STEC may be eligible for allocation of PCRRs for up to three years after the date it enters into competition.\n7.4.1.3.2\tEffect of PCRR Disqualification\n(1)\tOnce a disqualifying event occurs under Section 7.4.1.3.1, PCRR Disqualifying Events, the PCRRs associated with the pre-September 1, 1999 Generation Resource shall be voided by ERCOT from the date of the disqualifying event.  Further, the NOIE will no longer be eligible for allocation of future PCRRs associated with the pre-September 1, 1999 Generation Resource. \n(2)\tHowever, if a disqualifying event occurs during the effective term of the PCRRs, the NOIE who was allocated the PCRRs shall select one of the options below to address the remaining allocated PCRRs.\n(a)\tIf the NOIE maintains PCRR-related CRRs in its CRR Account, then the CRRs associated with the PCRR allocation shall either:\n(i)\tBe voided by ERCOT at the time of the disqualifying event and ERCOT shall refund the NOIE the discounted purchase price of the CRR as soon as practicable; or\n(ii)\tBe retained by the NOIE and the NOIE pays ERCOT the price differential between the discounted CRR price and the full CRR Auction price in which the CRR was acquired. \n(b)\tIf the NOIE no longer maintains PCRR-related CRRs (sale, transfer, etc.), then the NOIE pays ERCOT the price differential between the discounted CRR price and the full CRR Auction price in which the CRR was acquired.\n(c)\tIf the NOIE obtained PCRR-related CRRs through the Refund option (allocated at no charge), then ERCOT will void the CRRs at the time of the disqualifying event and no financial exchange is necessary.\n7.4.2\tPCRR Allocation and Nomination Terms and Conditions\n7.4.2.1\tPCRR Allocation and Nomination Amounts\n(1)\tPCRR allocations shall be limited to the Seasonal net max sustainable rating (MW) of eligible pre-September 1, 1999 Generation Resources, but shall in no event exceed the net max sustainable rating (MW) of these pre-September 1, 1999 Generation Resources as established by 2010 registration data.  If a Generation Resource is repowered by the addition of new equipment, the PCRR MW amount is limited to the original specific turbine/generator set(s) from the pre-September 1, 1999 Generation Resource.  New or upgraded components that increase the capacity of pre-September 1, 1999 Generation Resources are not eligible for increased PCRR MW amounts.\n(2)\tPCRR nominations shall be based on forecasted peak Demand, subject to the relevant PCRR allocation MW capacity limit of the specific Generation Resources.    \n(3)\tThe PCRR allocation amounts for individual NOIEs relative to multiple Generation Resources under a portfolio supply contract shall be based on the following:\n(a)\tIf the portfolio supply contract specifically describes the NOIE capacity entitlement from each specific Generation Resource, the PCRR allocation amount from each Generation Resource shall be based on the contractual rights.\n(b)\tIf the portfolio supply contract does not specifically describe the NOIE capacity entitlement from each specific Generation Resource, the PCRR allocation amount shall be based on the NOIE\u2019s 2003 4-Coincident Peak (4-CP) ratio share of each Generation Resource in the portfolio.  The 2003 4-CP ratio share shall be calculated as the 4-CP of each NOIE divided by the total 4-CP of all NOIEs who were supplied by that portfolio of Generation Resources in 2003.  Each NOIE\u2019s capacity entitlement shall be its 2003 4-CP ratio share multiplied by the net max sustainable rating from the 2010 registration data for each PCRR eligible Generation Resource in the portfolio.\n(4)\tIf a NOIE serves Load in more than one Load Zone, it shall nominate PCRRs to each Load Zone in an amount equal to the explicit contractual rights to each Load Zone, if any, or in proportion to the peak Load served in each relevant Load Zone, based on the aggregated monthly Load data from the corresponding prior 12 months.\n7.4.2.2\tPCRR Allocations and Nominations\n(1)\tERCOT shall allocate CRRs under the following terms and conditions:\n(a)\tERCOT shall conduct studies to evaluate whether the nominated PCRRs comply with feasibility constraints using the simultaneous feasibility test described in Section 7.5.5.4, Simultaneous Feasibility Test.  A PCRR nomination is a request for one-month strips of a NOIE-specified CRR type for amounts and blocks specified by the NOIE for each month of the PCRR Nomination Year as described in paragraph (c) below.  The Simultaneous Feasibility Test (SFT) evaluation to determine the feasible PCRR allocation amount for each month being evaluated uses 100% of that month\u2019s expected network topology, which may result in different amounts allocated in different months.  If the SFT evaluation indicates that the nominated PCRR amounts are not feasible, then ERCOT shall proportionately reduce the requested PCRRs by their Impact Ratio on violated constraints.  The \u201cImpact Ratio\u201d is the amount of a particular PCRR\u2019s impact divided by the total impact of all PCRRs in the same direction on a violated constraint.  The price that a NOIE must pay for an allocated PCRR is based on the corresponding CRR clearing price in the CRR First Offering.  The invoicing and payment for a PCRR allocated according to the process in this paragraph follows the same process and timeline as the invoicing and payment of CRR bids cleared in the CRR First Offering.  \n(b)\tERCOT shall allocate all PCRRs in quantities truncated to the nearest tenth MW (0.1 MW).\n(c)\tEach eligible NOIE may nominate and ERCOT shall allocate to that NOIE as so nominated, subject to the limitation of paragraph (a) above, PCRRs up to 100% of the amount allowed pursuant to Section 7.4.2.1, PCRR Allocation and Nomination Amounts, for each eligible Resource, except as noted below in paragraph (d).  Prior to the first CRR Long-Term Auction Sequence held in any given calendar year, the NOIE must nominate PCRRs for each month of the PCRR Nomination Year.  Nominations must be received at ERCOT no later than 30 Business Days prior to the commencement of the CRR Long-Term Auction Sequence.  ERCOT shall allocate PCRRs to the NOIE no later than 25 Business Days prior to the CRR Long-Term Auction Sequence.  There shall not be any PCRR nomination process leading up to the second CRR Long-Term Auction Sequence (if any) in a calendar year. \n(d)\tPrior to each CRR Monthly Auction, if there existed any PCRR nominations for the month being auctioned that ERCOT determined were not feasible at the time of the CRR Long-Term Auction Sequence in which they were originally considered, resulting in proportionally reduced PCRR allocations, then ERCOT shall re-evaluate the full nomination and allocate additional PCRRs, if feasible, up to the original nomination amount.  The price that a NOIE must pay for a PCRR allocated by the process in this paragraph is based on the corresponding CRR clearing price in the CRR Monthly Auction according to the pricing methodology in item (h) below, and the invoicing and payment for such a PCRR follows the same process and timeline as the invoicing and payment of CRR bids cleared in the CRR Monthly Auction.\n(e)\tA NOIE must designate whether to accept the refund option or the capacity option for its eligible non-solid fuel and non-combined-cycle Resources before the allocation of PCRRs.  The designated option (refund or capacity) will be the same for every month of the allocation year for that Resource.  A NOIE cannot designate a combination of both options for the same Resource in a given allocation year.  These options are described in items (i) and (ii) below.  NOIEs, or a group of NOIEs linked by common pre-1999 power supply arrangements, which had a 2003 NOIE peak Load in excess of 2,300 MW must use the capacity option (ii) for their eligible non-solid-fuel and non-combined-cycle Resources.  NOIEs that receive PCRRs representing gas steam Resources, hydro, wind, simple cycle or other similar Resources across high voltage DC Ties must use the capacity option (ii) for those eligible non-solid-fuel and non-combined-cycle Resources:\n(i)\tRefund option \u2013 The eligible NOIE may nominate up to 100% of the lesser of the net unit capacity or contractual amount for those Resource amounts allowed pursuant to Section 7.4.2.1.  The eligible NOIE shall refund to ERCOT any congestion revenues received above those congestion revenues flowing to the NOIE for its Output Schedule of the Resource at the PCRR source.  PCRR settlement will reflect the MW value of the Output Schedule of the Resource at the PCRR source, regardless of what MW value of actual output occurred during that interval if that change in output is in response to Dispatch Instructions.  The refund for any Settlement Interval is equal to the difference between the PCRR MW amount and the time-weighted average of the Output Schedules of the Resource at the PCRR source multiplied by the value of that PCRR.  PCRRs allocated under the refund option are not transferable and may only be used by the NOIE to which they are allocated. \n(ii)\tCapacity option \u2013 The eligible NOIE may nominate up to 100% of the lesser of the net unit capacity or contractual amount for those Resource amounts allowed pursuant to Section 7.4.2.1 at a capacity factor no greater than 40% over each calendar year.  ERCOT shall allocate PCRRs in accordance with the NOIE nominations subject to the SFT.\n(A)\tDuring the nomination process, the NOIE must nominate the months (designating CRR amounts as defined by the criteria specified in item (5) of Section 7.3, Types of Congestion Revenue Rights to Be Auctioned) for which it will use its PCRRs (i.e., the NOIE may shape the PCRRs representing up to 100% of the capacity for each Resource at a capacity factor no greater than 40% over each calendar year). \n(B)\tIf a Resource eligible for PCRRs is shut down due to a Force Majeure Event, then, to the extent feasible, the NOIE may reallocate its PCRRs across its PCRR-eligible facilities before the CRR Monthly Auction.  This change is effective no later than the date of the CRR Monthly Auction, and the redesignation may be requested for each CRR Monthly Auction during the Force Majeure Event.  Any price difference in the reconfigured rights must be paid by (or paid to) the NOIE.\n(f)\tThe CRR type, either Point-to-Point (PTP) Option, PTP Obligation, or a combination, must be specified by the eligible NOIE before the PCRR allocation and is binding for purchase.  Once the allocation process is complete, the eligible NOIE may not change the CRR type. \n(g)\tAfter the allocation process, and the subsequent applicable CRR Auction, PCRRs other than those described in item (iii) below must be priced as a percentage of the applicable CRR Auction clearing price for the applicable CRR, as follows:\n(i)\tPTP Option PCRRs:\n(A)\tNuclear, coal, lignite or combined-cycle Resources: 10% of the applicable CRR Auction clearing prices;\n(B)\tGas steam Resources: 15% of the applicable CRR Auction clearing prices; or\n(C)\tHydro, wind, simple cycle, or other Resources not included in (A) or (B): 20% of the applicable CRR Auction clearing prices.\n(ii)\tPTP Obligation PCRRs:\n(A)\tNuclear, coal, lignite or combined-cycle Resources: 5% of the applicable CRR Auction clearing price if it is positive; 100% of the applicable CRR Auction clearing price if it is negative;\n(B)\tGas steam Resources: 7.5% of the applicable CRR Auction clearing price if such price is positive; 100% of the applicable CRR Auction clearing price if it is negative; or\n(C)\tHydro, wind, simple cycle, or other Resources not included in (A) or (B): 10% of the applicable CRR Auction clearing prices if it is positive; 100% of the applicable CRR Auction clearing prices if it is negative.\n(iii)\tFor a NOIE that has chosen the refund option, the allocated number of PCRRs for Resources other than solid-fuel and combined-cycle Resources are provided at no charge.\n(h)\tPCRRs shall not be able to be bilaterally traded through ERCOT systems prior to the completion of the CRR Auction used to determine their value.\n7.5\tCRR Auctions\n7.5.1\tNature and Timing\n(1)\tThe Congestion Revenue Right (CRR) Auction auctions the available network capacity of the ERCOT transmission system not allocated as described in Section 7.4, Preassigned Congestion Revenue Rights Overview, or sold in a previous auction.  The CRR Auction also allows CRR Owners an opportunity to offer for sale CRRs that they hold.  Each CRR Auction allows for the purchase of CRR products as described in paragraph (5) of Section 7.3, Types of Congestion Revenue Rights to Be Auctioned, in strips of one or more consecutive months and allows for the reconfiguration of all CRR blocks that were previously awarded for the months covered by that CRR Auction.\n(2)\tThe CRR Network Model must be based on, but is not the same as, the Network Operations Model.  For the purposes of CRR Network Model construction for a CRR Long-Term Auction Sequence, ERCOT may, at its sole discretion, utilize the same or similar CRR Network Model inputs for multiple consecutive months.  The CRR Network Model must, to the extent practicable, include the same topology, contingencies, and operating procedures as used in the Network Operations Model as reasonably expected to be in place for each month.  The expected network topology used in the CRR Network Model for any month or set of months must include all Outages from the Outage Scheduler and identified by ERCOT as expected to have a significant impact upon transfer capability during that time.  These Outages included in the CRR Network Model shall be posted on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area consistent with model posting requirements by ERCOT with accompanying cause and duration information, as indicated in the Outage Scheduler.  Transmission system upgrades and changes must be accounted for in the CRR Network Model for CRR Auctions held after the month in which the element is placed into service.  \n(a)\tERCOT shall use Dynamic Ratings in the CRR Network Model as required under Section 3.10.8, Dynamic Ratings.\n(b)\tThe CRR Network Model must use the peak Load conditions of the month or set of months being modeled. \n(c)\tERCOT\u2019s criteria for determining if an Outage should be in the CRR Network Model shall be in accordance with these Protocols and described in the Operating Guides.\n(3)\tERCOT shall model bids and offers into the CRR Auction as flows based on the MW offer and defined source and sink.  When the Simultaneous Feasibility Test (SFT) is run, the model must weight the power flow buses and Hub Buses included in a Hub or Load Zone appropriately to determine the system impacts of the CRRs.\n(a)\tTo distribute injections and withdrawals to buses within a Hub, ERCOT shall use distribution factors specified in Section 3.5.2, Hub Definitions.\n(b)\tTo distribute injections and withdrawals to power flow buses in Load Zones, ERCOT shall use the Load-weighted distribution factors for On-Peak Hours in each Load Zone.  For a CRR Monthly Auction, ERCOT shall derive CRR Auction Load distribution factors with the set of Load distribution factors constructed in accordance with the ERCOT Load distribution factor methodology specified in paragraph (5) of Section 4.5.1, DAM Clearing Process, for use in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM).  For a CRR Long-Term Auction Sequence, ERCOT shall derive CRR Auction Load distribution factors from the corresponding planning model or with the set of Load distribution factors constructed in accordance with the ERCOT Load distribution factor methodology specified in paragraph (5) of Section 4.5.1, for use in the DAM.  ERCOT shall notify the market as to which method was used for each CRR Network Model in a CRR Long-Term Auction Sequence in the corresponding auction notice.  ERCOT shall post the CRR Auction Load distribution factors as part of the CRR Network Model pre-auction posting.  Private Use Network net Load will be redacted from this posting. \n[NPRR1004:  Replace paragraph (b) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(b)\tTo distribute injections and withdrawals to power flow buses in Load Zones, ERCOT shall use the Load-weighted distribution factors for On-Peak Hours in each Load Zone.  For CRR Auctions and allocations, ERCOT shall derive Load distribution factors with the set of Load distribution factors constructed in accordance with the ERCOT Load distribution factor methodology specified in paragraph (c) of Section 3.12, Load Forecasting.  ERCOT shall post the CRR Auction Load distribution factors as part of the CRR Network Model pre-auction posting.  Private Use Network net Load will be redacted from this posting. \n(4)\tERCOT shall conduct CRR Auctions as follows:\n(a)\tThe CRR Monthly Auction, held once per calendar month, shall include the sale of one-month terms of Point-to-Point (PTP) Options and PTP Obligations for the month immediately following the month during which the CRR bid submission window closes.\n(b)\tTwice per year, a CRR Long-Term Auction Sequence shall be held, selling PTP Options and PTP Obligations, subject to the following constraints:\n(i)\tEach CRR Long-Term Auction Sequence shall consist of six successive CRR Auctions, each of which offers for sale CRRs spanning a term of six consecutive calendar months (either January through June, or July through December).  In each such CRR Auction, CRRs shall be offered in one-month strips or in strips of up to six consecutive months within the term covered by the auction.\n(ii)\tThe CRR Long-Term Auction Sequence shall operate in chronological order, first providing a CRR Auction covering the next six-month (January through June, or July through December) period that has not yet commenced, and then five successive CRR Auctions for the five six-month periods thereafter.\n(c)\tNo later than April 1 of each calendar year, ERCOT shall publish an update to the CRR activity calendar on the ERCOT website, with the following requirements:\n(i)\tThe calendar shall include activity dates for all CRR Monthly Auctions, all CRR Auctions that are part of a CRR Long-Term Auction Sequence, and all Pre-Assigned Congestion Revenue Right (PCRR) annual allocations for the remainder of the current calendar year and for the two subsequent calendar years. \n(ii)\tAny posted date on the CRR activity calendar shall only be modified if ERCOT determines that the successful execution of the auction would be jeopardized without such modification.  If a delay in completion of a CRR Auction that is part of a CRR Long-Term Auction Sequence results in a condition whereby an overlap of credit posting requirements for consecutive CRR Auctions within that sequence would occur, subsequent CRR Auctions within the sequence shall be delayed by the minimum amount of time required to relieve such overlap.  For any changes to the posted auction activity dates, ERCOT will send a Market Notice to provide the new date(s) and to explain the need for the change.\n(iii)\tThe CRR activity calendar must be approved by the Wholesale Market Subcommittee (WMS) prior to the annual posting.\n(5)\tFor each CRR Auction, the CRR Auction Capacity shall be defined as follows:\n(a)\tFor the CRR Monthly Auction, 90%.\n(b)\tFor any CRR Auction that is part of a CRR Long-Term Auction Sequence, 70%, 55%, 40%, 30%, 20%, or 10% for the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth six-month windows sold in the sequence, respectively.\n(6)\tFor any month covered by a CRR Auction that is part of a CRR Long-Term Auction Sequence, ERCOT shall offer network capacity equal to:\n(a)\tThe expected network topology for that month, scaled down to the CRR Auction Capacity percentage; minus \n(b)\tAll outstanding CRRs that were previously allocated for the month, scaled down to the CRR Auction Capacity percentage; minus \n(c)\tAll outstanding CRRs that were previously awarded for the month in any previous CRR Auction.\n(7)\tFor the CRR Monthly Auction, ERCOT shall offer network capacity equal to the difference between: \n(a)\tThe expected transmission network topology in the CRR Network Model of the month for which the CRRs are effective scaled down to the CRR Auction Capacity percentage; and\n(b)\tAll outstanding CRRs that were previously awarded or allocated for the month.\n7.5.2\tCRR Auction Offers and Bids\n(1)\tTo submit bids or offers into a CRR Auction, an Entity must become a CRR Account Holder and satisfy financial assurance criteria required to participate, under Section 16.8, Registration and Qualification of Congestion Revenue Rights Account Holders.\n(2)\tIn order to enforce a volume limitation on the number of market transactions (bids and offers) submitted into the CRR Auction, ERCOT shall evaluate the maximum number of transactions which are available prior to the auction, and evenly divide the limit across the CRR Account Holders eligible to submit bids or offers according to paragraph (1) above.  This limit shall be designated as the preliminary allocated CRR transaction limit.  A CRR Auction Notice will be provided to all CRR Account Holders prior to each auction.  The CRR Auction Notice will include the following ERCOT determined limitations for each CRR Monthly Auction and each Long-Term Auction Sequence: the preliminary allocated CRR transaction limit; the maximum overall transaction limits; time-of-use transaction limits; and per-CRR Account Holder transaction limits.\n(a)\tPrior to executing the CRR Auction but after the transaction submission window is closed, ERCOT shall determine which of the CRR Account Holders are Participating CRR Account Holders for that CRR Auction.  ERCOT shall then calculate a final allocated CRR transaction limit by evenly dividing the number of available transactions across the Participating CRR Account Holders.\n(b)\tIf the total number of transactions submitted by all Participating CRR Account Holders into the CRR Auction does not exceed the maximum number of transactions available prior to the auction, then the final allocated CRR transaction limit will not apply and all transactions will be accepted.\n(c)\tWithin one hour after the close of each CRR Auction, ERCOT shall notify all CRR Account Holders of the total number of transactions submitted by all Participating CRR Account Holders and whether or not a transaction adjustment period is necessary.  ERCOT may determine that a transaction adjustment period is not necessary if the total number of transactions submitted by all Participating CRR Account Holders does not exceed the number of transactions that can be processed by the CRR Auction system.\n(d)\tIf ERCOT announces a transaction adjustment period, ERCOT shall notify all CRR Account Holders of the final allocated transaction limit and reject all transactions submitted by each Participating CRR Account Holder whose sum total of transactions submitted to the affected CRR Auction exceeds the final allocated transaction limit.  Each Participating CRR Account Holder may then adjust their transactions while respecting the final allocated CRR transaction limitation for the affected CRR Auction within one Business Day.  ERCOT will then execute the CRR Auction using the updated set of transactions as revised by Market Participants.\n(e)\tEach Counter-Party is limited to a total of three CRR Account Holders. \n(f)\tERCOT shall determine a charge for each PTP Option bid awarded in each CRR Auction as described in Section 7.7, Point-to-Point (PTP) Option Award Charge.\n[NPRR936:  Replace paragraph (2) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(2)\tIn order to enforce a volume limitation on the number of market transactions (bids and offers) submitted into the CRR Auction, ERCOT shall evaluate the maximum number of transactions which are available prior to the auction, and evenly divide the limit across the Counter-Parties that are associated with CRR Account Holders eligible to submit bids or offers according to paragraph (1) above.  This limit shall be designated as the preliminary allocated CRR transaction limit.  A CRR Auction Notice will be provided to all CRR Account Holders prior to each auction.

and\n(c)\tTotal MWs held by that account holder.  \n7.5.5.3\tAuction Process\n(1)\tThe CRR Auction must be a single-round, simultaneous auction for selling the CRRs available for all auction products.  ERCOT shall enter into the CRR Auction system a credit limit for each Counter-Party that has at least one CRR Account Holder.  A Counter-Party\u2019s CRR Auction credit limit is equal to the lesser of the credit limit as determined in Section 16.11.4.6.1, Credit Requirements for CRR Auction Participation, or, if provided, the Counter-Party\u2019s self-imposed CRR Auction credit limit for the CRR Monthly Auction or for a time-of-use within a CRR Auction held as part of a CRR Long-Term Auction Sequence.  \n(2)\tPrior to the CRR Auction, ERCOT will conduct a two-part pre-auction screening process. First, if the Counter-Party\u2019s CRR Auction credit limit is greater than that Counter-Party\u2019s credit exposure as defined below using the CRR bid volumes rather than awarded volumes, then the Counter-Party\u2019s CRR Auction credit limit will be ignored as the CRR Auction is solved.  Second, for each CRR Account Holder of a Counter-Party, if the CRR Account Holder\u2019s self-imposed credit limit is greater than that CRR Account Holder\u2019s credit exposure as defined below, then the CRR Account Holder\u2019s self-imposed credit limit will be ignored as the CRR Auction is solved. \n\tThe calculated exposure for the pre-auction screening for each CRR Account Holder is the sum of the credit exposure for PTP Obligation bids, PTP Obligation offers, and PTP Option bids for that CRR Account Holder.  The calculated exposure for the pre-auction screening for each Counter-Party is the sum of the credit exposure for PTP Obligation bids, PTP Obligation offers, and PTP Option bids for that Counter-Party.  PTP Option offers have zero credit exposure.  Separately, for PTP Obligation bids, PTP Obligation offers, and PTP Option bids, for each source/sink Settlement Point combination, the credit exposure will use the bid price and MW quantity that produces the maximum credit exposure that could result from the CRR Auction for that source/sink Settlement Point combination. \n(3)\tThe credit constraint for each Counter-Party is based on the following calculation:\nACR b \t\t= \tAOBLCR b  + AOPTCR b  - AOBLCRO b\nWhere:\t\nAOBLCR b = \t\u2211m \u2211h \u2211j, k [(BOBLMW m, h,(j, k), b * (Max(0, BPOBL m, h,(j, k), b) \u2013 Min(0,A ci99, m, h,(j, k), b, EACP m, h,(j, k) )))] \nAOPTCR b = \t\u2211m \u2211h \u2211j, k [(BOPTMW m, h,(j, k), b * BPOPT m, h,(j, k), b)]\nAOBLCRO b = \t\u2211m \u2211h \u2211j, k (OOBLMW m, h,(j, k), b * Min(0, OPOBL m, h,(j, k), b))  \nThe above variables are defined as follows:\nVariable\tUnit\tDescription\nACR b\t$\tAuction Credit Requirement\u2014The auction credit requirement for a Counter-Party b.\nAOBLCR b\t$\tAuction PTP Obligation Credit Requirement\u2014The auction credit requirement for all PTP Obligation bids submitted by a Counter-Party b for all Operating Days. \nBOBLMW m, h, (j, k), b\tMW\tAwarded Bid PTP Obligation\u2014The awarded bid PTP Obligation with the source j and sink k for the hour h, and month m submitted by a Counter-Party b.\nBPOBL m, h, (j, k), b\t$/MW per hour\tBid Price for PTP Obligation\u2014Bid Price for PTP Obligation with the source j and sink k for the hour h, and month m submitted by a Counter-Party b. \nA ci 99, m, h, (j, k), b\t$/MW per hour\tPath-Specific DAM-Based Adder\u2014The path-specific DAM-based adder with the source j and sink k for the hour h, and month m submitted by a Counter-Party b; calculated as 99th percentile of the average rolling consecutive DAM settled price for the reference CRR source/sink over a period that represents a month for each product type (18 days for 5*16, 8 days for 2*16, 28 days for 7*8).

Nothing in this Section changes the process for amending the Operating Guides.  The metrics developed by ERCOT and approved by TAC and the ERCOT Board must include the provisions of this Section.\n(2)\tEach QSE and Resource shall meet performance measures as described in this Section and in the Operating Guides.\n(3)\tERCOT shall monitor and post the following categories of performance:\n(a)\tReal-Time data, for QSEs:\n(i)\tTelemetry performance;\n(b)\tRegulation control performance, for QSEs and as applicable, Resource-specific performance (see also Section 8.1.1, QSE Ancillary Service Performance Standards);\n(c)\tHydro responsive testing for Generation Resources;\n(d)\tSupplying and validating data for generator models, as requested by ERCOT, for Generation Resources;\n[NPRR1246:  Replace item (d) above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]\n(d)\tSupplying and validating data for generator models, as requested by ERCOT, for Generation Resources and Energy Storage Resources (ESRs);\n(e)\tOutage scheduling and coordination, for QSEs and Resources;\n(f)\tResource-specific Responsive Reserve (RRS) performance for QSEs and Resources;\n(g)\tResource-specific Non-Spinning Reserve (Non-Spin) performance, for QSEs and Resources;\n(h)\tResource-specific ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service (ECRS) performance for QSEs and Resources;\n(i)\tOutage reporting, by QSEs for Resources;\n(j)\tCurrent Operating Plan (COP) metrics, for QSEs; and\n(k)\tDay-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (DRUC) and Hourly Reliability Unit Commitment (HRUC) commitment performance by QSEs and Generation Resources. \n[NPRR1239:  Replace paragraph (3) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(3)\tERCOT shall monitor and post the following categories of performance:\n(a)\tReal-Time data, for QSEs:\n(i)\tTelemetry performance;\n(b)\tRegulation control performance, for QSEs and as applicable, Resource-specific performance (see also Section 8.1.1, QSE Ancillary Service Performance Standards);\n(c)\tHydro responsive testing for Generation Resources, on the ERCOT website;\n(d)\tSupplying and validating data for generator models, as requested by ERCOT, for Generation Resources;\n(e)\tOutage scheduling and coordination, for QSEs and Resources;\n(f)\tResource-specific Responsive Reserve (RRS) performance for QSEs and Resources, on the ERCOT website;\n(g)\tResource-specific Non-Spinning Reserve (Non-Spin) performance, for QSEs and Resources, on the ERCOT website;\n(h)\tResource-specific ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service (ECRS) performance for QSEs and Resources, on the ERCOT website;\n(i)\tOutage reporting, by QSEs for Resources;\n(j)\tCurrent Operating Plan (COP) metrics, for QSEs, on the ERCOT website; and\n(k)\tDay-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (DRUC) and Hourly Reliability Unit Commitment (HRUC) commitment performance by QSEs and Generation Resources, on the ERCOT website.\n8.1.1\tQSE Ancillary Service Performance Standards\n(1)\tEach QSE and its Resources that provide Ancillary Service must meet performance measures set out in these Protocols and the Operating Guides.  ERCOT shall develop a TAC- and ERCOT Board-approved Ancillary Service monitoring program to evaluate the performance of QSEs and Resources providing Ancillary Services prior to the Texas Nodal Market Implementation Date.  This program must include monitoring of capacity availability and energy deployments as described below and in Section 6.5.7.5, Ancillary Services Capacity Monitor.\n8.1.1.1\tAncillary Service Qualification and Testing\n(1)\tEach QSE and the Resource providing Ancillary Service must meet qualification criteria to operate satisfactorily with ERCOT.  ERCOT shall use the Ancillary Service qualification and testing program that is approved by TAC and included in the Operating Guides.  Each QSE for the Resources that it represents may only provide Ancillary Services on those Resources for which it has met the qualification criteria.\n(2)\tGeneral capacity testing must be used to verify a Resource\u2019s Net Dependable Capability.  Qualification tests allow the Resource and QSE to demonstrate the minimum capabilities necessary to deploy an Ancillary Service.  \n(3)\tA Resource may be provisionally qualified for a period of 90 days and may be eligible to participate as a Resource providing Ancillary Service.  Resources that have installed the appropriate equipment with verifiable testing data may be provisionally qualified as providers of Ancillary Service. \n(4)\tA Load Resource may be provisionally qualified for a period of 90 days to participate as a Resource providing Ancillary Service, if the Load Resource is metered with an Interval Data Recorder (IDR) to ERCOT\u2019s reasonable satisfaction.  A Load Resource providing Ancillary Service in Real-Time must meet the following requirements:\n(a)\tElectric Service Identifier (ESI ID) registration of Load Resources providing Ancillary Service by the QSE; and\n(b)\tLoad Resource telemetry is installed and tested between QSE and ERCOT.\n(5)\tProvisional qualification as described herein may be revoked by ERCOT at any time for any non-compliance with provisional qualification requirements.\n(6)\tFor those Settlement Intervals during which a Generation Resource or Load Resource behind the Generation Resource Node is engaged in testing in accordance with this Section, the provisions of Section 6.6.5, Generation Resource Base-Point Deviation Charge, will not apply to the Resource being tested beginning with the Settlement Interval immediately preceding the Settlement Interval in which ERCOT issues a Dispatch Instruction that begins the test and continuing until the end of the Settlement Interval in which the test completes.  During the same Settlement Intervals for the testing period, the Generation Resource Energy Deployment Performance (GREDP) calculated in accordance with Section 8.1.1.4.1, Regulation Service and Generation Resource/Controllable Load Resource Energy Deployment Performance, and Ancillary Service Capacity Performance Metrics, will not apply.\n(7)\tERCOT may reduce the amount a Resource may contribute toward Ancillary Service if it determines unsatisfactory performance of the Resource as defined in Section 8.1.1, QSE Ancillary Service Performance Standards.\n(8)\tTo maintain qualification with ERCOT to provide RRS or ECRS, each Load Resource, excluding Controllable Load Resources (CLRs), will be subject to a Load interruption test at a date and time determined by ERCOT and known only to ERCOT and the affected Transmission Service Provider (TSP), to verify the ability to respond to an ERCOT Dispatch Instruction.  To successfully pass this test, within ten minutes of the receipt of the ERCOT Dispatch Instruction by the Load Resource\u2019s QSE, the Load Resource\u2019s response shall not be less than 95% of the requested MW deployment, nor more than 150% of the lesser of the following: \n(a)\tThe Resource\u2019s Responsibility for ECRS and RRS; or\n(b)\tThe requested MW deployment.\nThe requested MW deployment will be the sum of the Resource\u2019s Responsibility for ECRS and RRS and the telemetered additional capacity between the net power consumption and the Low Power Consumption (LPC).  If a Load Resource has responded to an actual ERCOT Dispatch Instruction in compliance with (a) and (b) above in the rolling 365-day period, ERCOT will use that response in lieu of a Load interruption test.  If a Load Resource has not responded to an ERCOT Dispatch Instruction in compliance with (a) and (b) above, either in a deployment event or a Load interruption test, in any rolling 365-day period, it is subject to a Load interruption test by ERCOT.  QSEs may request to have individual Load Resources aggregated for the purposes of Load interruption tests.  All performance evaluations will apply on an individual Resource basis.\n(9)\tERCOT may revoke the Ancillary Service qualification of any Load Resource, excluding CLRs, for failure to comply with the required performance standards, based on the evaluation it performed under paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.1.4.2, Responsive Reserve Service Energy Deployment Criteria, or under paragraph (1)(b) of Section 8.1.1.4.4, ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service Energy Deployment.  Specifically, if a Load Resource that is providing RRS or ECRS fails to respond with at least 95% of its Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility for RRS or ECRS within ten minutes of an ERCOT Dispatch Instruction, that response shall be considered a failure.  Two Load Resource performance failures, either in a deployment event or a Load interruption test, within any rolling 365-day period shall result in disqualification of that Load Resource.  After six months of disqualification, the Load Resource may reapply for qualification provided it submits a corrective action plan to ERCOT that identifies actions taken to correct performance deficiencies and the disqualified Load Resource successfully passes a new Load interruption test as specified in this Section 8.1.1.1.\n(10)\tTo maintain qualification with ERCOT to provide RRS from Fast Frequency Response (FFR), each Resource will be subject to an FFR qualification test at a date and time determined by ERCOT and known only to ERCOT and the affected TSP as applicable, to verify the ability to respond to an ERCOT Dispatch Instruction.  To successfully pass this test, within ten minutes of the receipt of the ERCOT Dispatch Instruction by the Resource\u2019s QSE, the Resource\u2019s response shall not be less than 95% of the requested MW deployment, nor more than 105% of the lesser of the following:\n(a)\tThe Resource\u2019s Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility for RRS; or\n(b)\tThe MW deployment.\nThe requested MW deployment for Resources capable of FFR will be the sum of the Resource\u2019s Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility for RRS and the additional capacity between the telemetered High Sustained Limit (HSL) and the telemetered Low Sustained Limit (LSL).  If a Resource has responded to an actual event in compliance with items (a) and (b) above in the rolling 365-day period, ERCOT will use that response in lieu of an FFR test.  If a Resource has not responded to an ERCOT Dispatch Instruction in compliance with items (a) and (b) above, in either a deployment event or an FFR test, in any rolling 365-day period, it is subject to an FFR test by ERCOT.  All performance evaluations will apply on an individual Resource basis.\n(11)\tERCOT may revoke the Ancillary Service qualification of any Resource providing FFR if that Resource has two Resource performance failures, either in a manual deployment event or a frequency triggered event, within any rolling 365-day period.  A performance failure is defined as a response less than 95% or more than 105% of the Resource\u2019s Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility for RRS within 15 cycles of a triggering event or within ten minutes of an ERCOT Dispatch Instruction.  This shall result in disqualification of that Resource.  After six months of disqualification, a Resource may reapply for qualification provided it submits a corrective action plan to ERCOT that identifies actions taken to correct performance deficiencies and the disqualified Resource successfully passes a new test as specified in Section 8.1.1.2.1.2, Responsive Reserve Qualification.\n[NPRR963, NPRR1011, and NPRR1188:  Replace applicable portions of Section 8.1.1.1 above with the following upon system implementation for NPRR963 or NPRR1188; or upon system implementation of Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project for NPRR1011:]\n8.1.1.1\tAncillary Service Qualification and Testing\n(1)\tEach QSE and the Resource providing Ancillary Service must meet qualification criteria to operate satisfactorily with ERCOT.

ERCOT shall provide an appropriate form for QSEs to submit their Seasonal HSL data.  The Seasonal HSL form shall take into account auxiliary Load and gross and net real power capability of the Generation Resource.  Each QSE shall update its COP and telemetry, as necessary, to reflect the HSL of each of its Generation Resources in a given operating interval as well as other operational limitations.  The HSL shown in the COP for a Generation Resource may not be ramp rate-limited while the Real-Time telemetered value of HSL for the Generation Resource may be ramp rate-limited by the QSE representing the Generation Resource in order for the Generation Resource to meet its HSL using the testing process described in paragraph (2) below. \n(2)\tTo verify that the HSL reported by telemetry is achievable, ERCOT may, at its discretion, conduct an unannounced Generation Resource test.  At a time determined solely by ERCOT, ERCOT will issue a Verbal Dispatch Instruction (VDI) to the QSE to operate the designated Generation Resource at its HSL as shown in the QSE\u2019s telemetry at the time the test is initiated.  The QSE shall immediately upon receiving the VDI release all Ancillary Service Obligations carried by the unit to be tested and shall telemeter Resource Status as \u201cONTEST.\u201d  The QSE shall not be required to start the designated Generation Resource if it is not already On-Line when ERCOT announces its intent to test the Resource.  If the designated Generation Resource is operating at its LSL when ERCOT sends the VDI to begin the test, the QSE shall have up to 60 minutes to allow the Resource to reach 90% of its HSL as shown by telemetry and up to an additional 20 minutes for the Resource to reach the HSL shown by telemetry at the time the test is initiated.  This time requirement does not apply to nuclear-fueled Generation Resources.  If the designated Generation Resource is operating between its LSL and 50% of its HSL shown by telemetry when ERCOT begins the test, the QSE shall have 60 minutes for the Resource to reach its HSL.  If the Resource is operating at or above 50% of its HSL shown by telemetry when ERCOT begins the test, the QSE shall have 30 minutes for the Resource to reach its HSL.  Once the designated Generation Resource reaches its HSL, the QSE shall hold it at that output level for a minimum of 30 minutes.  The HSL for the designated Generation Resource shall be determined based on the Real-Time averaged MW telemetered by the Resource during the 30 minutes of constant output.  After each test, the QSE representing the Generation Resource will complete and submit the test form using the Net Dependable Capability and Reactive Capability (NDCRC) application located on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area within two Business Days.\n[NPRR1011:  Replace paragraph (2) above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]\n(2)\tTo verify that the HSL reported by telemetry is achievable, ERCOT may, at its discretion, conduct an unannounced Generation Resource test.  At a time determined solely by ERCOT, ERCOT will issue a Verbal Dispatch Instruction (VDI) to the QSE to operate the designated Generation Resource at its HSL as shown in the QSE\u2019s telemetry at the time the test is initiated.  Immediately upon receiving the VDI, the QSE shall telemeter Resource Status as \u201cONTEST.\u201d  The QSE shall not be required to start the designated Generation Resource if it is not already On-Line when ERCOT announces its intent to test the Resource.  If the designated Generation Resource is operating at its LSL when ERCOT sends the VDI to begin the test, the QSE shall have up to 60 minutes to allow the Resource to reach 90% of its HSL as shown by telemetry and up to an additional 20 minutes for the Resource to reach the HSL shown by telemetry at the time the test is initiated.

The HSL for the designated Generation Resource shall be determined based on the Real-Time averaged MW telemetered by the Resource during the 30 minutes of constant output.  After each test, the QSE representing the Generation Resource will complete and submit the test form using the Net Dependable Capability and Reactive Capability (NDCRC) application located on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area within two Business Days.\n(3)\tERCOT may test multiple Generation Resources within a single QSE within a single 24-hour period.  However, in no case shall ERCOT test more than two Generation Resources within one QSE simultaneously.  All Resources On-Line in a Combined-Cycle Configuration will be measured on an aggregate capacity basis.  All QSEs associated with a jointly owned unit will be tested simultaneously.  Hydro, wind, and PhotoVoltaic (PV) generation will be excluded from unannounced generation capacity testing.  ERCOT shall not perform an unannounced Generation Resource test during a Watch or Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) event.  If an unannounced Generation Resource test is underway when a Watch or EEA event commences, ERCOT may cancel the test.\n(4)\tShould the designated Generation Resource fail to reach its HSL shown in its telemetry within the time frame set forth herein, the Real-Time averaged MW telemetered during the test shall be the basis for the new HSL for the designated Generation Resource for that Season.  The QSE shall have the opportunity to request another test as quickly as possible (at a time determined by ERCOT) and may retest up to two times per month.  The QSE may also demonstrate an increased value of HSL by operating the Generation Resource at an Output Schedule for at least 30 minutes.  In order to raise an Output Schedule above the Seasonal HSL, the QSE may set the Resource telemetered HSL equal to its output temporarily for the purposes of the demonstration tests.  After either a retest or a demonstration test, the MW capability of the Generation Resource based on the average of the MW production telemetered during the test shall be the basis for the new HSL for the designated Generation Resource for that Season.  Any requested retest must take place within three Business Days after the request for retest.\n(5)\tThe telemetered value of HSL for the Generation Resource shall only be used for testing purposes as described in this Section or for system reliability calculations. \n(6)\tA Resource Entity owning a Generation Resource operating in the synchronous condenser fast response mode to provide RRS or ECRS shall evaluate the maximum capability of the Resource each Season. \n(7)\tERCOT shall maintain historical records of unannounced Generation Resource test results, using the information contained therein to adjust the Reserve Discount Factor (RDF) subject to the approval of the appropriate TAC subcommittee.  ERCOT shall report to the Reliability and Operations Subcommittee (ROS) annually or as requested by ROS the aggregated results of such unannounced testing (excluding retests), including, but not limited to, the number and total capacity of Resources tested, the percentage of Resources that met or exceeded their HSL reported by telemetry, the percentage that failed to meet their HSL reported by telemetry, and the total MW capacity shortfall of those Resources that failed to meet their HSL reported by telemetry.\n(8)\tQSEs who receive a VDI to operate the designated Generation Resource for an unannounced Generation Resource test may be considered for additional compensation under Section 6.6.9, Emergency Operations Settlement.  Any unannounced Generation Resource test VDI that ERCOT issues as a result of a QSE-requested retest will not be considered for additional compensation under Section 6.6.9.\n(9)\tAll unannounced Generation Resource test VDIs will be considered as an instructed deviation for compliance purposes.\n(10)\tBefore the start of each Season, a QSE shall provide ERCOT a list identifying each Controllable Load Resource that is expected to operate in a Season as a provider of Ancillary Service.  Prior to the beginning of each Season, QSEs shall identify the Controllable Load Resources to be tested during the Season and the specific week of the test if known.  Any Controllable Load Resource for which the QSE desires qualification to provide Ancillary Services shall have its Net Dependable Capability verified prior to providing Ancillary Services.\n(11)\tERCOT shall verify the telemetry attributes of each qualified Load Resource as follows:\n(a)\tERCOT shall annually verify the telemetry attributes of each Load Resource providing RRS or ECRS using a high-set under-frequency relay.  In addition, once every two years, any Load Resource qualified to provide RRS or ECRS using a high-set under-frequency relay shall test the correct operation of the under-frequency relay or the output from the solid-state switch, whichever applies.  However, if a Load Resource\u2019s performance has been verified through response to an actual event, the data from the event can be used to meet the annual telemetry verification requirement for that year and the biennial relay-testing requirement. \n(b)\tERCOT shall periodically validate the telemetry attributes of each Controllable Load Resource.  In the case of an Aggregate Load Resource (ALR), ERCOT will follow the validation procedures described in  Section 22, Attachment O, Requirements for Aggregate Load Resource Participation in the ERCOT Markets.  If a QSE fails to meet its telemetry validation requirements, ERCOT may suspend the QSE and/or the Controllable Load Resource from participation in the applicable services or markets.  If disqualified pursuant to this paragraph, a QSE or Controllable Load Resource may reestablish its qualification by submitting a corrective action plan to ERCOT that identifies actions taken to correct performance deficiencies and by successfully passing a new ERCOT telemetry validation test.  \n(12)\tTelemetry values of a Load Resource may be adjusted to reflect Distribution Losses, based on the ERCOT-forecasted Distribution Loss Factors (DLFs).  Load Resources may be adjusted for Distribution Losses using the same distribution loss code as assigned to the ESI ID.    \n(13)\tA specific Load Resource to be used for the first time to provide Regulation Service, RRS, ECRS, Non-Spin, or energy by following Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) Base Points, must be tested to ERCOT\u2019s reasonable satisfaction using actual Demand response as part of its qualification.  The test must take place at a time mutually selected by the QSE representing the Load Resource and ERCOT.  ERCOT shall make available its standard test document for Load Resource qualification required under this Section on the ERCOT website.\n(14)\tAny changes to a Load Resource including changes to its capability to provide Ancillary Service requires updates by the Load Resource to the registration information detailing the change.  For Non-Opt-In Entities (NOIEs) representing specific Load Resources that are located behind the NOIE Settlement Metering points, the NOIE shall provide an alternative unique descriptor of the qualified Load Resource for ERCOT\u2019s records.\n(15)\tQualification of a Resource, including a Load Resource, remains valid for that Resource in the event of a change of QSE for the Resource, provided that the new QSE demonstrates to ERCOT\u2019s reasonable satisfaction that the new QSE has adequate communications and control capability for the Resource.\n(16)\tFor purposes of qualifying Quick Start Generation Resources (QSGRs), ERCOT shall issue a unit-specific VDI for the MW amount that the QSE is requesting to qualify its QSGR to provide.  The QSE shall telemeter an ONTEST Resource Status.  The QSGR will only be qualified to provide an amount not to exceed the observed output at the end of a ten-minute test period. \n(17)\tERCOT may revoke the QSGR qualification of any QSGR for failure to comply with the following performance standard:\n(a)\tA QSGR, available for deployment by SCED, is deemed to have failed to start for the purpose of this performance measure if the QSGR fails to achieve at least 90% of the minimum ERCOT SCED Base Point, including zero Base Points, within ten minutes of the initial ERCOT SCED Base Point that dispatched the QSGR above zero MW output.\n(b)\tERCOT may revoke a QSGR\u2019s qualification if within a rolling 90-day period the number of QSGR failures to start, as determined by paragraph (a) above, exceeds the higher of three failures or 10% of the number of quick start mode startups made in response to SCED deployments.\n(18)\tIf disqualified pursuant to paragraph (17) above, a QSGR may reestablish its QSGR qualification by submitting a corrective action plan to ERCOT that identifies actions taken to correct performance deficiencies and by successfully passing a new ERCOT QSGR test.\n(19)\tIf an Energy Storage Resource (ESR) is telemetering a non-zero ECRS Ancillary Service Responsibility and/or non-zero Non-Spin Ancillary Service Responsibility, to verify that the Ancillary Service Responsibility reported by telemetry is achievable based on the state of charge the Resource is maintaining in Real-Time, ERCOT may, at its discretion, conduct an unannounced ECRS/Non-Spin capability test.  At a time determined solely by ERCOT, ERCOT will issue a VDI to the QSE to operate the designated ESR an output level that delivers the total state of charge the ESR was obligated to provide based on sum of the ECRS Ancillary Service Responsibility and Non-Spin Ancillary Service Responsibility as shown in the ESR\u2019s telemetry at the time the test is initiated.  The QSE shall immediately upon receiving the VDI release all Ancillary Service Obligations carried by the ESR to be tested and shall telemeter Resource Status as \u201cONTEST.\u201d  Once the designated ESR reaches the target output level, the QSE shall hold at that output level for a minimum duration required to verify ESR\u2019s state of charge capability to meet the ECRS Ancillary Service Responsibility and Non-Spin Ancillary Service Responsibility.  The two-hour and/or four-hour capability for the designated ESR shall be determined based on the Real-Time averaged MW telemetered by the Resource during the constant output (i.e., hold) phase of the test.

Alternatively, if ERCOT agrees, the transmission line may be connected to the Black Start Resource before starting, allowing the Resource to energize the line as it comes up to speed; \n(v)\tStable operation of the Black Start Resource (in both frequency and voltage) while supplying only its auxiliary Loads or external Loads for at least 30 minutes;\n(vi)\tThis test may be performed together with the Basic Starting Test in one 30-minute interval; and\n(vii)\tEach Black Start Resource must pass a Line-Energizing Test once every three years.\n(c)\tThe \u201cLoad-Carrying Test\u201d shall utilize the Load agreed to between ERCOT, TSP and the Black Start Resource.  Testing shall occur as conditions permit, at a time agreed on by the Black Start Resource, TSP or DSP, and ERCOT, and includes the following:\n(i)\tStable operation of the Black Start Resource (in both frequency and voltage) while supplying restoration power to Load that is not identified as auxiliary Load of the Resource and is allowed to be auxiliary Load of adjacent facilities; \n(ii)\tConducting a Basic Starting Test;\n(iii)\tConducting a Line-Energizing Test when required; \n(iv)\tUnder the direction of ERCOT or the TSP operator, the Black Start Resource shall demonstrate the Black Start Resource\u2019s capability to supply the required Load, while maintaining voltage and frequency for at least 30 minutes;\n(v)\tThis test may be performed together with the Basic Starting Test and Line-Energizing Test when required in one 30-minute interval; and\n(vi)\tQualification under the Load-Carrying Test is valid for four calendar years.\n(d)\t\u201cNext Start Resource Test\u201d:\n(i)\tThe ability of a Black Start Resource to start up the next start unit\u2019s largest required motor while continuing to remain stable and control voltage and frequency shall be tested.  This test shall be repeated when a new next start unit is selected;\n(ii)\tTo pass the test: \n(A)\tThe potential Black Start Resource must start the next start unit (as determined by ERCOT), or start the next start unit\u2019s largest required motor and satisfied the next start unit\u2019s minimum startup Load requirements; or \n(B)\tThe Resource Entity shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of ERCOT through simulation studies conducted by the Resource Entity or a qualified third party, that the potential Black Start Resource is capable of starting the next start unit\u2019s largest required motor while meeting the next start unit\u2019s minimum startup Load requirements.  \n(iii)\tPotential Black Start Resources may request from ERCOT the information detailed in paragraph (B) above of the next start unit prior to the satisfaction of this requirement.  ERCOT shall request this information from the designated next start unit.  Such data, if requested by ERCOT, shall be provided by the QSE or Resource Entity representing the next start unit to ERCOT within 30 days.  Such information shall be considered Protected Information by the requesting Resource Entity;\n(iv)\tIf a physical test is performed, the test shall commence with a Basic Starting Test, followed by a Line-Energizing Test when required and a Load-Carrying Test as a stand-alone test or part of the Next Start Resource Test;\n(v)\tIf a physical test is performed, the Black Start Resource must remain stable (in both voltage and frequency) and controlling voltage for 30 minutes;\n(vi)\tIf a physical test is performed, this test may be performed together with the Basic Starting Test, Line-Energizing Test when required, and Load-Carrying Test in one 30-minute interval; and\n(vii)\tEach Black Start Resource must pass the Next Start Resource Test once every four calendar years.\n(e)\tThe \u201cBSS Back-up Fuel Switching Test\u201d shall:\n(i)\tDemonstrate a Black Start Resource\u2019s ability to successfully switch to a BSS Back-up Fuel source;\n(ii)\tDemonstrate the ability of the Black Start Resource to start itself, or start from a normally open interconnection to another provider not inside the ERCOT interconnection, without support from the ERCOT System and while operating on the BSS Back-up Fuel source.  The Black Start Resource may start on its primary fuel source, if necessary, but must transition to the BSS Back-up Fuel source within the timeframe indicated in its proposal;\n(iii)\tDemonstrate the ability of the Black Start Resource to remain stable (in both frequency and voltage) while operating on BSS Back-up Fuel source and supplying only its own auxiliary Loads or Loads in the immediate area for at least ten minutes; and\n(iv)\tDemonstrate that there is a sufficient amount of BSS Back-up Fuel to satisfy the requirement in paragraph (10) of Section 3.14.2, Black Start.\n(f)\tThe BSS Back-up Fuel Switching Test will be conducted on odd numbered years and may, at ERCOT\u2019s discretion, also be:\n(i)\tPerformed as part of the Basic Starting Test while operating on BSS Back-up Fuel; or \n(ii)\tAs a stand-alone test.\n(4)\tEach qualified Black Start Resource shall perform a Black Start Resource Availability Test quarterly unless the Black Start Resource has successfully started and operated at LSL or higher for at least four consecutive Settlement Intervals during the quarter.  The Black Start Resource\u2019s cost to perform a Black Start Availability Test may be a component of the overall bid for BSS but ERCOT will not separately compensate QSEs representing Black Start Resources for such testing.  ERCOT, at its sole discretion, may grant an exemption of the Black Start Resource Availability Test for QSEs whose Black Start Resources have responded as instructed by ERCOT during an EEA event.\n(5)\tThe Black Start Resource Availability Test shall be scheduled by ERCOT.  Upon receipt of notification for a Black Start Resource Availability Test, the QSE representing the Black Start Resource shall send confirmation to ERCOT of its intent to comply with the test or submit a request to reschedule along with justification for the request.\n(6)\tERCOT shall provide the QSE representing the Black Start Resource two-hour notice in order to allow the QSE time to update its COP.  The QSE representing the Black Start Resource shall show the Resource as \u201cONTEST\u201d in its COP and through its Real-Time telemetry for the duration of the test.  As part of the Black Start Resource Availability Test, the QSE representing the Black Start Resource shall start the Black Start Resource and operate it at or above its LSL for at least four consecutive Settlement Intervals.  After completion of the Black Start Resource Availability Test the QSE will update its COP to reflect their current status.\n(7)\tUpon completion of the Black Start Resource Availability Test, the QSE representing the Black Start Resource shall complete and file a Black Start Resource Availability Test report with ERCOT.  If the Black Start Resource wants to use a successful start and normal operation to satisfy the quarterly reporting requirement, it must provide the necessary information for the start and normal operation on a Black Start Resource Availability Test report.  The report form shall be provided by ERCOT.\n(8)\tA Black Start Resource Availability Test is deemed to be successful if the Black Start Resource comes On-Line within the time specified in the Black Start Resource\u2019s Request for Proposal response submitted to ERCOT and operates at a minimum level as agreed to by ERCOT and the QSE representing the Black Start Resource for at least four consecutive Settlement Intervals.\n(9)\tIf the Black Start Resource fails to successfully start during the Black Start Resource Availability Test, the QSE representing the Black Start Resource shall immediately update its Availability Plan for that Black Start Resource showing zero availability.  The QSE representing the Black Start Resource shall not receive the Hourly Standby Fee for BSS effective from the date of the failed Black Start Resource Availability Test.  The QSE representing the Black Start Resource may schedule a second Black Start Resource Availability Test, subject to ERCOT approval, to be completed within ten Business Days of the date of the failed Black Start Resource Availability Test unless a later date is agreed to by ERCOT.  The cost of the second Black Start Resource test will be borne solely by the QSE representing the Black Start Resource. \n(10)\tIf the Black Start Resource successfully passes the second Black Start Resource Availability Test, the QSE representing the Black Start Resource shall resume receipt of the Hourly Standby Fee beginning on the date of the successful Black Start Resource Availability Test.\n(11)\tIf the Black Start Resource fails a second Black Start Resource Availability Test within the quarter, it shall immediately be disqualified from providing BSS and shall receive no further compensation under the Black Start Service Agreement.  In addition, ERCOT shall claw-back all Hourly Standby Fee payments made to the QSE representing the Black Start Resource since its last successful Black Start Resource Availability Test or its last successful start and operation under normal system conditions, whichever is later.  The clawed-back Hourly Standby Fee payments shall be uplifted by ERCOT to Loads on a Load Ratio Share (LRS) basis.  ERCOT may, at its sole discretion, consider allowing the Black Start Resource to perform an additional Black Start Resource Availability Test.  ERCOT may also, at its sole discretion, seek to procure additional Black Start Resources to replace the disqualified Black Start Resource.\n(12)\tA QSE representing the Black Start Resource shall update its Availability Plan for a Black Start Resource to show zero if the Black Start Resource fails to perform when ERCOT has issued a Dispatch Instruction to come On-Line any time other than for a Blackout.  The Black Start Resource shall continue to be shown as unavailable until it successfully starts under normal operations or completes a successful Black Start Resource Availability Test.\n(13)\tIf the Black Start Resource fails to perform successfully during an actual Blackout and the Black Start Resource has been declared available, as defined in Section 22, Attachment D, ERCOT shall:\n(a)\tDecertify the Black Start Resource for the remainder of the Black Start Agreement contract term; and\n(b)\tClaw-back 100% of the Hourly Standby Fee paid to the QSE representing the Black Start Resource for all the Operating Days since its last successful Black Start Resource Availability Test or its last successful start and operation under normal system conditions, whichever is later. \n8.1.1.2.1.6\tFirm Fuel Supply Service Resource Qualification, Testing, Decertification, and Recertification\n(1)\tGeneration Resources that meet the following requirements are eligible to provide Firm Fuel Supply Service (FFSS) and may be selected in the procurement process for FFSS.  Both the primary Generation Resource and any alternate Generation Resources, as specified in the FFSS Offer Submission Form, must meet the following requirements prior to submitting an FFSS Offer Submission Form:\n(a)\tSuccessfully demonstrates dual fuel capability, the ability to establish and burn an alternative onsite stored fuel, and has onsite fuel storage capability in an amount that satisfies the minimum FFSS capability requirements, as described in paragraph (2) below;\n(b)\tHas an onsite natural gas or fuel oil storage capability or off-site natural gas storage where the Resource Entity and/or QSE owns and controls the natural gas storage and pipeline to deliver the required amount of reserve natural gas to the Generation Resource from the storage facility in an amount that satisfies the minimum FFSS capability requirements, as defined in paragraph (2) below; or\n(c)\tMeets the following requirements:  \n(i)\tThe Generation Entity for the Generation Resource (or an Affiliate of such Generation Entity) either owns a storage facility with, or has a Firm Gas Storage Agreement for, sufficient natural gas storage capacity for the offered Generation Resource to deliver the offered MW for the duration requirement specified in the request for proposal (RFP); \n(ii)\tThe Generation Entity for the Generation Resource (or an Affiliate of such Generation Entity) must own and have good title to sufficient natural gas in the storage facility for the offered Generation Resource to deliver the offered MW for at least the duration requirement specified in the RFP, and must commit to maintain such quantity of natural gas in storage at all times during the obligation period; and\n(iii)\tThe Generation Entity for the Generation Resource (or an Affiliate of such Generation Entity) must have entered into a Firm Transportation Agreement on an FFSS Qualifying Pipeline, or multiple Firm Transportation Agreements on multiple Qualifying Pipelines, and: \n(A)\tEach Firm Transportation Agreement must have a maximum daily contract quantity sufficient to transport the quantity of natural gas described above from the storage facility to the Generation Resource in a quantity that is sufficient to allow generation of the offered FFSS MW for at least the duration requirement specified in the RFP;\n(B)\tAt least one of the Firm Transportation Agreements must contain a primary receipt point that is the point of withdrawal for the storage facility used to comply with paragraph (i) above; \n(C)\tAt least one of the Firm Transportation Agreements must contain a primary delivery point that permits delivery of the natural gas directly to the Generation Resource (including through a plant line or other dedicated lateral);\n(D)\tEach Firm Transportation Agreement must have a term that includes each hour of November 15 through March 15, i.e., during the FFSS obligation period; and\n(E)\tIf multiple Firm Transportation Agreements will be used, the point of delivery for each Firm Transportation Agreement, other than the Firm Transportation Agreement that satisfies the requirements set forth in paragraph (C) above, must be a primary receipt point under another Firm Transportation Agreement such that there is a complete path for firm transportation service from the storage facility to the Generation Facility.\n(iv)\tIf the Generation Entity will utilize a contractual right to firm gas storage capacity on a third-party system under a Firm Gas Storage Agreement to comply with paragraph (i) above rather than a self-owned physical gas storage facility to qualify, then the Firm Gas Storage Agreement must have: \n(A)\tA term that includes each hour of November 15 through March 15, i.e., during the FFSS obligation period; \n(B)\tA maximum storage quantity not less than the amount of natural gas needed to allow the Generation Resource to deliver the offered MW for the duration requirement specified in the RFP;\n(C)\tA maximum daily withdrawal quantity that permits the Generation Entity (or an Affiliate) to withdraw from storage a daily quantity of natural gas sufficient to allow the Generation Resource to deliver the offered MW for the duration requirement specified in the RFP; and\n(D)\tA point of withdrawal that is a primary receipt point under its Firm Transportation Agreement.\n(v)\tIf the Generation Entity will utilize storage owned by it or an Affiliate to comply with paragraph (i) above, then the Generation Entity must certify that for the entire obligation period it or its Affiliate, as applicable, retains the rights to: \n(A)\tSufficient storage capacity in its facility to store not less than the amount of natural gas needed to allow the Generation Resource to deliver the offered MW for the duration requirement specified in the RFP;  \n(B)\tWithdraw from its storage a daily quantity of natural gas sufficient to allow the Generation Resource to deliver the offered MW for the duration requirement specified in the RFP; and\n(C)\tWithdraw from its storage facility at a point of withdrawal that is a primary receipt point under its Firm Transportation Agreement.\n(vi)\tThe MW offered by the QSE for the Generation Resource may not be less than the Generation Resource\u2019s LSL.\n(vii)\tThe Generation Entity for the Generation Resource may satisfy the requirements set forth in paragraphs (i) through (v) above through use of a single, bundled agreement providing for gas supply, storage, and transportation service, as long as the bundled agreement satisfies the requirements of the definitions of Firm Transportation Agreement and Firm Gas Storage Agreement, the requirements in paragraphs (ii), (iii)(A), (iii)(D), (iv)(A), (iv)(B), and (iv)(C) above, and has a primary delivery point that permits delivery of the gas directly to the Generation Resource (including through a plant line or other dedicated lateral).\n(d)\tA Generation Resource may participate as a Firm Fuel Supply Service Resource (FFSSR) under only one of paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) above.\n(e)\tSuccessfully demonstrates the ability to provide FFSS in order to maintain Resource availability in the event of a natural gas curtailment or other fuel supply disruption consistent with qualifying technologies identified by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT).\n(2)\tThe minimum FFSS capability requirement is the volume of fuel necessary to operate the Generation Resource at the FFSS MW award level for the duration requirement specified in the RFP.  This MW value must be greater than or equal to the Generation Resource\u2019s LSL and is a limit on the MW quantity of FFSS that can be offered for the Generation Resource in the FFSS Offer Submission Form.  \n(3)\tA Generation Resource will not be considered qualified to provide FFSS if, in a prior obligation period, the Generation Resource was decertified per paragraph (18) below.  However, such Generation Resource may nevertheless be considered qualified to provide FFSS if the Generation Resource: \n(a)\tHas subsequently been recertified, as provided in paragraph (22) below; or \n(b)\tThe QSE representing the Generation Resource submits a corrective action plan to ERCOT and has agreement with ERCOT on that plan.\n(4)\tA Generation Entity may, but is not required to, submit in writing a proposed form of Firm Gas Storage Agreement or Firm Transportation Agreement (whether to be entered into by the Generation Entity or an Affiliate thereof) to ERCOT for review to be certified as an FFSS Qualified Contract in accordance with such policies and procedures as ERCOT may develop or require from time to time consistent with the requirements of the ERCOT Protocols.\n(a)\tERCOT may, but is not obligated to, undertake a review of such agreement and, if acceptable, certify in writing such agreement as an FFSS Qualified Contract.  The decision whether to certify such agreement as an FFSS Qualified Contract shall be in ERCOT\u2019s sole discretion.\n(b)\tTo the extent that any such agreement is so certified by ERCOT, it shall constitute an FFSS Qualified Contract, and a Generation Entity may rely upon such certification for purposes of qualifying as an FFSSR under paragraph (1)(c) above.  Any material change to the ERCOT certified form of an existing FFSS Qualified Contract that affects the requirements of a firm natural gas FFSSR shall require a re-certification by ERCOT.  For the avoidance of doubt, a Firm Gas Storage Agreement or Firm Transportation Agreement meeting the requirements of the natural gas FFSSR is not required to be certified as an FFSS Qualified Contract.\n(5)\tA QSE representing a Generation Resource that will be offered to provide FFSS as a primary Generation Resource or an alternate Generation Resource must annually demonstrate each offered Generation Resource\u2019s capability to use reserved fuel sources identified in paragraphs (1)(a) through (1)(c) above and sustain its output for 60 minutes at the MW value equal to the QSE\u2019s desired level of FFSS qualification for the Resource.  The maximum MW of FFSS that can be offered for the designated Resource by the QSE must be limited to the average Real-Time net real power (in MW) telemetered for the Resource during the demonstration period.  Each QSE representing an FFSSR or prospective FFSSR must annually complete the test or successfully deploy at the maximum awarded MW amount for at least the demonstration period and inform ERCOT by August 15 of each year.  In order to complete this annual process, the QSE representing the Generation Resource(s) shall:\n(a)\tIf qualifying by a self-test, coordinate the test with the ERCOT control room and show the Resource as having a Resource Status of \u201cONTEST\u201d in its COP and through its Real-Time telemetry for the duration of the demonstration; and\n(b)\tSubmit a Resource FFSS qualification form with the date and time of the self-test or the successful deployment that the QSE would like considered for qualification.\n(6)\tA QSE representing an FFSSR must ensure the full awarded FFSS capability is available by November 15 of each year awarded in the RFP.\n(7)\tA QSE representing an FFSSR shall update the Availability Plan for a Generation Resource to show it is unavailable to provide FFSS if it is not available to come On-Line or generate using reserved fuel.  The QSE representing an FFSSR must submit an Availability Plan for any alternate Generation Resource that were designated in the FFSS Offer Submission Form.  The QSE shall continue to show the Generation Resource is unavailable to provide FFSS in the Availability Plan until it can successfully come On-Line or generate using the reserved fuel.\n(8)\tAn FFSSR that is not available to come On-Line shall inform the ERCOT control room as soon as practicable and update the FFSSR Availability Plan within 60 minutes of identifying the unavailability.\n(9)\tIf the FFSSR is not available for the hours for which ERCOT has issued a Watch for winter weather, ERCOT shall claw back and/or withhold the FFSS Hourly Standby Fee for 90 days, unless the FFSSR exhausted the fuel reserved to generate at the FFSS MW award level for the duration requirement specified in the RFP, including any fuel that was restocked following final approval or instruction from ERCOT, or the FFSSR exhausted emission hours allocated for the FFSSR, as specified in the FFSS Offer Submission Form.  Evidence of an FFSSR not being available includes, but is not limited to, an Availability Plan submission of unavailable or other communications to the ERCOT control room indicating the FFSSR is not available during the Watch.\n(10)\tIf the FFSSR fails to come On-Line or stay On-Line during an FFSS deployment due to a fuel-related issue, ERCOT shall claw back and/or withhold the FFSS Hourly Standby Fee for 90 days.  A QSE representing an FFSSR may coordinate with ERCOT and seek approval to take the FFSSR Off-Line for no more than four hours to perform critical maintenance associated with consuming the reserved fuel.  If the QSE coordinates with ERCOT and receives approval to take the FFSSR unit Off-Line and brings the FFSSR back On-Line within four hours or less, this shall not count as failure to stay On-Line for the purpose of this paragraph.\n(11)\tIf the FFSSR comes On-Line or continues generating using reserved fuel during an FFSS deployment, but fails to telemeter on average an HSL equal to or greater than 95% of the awarded FFSS MW value due to a fuel-related issue, ERCOT shall claw back and/or withhold the FFSS Hourly Standby Fee for 90 days, in proportion to the difference between the awarded MW value and the average telemetered HSL over the FFSS deployment period.\n(12)\tIf the FFSSR comes On-Line or continues generating using reserved fuel during an FFSS deployment but fails to generate on average at the minimum of either 95% of the MW level instructed by ERCOT or 95% of the awarded FFSS MW value due to a fuel-related issue, ERCOT shall claw back and/or withhold the FFSS Hourly Standby Fee for 90 days, in proportion to the difference between the average MW level instructed by ERCOT over the FFSS deployment period and the corresponding average generation of the FFSSR.\n(13)\tIf the FFSSR fails to come On-Line or stay On-Line during an FFSS deployment due to a non-fuel related issue, ERCOT shall claw back and/or withhold the FFSS Hourly Standby Fee for 15 days. \n(14)\tIf the FFSSR comes On-Line or continues generating using reserved fuel during an FFSS deployment but fails to telemeter on average an HSL equal to or greater than 95% of the awarded FFSS MW value due to a non-fuel related issue, ERCOT shall claw back and/or withhold the FFSS Hourly Standby Fee for 15 days, in proportion to the difference between the awarded MW value and the average telemetered HSL over the FFSS deployment period.\n(15)\tIf the FFSSR comes On-Line or continues generating using reserved fuel during an FFSS deployment but fails to generate on average at the minimum of either 95% of the MW level instructed by ERCOT or 95% of the awarded FFSS MW value due to a non-fuel related issue, ERCOT shall claw back and/or withhold the FFSS Hourly Standby Fee for 15 days, in proportion to the difference between the average MW level instructed by ERCOT over the FFSS deployment period and the corresponding average generation of the FFSSR.\n(16)\tNotwithstanding paragraphs (9) through (15) above, if the FFSSR is otherwise available but fails to come On-Line or is forced Off-Line due to a transmission system outage or transmission system limitation that would prevent the unit from being deployed to LSL, ERCOT shall not claw back the FFSS Hourly Standby Fee.  \n(17)\tIf conditions described in paragraphs (11) and (12) occur for the same deployment period, ERCOT shall only claw back the larger amount calculated in paragraph (11) or (12).  If conditions described in paragraphs (14) and (15) occur for the same deployment period, ERCOT shall only claw back the larger amount calculated in paragraph (14) or (15).\n(18)\tERCOT shall decertify a primary Generation Resource or any alternate Generation Resource that was an FFSSR for any of the following:\n(a)\tFailure to come On-Line or stay On-Line during an FFSS deployment due to a fuel-related issue for two or more deployments;\n(b)\tIf the FFSSR comes On-Line or continues generating using reserved fuel during an FFSS deployment, failure to generate on average at the minimum of either 95% of the MW level instructed by ERCOT or 95% of the awarded FFSS MW value due to a fuel-related issue for two or more deployments; or\n(c)\tFailure to maintain an Hourly Rolling Equivalent Availability Factor greater than or equal to 50%.\n(19)\tIf ERCOT decertifies a primary Generation Resource, the QSE shall designate an alternate Generation Resource that was awarded through the FFSS procurement process to replace the decertified Generation Resource and continue to provide FFSS.  The designated alternate Generation Resource shall satisfy all of the requirements in paragraph (9) of Section 3.14.5, Firm Fuel Supply Service.  The designated alternate Generation Resource may no longer be an alternate for another primary Generation Resource.\n(20)\tIf ERCOT decertifies an FFSSR that does not have any alternate Generation Resources that were awarded through the FFSS procurement process, ERCOT will cease payments to the QSE under Section 6.6.14.2, Firm Fuel Supply Service Hourly Standby Fee Payment and Fuel Replacement Cost Recovery, until the FFSSR is recertified by ERCOT.  ERCOT may issue one or more RFPs to replace the decertified FFSSR\u2019s capacity for the remainder of the FFSS obligation period.  \n(21)\tIf ERCOT has not replaced a decertified Generation Resource\u2019s FFSSR capacity, the QSE of a decertified Generation Resource may request to reestablish its FFSSR certification by submitting a corrective action plan to ERCOT that identifies actions taken to correct performance deficiencies and by successfully passing a new test, as described in paragraph (5) above.  ERCOT shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether a Generation Resource shall be recertified.\n(22)\tA decertified Generation Resource that has not been recertified by ERCOT must submit a corrective action plan to ERCOT and have agreement with ERCOT on that plan in order to be considered qualified to provide FFSS and be selected in the procurement process for any future FFSS obligation period.\n(23)\tIf an FFSSR is unavailable or fails to continuously deploy due to a Force Majeure Event, the Generation Entity for such Generation Resource must provide a report to ERCOT containing certain additional information, including:\n(a)\tIf the basis of the non-performance is a Force Majeure Event affecting the FFSSR, a description of the Force Majeure Event giving rise to the non-performance, with reasonably full details of such Force Majeure Event;\n(b)\tIf the basis of the non-performance is the unavailability of the FFSSR\u2019s FFSS Qualifying Pipeline or natural gas storage facility:\n(i)\tA copy of the relevant Firm Transportation Agreement and/or Firm Gas Storage Agreement; \n(ii)\tA copy of the nominations submitted or a detailed accounting of no notices volumes delivered for the gas day prior to the Force Majeure Event until the gas day after the Force Majeure Event; \n(iii)\tThe applicable storage inventory level for the gas day prior to the Force Majeure Event until the gas day after the Force Majeure Event; \n(iv)\tA copy of the force majeure notice from the FFSS Qualifying Pipeline operator or storage provider; and\n(v)\tThe capacity and flow data from the FFSS Qualifying Pipeline or storage facility for the gas day prior to the Force Majeure Event until the gas day after the Force Majeure Event;\n(c)\tTo the best of its knowledge, how, why, and to what extent the Force Majeure Event actually and directly affected the FFSSR\u2019s ability to perform;\n(d)\tThe FFSSR\u2019s heat rate;\n(e)\tThe applicable nominations, and if applicable, no-notice delivered, on the FFSS Qualifying Pipeline from the gas day prior to the Force Majeure Event until the day after the Force Majeure Event; and\n(f)\tERCOT will have the right to request that the Generation Entity provide, or cause to be provided, any additional information ERCOT deems necessary, and the Generation Entity must provide such requested information to the extent reasonably within its possession or control.  If the information is not in the possession of the Generation Entity (or its Affiliate) but may be in the possession of the FFSS Qualifying Pipeline operator or storage provider, the Generation Entity will exercise any contractual rights it has to request such information from the FFSS Qualifying Pipeline operator or storage provider, as applicable.\n(24)\tUnless the agreement is a certified contract, if the relevant Firm Transportation Agreement and/or Firm Gas Storage Agreement does not ensure firmness in the manner required by the ERCOT Protocols, ERCOT shall revoke the award and claw back and/or withhold all of the FFSS Hourly Standby Fees for all of the days of the obligation period.\n(25)\tFor an FFSSR, a Force Majeure Event will be treated the same as any other cause for unavailability for the purposes of calculating the FFSSR\u2019s FFSS Hourly Rolling Equivalent Availability Factor and for paragraphs (9) through (15) above.\n(26)\tIt will constitute a material change under the ERCOT Protocols if a primary Generation Resource or any alternate Generation Resource that qualified to provide FFSS under paragraph (1)(c) above ceases to satisfy any of the requirements to qualify as an FFSSR under paragraph (1)(c) above (for example, but not limited to, if the Firm Transportation Agreement is terminated or if the FFSS Qualifying Pipeline no longer qualifies as an FFSS Qualifying Pipeline). \n(a)\tThe QSE of such Generation Resource will be required to notify ERCOT within two Business Days of such a material change.\n(b)\tERCOT may decertify a primary Generation Resource or alternate Generation Resource if such material change is, in ERCOT\u2019s sole opinion, an adverse change (for example, but not limited to, if a Firm Transportation Agreement is terminated and not replaced with a comparable, qualifying Firm Transportation Agreement).\n8.1.1.2.1.7\tERCOT Contingency Reserve Service Qualification\n(1)\tECRS may be provided by:  \n(a)\tUnloaded Generation Resources that are On-Line; \n(b)\tQuick Start Generation Resources (QSGRs); \n(c)\tLoad Resources that may or may not be controlled by high-set under-frequency relays; \n(d)\tGeneration Resources operating in the synchronous condenser fast-response mode; or \n(e)\tControllable Load Resources (CLRs). \n(2)\tThe amount of ECRS provided by individual Generation Resources and Load Resources is limited to ten times its telemetered emergency ramp rate.  Each Resource providing ECRS must be capable of ramping the Resource\u2019s Ancillary Service Resources Responsibility for ECRS within ten minutes of the notice to deploy ECRS,  and must be able to maintain the scheduled level of deployment for the period of service commitment.  The amount of ECRS on a Generation Resource may be further limited by requirements of the Operating Guides.\n(3)\tA Load Resource must be loaded and capable of unloading the scheduled amount of ECRS within ten minutes of instruction by ERCOT and must either be immediately responsive to system frequency or be interrupted by action of under-frequency relays with settings as specified by the Operating Guides.\n(4)\tAny QSE providing ECRS shall provide communications equipment to receive ERCOT telemetered control deployments of ECRS.\n(5)\tLoad Resources providing ECRS must provide a telemetered output signal, including breaker status and status of the under-frequency relay, if applicable. \n(6)\tEach QSE shall ensure that each Resource is able to meet the Resource\u2019s obligations to provide the Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility.  Each Generation Resource and Load Resource providing ECRS must meet additional technical requirements specified in this Section.\n(7)\tA qualification test for each Resource to provide ECRS is conducted during a continuous eight-hour period agreed to by the QSE and ERCOT.  ERCOT shall confirm the date and time of the test with the QSE.  ERCOT shall administer the following test requirements:\n(a)\tAt any time during the window (selected by ERCOT when market and reliability conditions allow and not previously disclosed to the QSE), ERCOT shall notify the QSE it is to provide an amount of ECRS from its Resource to be qualified equal to the amount that the QSE is requesting qualification.  The QSE shall acknowledge the start of the test.\n(b)\tFor Generation Resources desiring qualification to provide ECRS, ERCOT shall send a signal to the Resource\u2019s QSE to deploy ECRS, indicating the MW amount.  ERCOT shall monitor the QSEs telemetry of the Resource\u2019s Ancillary Service Schedule for an update within 15 seconds.  ERCOT shall measure the test Resource\u2019s response as described under Section 8.1.1.4.4, ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service Energy Deployment Criteria.

The performance evaluation has three purposes:\n(a)\tTo provide the QSE a basis for determining the ERS Resource\u2019s offer capacity; \n(b)\tTo provide the basis for ERCOT to determine the ERS Resource\u2019s availability during its committed hours in an ERS Contract Period; and \n(c)\tTo measure and verify the ERS Resource\u2019s performance, as compared to its contracted capacity, during an ERS deployment event or test.\n8.1.3.1.1\tBaselines for Emergency Response Service Loads\n(1)\tAs part of the ERS procurement process, ERCOT shall notify QSEs of an ERS Load\u2019s eligibility to be evaluated on one or more of the following baselines, which are developed and administered by ERCOT consistent with the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) Practice Standards:\n(a)\tThe \u201cERS Default Baseline\u201d requires an ERS Load to reduce its Load by its contracted amount, and is a method of estimating the electricity that would have been consumed by an ERS Load in the absence of an ERS deployment event;\n(b)\tThe \u201cERS Alternate Baseline\u201d requires an ERS Load to reduce Load to a contracted level of electricity Demand (its maximum base load) in an ERS deployment event. \n(2)\tERS Default Baseline:\n(a)\tAs part of its Resource identification process, ERCOT will determine if each ERS Load can qualify under a default baseline methodology.  A default baseline methodology is designed to predict the interval Load based on variables which may include historic Load data, weather, time of day and other relevant calendar information.  ERCOT may use other data variables in a default baseline methodology at ERCOT\u2019s sole discretion, if ERCOT determines the additional data will enhance the accuracy of the default baseline.  Development of a default baseline for each ERS Load will be consistent with practices described in the document entitled \u201cDemand Response Baseline Methodologies\u201d posted on the ERCOT website.  \n(b)\tFor aggregated ERS Loads, ERCOT may develop either a single baseline model at the aggregate level or multiple baseline models for individual sites and/or subsets of sites within the aggregation.  If ERCOT develops the model at the site and/or subset level, ERCOT shall establish the default baseline for the aggregated ERS Load by summing the baselines of the individual sites and/or subsets of sites in the aggregation.  ERCOT shall verify the performance at the ERS Load level.\n(c)\tERCOT will develop a default baseline for an ERS Load by analyzing historic 15-minute interval usage data.\n(d)\tIf ERCOT determines that an ERS Load qualifies for a default baseline, ERCOT shall provide default baseline analysis results for the ERS Load to the QSE representing that ERS Resource.\n(3)\tERS Alternate Baseline:\n(a)\tERCOT may assign an ERS Load to an alternate baseline formula for one of the following reasons:\n(i)\tERCOT determines that the ERS Load does not have sufficient predictability for a default baseline;\n(ii)\tThe QSE requests an alternate baseline for the ERS Load; or\n(iii)\tERCOT has insufficient historical meter data available at the time of baseline evaluation to accurately model the ERS Load.\n(b)\tIf, following ERS procurement, ERCOT determines that sufficient historical data is available and the ERS Load has sufficient predictability for a default baseline, ERCOT with the QSE\u2019s consent may reassign the ERS Load to a default baseline, notify the QSE of the reassignment, and calculate performance for the ERS Contract Period accordingly.  \n(c)\tUnder the alternate baseline formula, ERCOT shall calculate an ERS Load\u2019s average (mean) Load (MWh) over the most recent available 12-month period, with an emphasis on the months corresponding to the upcoming ERS Standard Contract Term.  ERCOT will validate the MW capacity offer for each ERS Load for the applicable ERS Time Period, based upon the difference between this average Load calculation (MWh) and the ERS Load\u2019s declared maximum base Load (MWh).  In selecting an ERS Load with an alternate baseline, ERCOT may award the lesser of the MW offer or the MW capacity validated by ERCOT.  \n(4)\tERS Weather-Sensitive Load:\n(a)\tERCOT shall assign a residential Weather-Sensitive ERS Load to either the regression baseline performance evaluation methodology or the control group baseline performance evaluation methodology.  Both methodologies are described in the document entitled \u201cDemand Response Baseline Methodologies\u201d posted to the ERCOT website.  The control group baseline performance evaluation methodology shall only be available to ERS Loads consisting entirely of residential sites.\n(i)\tAt least nine months of interval data for all sites within an ERS Load are required for the Load to be eligible for the regression baseline evaluation methodology.  If one or more sites lack sufficient interval data, the ERS Load will either be evaluated using the control group baseline performance evaluation methodology or will be disqualified from participation as an ERS Load.\n(ii)\tSites in an ERS Load assigned to the control group baseline are required to have fully functional interval metering in place at the start of an ERS Standard Contract Term, but are not required to have historical meter data prior to that time.\n(iii)\tIf ERCOT determines that the residential ERS Load may be assigned to either baseline methodology, the QSE may select its preferred option.\n(b)\tIf the ERS Load consists of non-residential sites, the ERS Load must qualify for at least one ERS default baseline methodology, as described in paragraph (2) above.\n(c)\tFor an ERS Load assigned to the control group baseline, ERCOT will divide the aggregation into multiple randomly assigned numbered groups for purposes of testing and deployment event Dispatch, and one of these groups will be designated as the control group, to be held out of the test or event, at time of Dispatch.  All remaining ERS Loads will participate and be evaluated in each test or event relative to the control group.  ERCOT will strive to minimize control group size while preserving the ability to achieve accurate Demand response measurement and verification.  The number of groups, group size and group designations are subject to change if the QSE adjusts the population of the ERS Load during the ERS Standard Contract Term, as described in paragraph (15) of Section 3.14.3.1, Emergency Response Service Procurement.\n(5)\tAll ESI IDs within an aggregated ERS Load must be on the same baseline methodology (either the ERS Default Baseline, or the ERS Alternate Baseline). \n8.1.3.1.2\tPerformance Evaluation for Emergency Response Service Generators\n(1)\tERCOT shall evaluate the event performance of an ERS Generator by measuring net injection of energy to the ERCOT System using data from metering as described in paragraph (5)(a) of Section 3.14.3.3, Emergency Response Service Provision and Technical Requirements.\n(2)\tA Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS Load will be classified as co-located with an ERS Generator if each site in the ERS Load is physically located with a site in the ERS Generator, and if both the ERS Generator and the ERS Load are represented by the same QSE and are participating in the same ERS service type and Time Periods.  If separate offers are received from different QSEs, both offers will be rejected.  A Weather-Sensitive ERS Load is not eligible to be classified as co-located with an ERS Generator.\n(3)\tIf an ERS Generator is co-located with an ERS Load the following shall apply:\n(a)\tIf a default baseline has been selected by a QSE for ERS performance evaluation for an ERS Load that is co-located with an ERS Generator, event and test performance of the ERS Generator and ERS Load shall be evaluated jointly using interval data from the Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) installed metering. The joint performance will be attributed to both the ERS Load and ERS Generator.\n(b) \tThe self-serve capacity used to calculate availability in each ERS Time Period for the ERS Generator shall be deemed to be the lesser of the self-serve capacity specified on the offer or the peak Load of the ERS Load during that ERS Time Period over the 12 months preceding the beginning of the ERS Standard Contract Term.\n(c)\tIf the co-located ERS Load is assigned to the ERS Alternate Baseline, the performance during an ERS deployment event or ERCOT test shall be evaluated using one of two methods selected by the QSE:\n(i)\tThe QSE may elect to have the performance of the ERS Generator and ERS Load evaluated separately.  In this case:\n(A)\tAll site Load must participate in the ERS Load and ERCOT shall calculate interval-by-interval values for the Load of each site in the ERS Load by adding the MWh output measured by the QSE-installed metering on the generator(s) at the site to the MWh consumption measured by the TDSP metering and by subtracting the MWh export from the site, as measured by the TDSP metering.  The performance of the ERS Load shall be evaluated using the ERCOT calculated values of the site Load.\n(B)\tThe ERS Generator shall be evaluated using the interval data measured by the metering on the output of the generator(s) as required by paragraph (5)(a) of Section 3.14.3.3.  For purposes of determining ERS Generator performance, the injection capacity in each ERS Time Period for the ERS Generator shall be deemed to be the sum of self-serve capacity and injection capacity submitted on the offer for that ERS Time Period, and the self-serve capacity used to measure performance for that ERS Time Period shall be deemed to be zero. \n(ii)\tThe QSE may elect to have the performance of the ERS Generator and ERS Load evaluated jointly.  In this case, ERCOT shall use the TDSP metering installed for the performance evaluation.\n(A)\tIf ERCOT determines that one of its established default baseline types accurately represents the ERS Load\u2019s Demand response contribution, the contribution of the ERS Load to the joint performance shall be based on that response.\n(B)\tIf ERCOT determines that none of its established default baseline types accurately represents the ERS Load\u2019s Demand response contribution, the contribution of the ERS Load to the joint performance shall be deemed to be the product of the ERS Load\u2019s obligation for the interval and the ERS Interval Performance Factor (EIPFi) as computed in Section 8.1.3.1.4, Event Performance Criteria for Emergency Response Service Resources.\n(C)\tThe joint performance will be attributed to both the ERS Load and ERS Generator.\n(4)\tIf the ERS Generator is not co-located with an ERS Load the following shall apply:\n(a)\tFor purposes of determining ERS performance, the self-serve capacity used to measure performance in each time period for the ERS Generator shall be deemed to be zero and the injection capacity used to measure performance shall be equal to the amount submitted on the offer.\n(b)\tThe ERS Generator shall have its performance based on its metered output to the ERCOT System as measured by the TDSP metering.\n8.1.3.1.3\tAvailability Criteria for Emergency Response Service Resources\n(1)\tNo later than 45 days after the end of an ERS Standard Contract Term, ERCOT shall provide each QSE representing ERS Resources with an availability report for its ERS portfolio for each ERS service type.  The report shall contain:\n(a)\tFor each ERS Time Period and each ERS Contract Period in the ERS Standard Contract Term, the ERS availability factor (ERSAF) for each ERS Resource in the QSE\u2019s ERS portfolio, as described in Sections 8.1.3.1.3.1, Time Period Availability Calculations for Emergency Response Service Loads, and 8.1.3.1.3.2, Time Period Availability Calculations for Emergency Response Service Generators.\n(b)\tFor each ERS Contract Period in the ERS Standard Contract Term, the QSE\u2019s portfolio-level availability factor, as described in Section 8.1.3.3, Payment Reductions and Suspension of Qualification of Emergency Response Service Resources and/or their Qualified Scheduling Entities.\n(c)\tThe QSE\u2019s portfolio-level availability factor for the Standard Contract Term, as described in Section 8.1.3.3. \n8.1.3.1.3.1\tTime Period Availability Calculations for Emergency Response Service Loads\n(1)\tFor an ERS Load on an ERS Default Baseline, ERCOT will calculate its ERSAF as follows:\n(a)\tERCOT will consider the ERS Load to have been unavailable for a 15-minute interval in a contracted ERS Time Period in which any of the following apply:\n(i) \tThe interval Load of the ERS Load was less than 95% of its contracted ERS MW capacity; or\n(ii)\tRequired metered interval data was not provided to ERCOT by the time ERCOT calculated availability for one or more sites in the ERS Resource.  \n(b)  \tOtherwise, the ERS Load will be considered available for that 15-minute interval.  The ERSAF will be the ratio of the number of 15-minute intervals the ERS Load was available during the ERS Time Period divided by the total number of 15-minute intervals in the ERS Time Period.\n(c)\tNotwithstanding the foregoing, in determining the ERSAF, ERCOT will exclude from the calculation the following contracted intervals:",

For an interval, EIPFi is computed as follows:\nEIPF i \t= \tMax(Min(((Base_MWh i \u2013 Actual_MWh i) / (IntFrac i * OFFERMW)),1),0)\nThe above variables are defined as follows:\nVariable\tUnit\tDescription\nIntFrac i\tNone\tInterval fraction for that ERS Resource for that interval.\nBase_MWh i\tMWh\tFor an ERS Load on a default baseline, the aggregated sum of baseline MWh values estimated by ERCOT for all sites in the ERS Load for that interval.\nFor an ERS Load assigned to the alternate baseline, the sum of the ERS Load\u2019s OFFERMW and maximum base Load for that interval.\nFor a stand-alone ERS Generator or an ERS Generator co-located and jointly evaluated with an ERS Load, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System for that interval.\nFor an ERS Generator co-located with, but evaluated separately from an ERS Load, the energy output of the ERS Generator.\nActual_MWh i\tMWh\tFor an ERS Load, the aggregated sum of the actual MWh values for all sites in the ERS Load for that interval.\nFor an ERS Generator, the ERS Generator\u2019s declared injection capacity, expressed in units of MWh.\nOFFERMW\tMWh\tThe ERS Resource\u2019s contracted capacity for that interval expressed in units of MWh.\ni\tNone\tAn interval.\n\tand where IntFrac i corresponds to the fraction of time for that interval for which the Sustained Response Period is in effect and is computed as follows:\nIntFrac i = (CEndT i \u2013 CBegT i) / 15\nThe above variables are defined as follows: \nVariable\tUnit\tDescription\nIntFrac i\tNone\tInterval fraction for that ERS Resource for that interval.\nCBegT i\tMinutes\tIf the Sustained Response Period begins after the start of that interval, the time in minutes from the beginning of that interval to the beginning of the Sustained Response Period, otherwise it is zero.\nCEndT i\tMinutes\tIf the Sustained Response Period ends during that interval, the time in minutes from the beginning of that interval to the end of the Sustained Response Period, otherwise it is 15.\ni\tNone\tAn interval.\n(ii)\tFor an ERS Load assigned to an alternate baseline, if the IntFrac for the first interval of the Sustained Response Period is less than one, the EIPF for that interval shall be calculated as follows:  \n(A)\tIf the actual Load of the full 15-minute interval is less than the maximum base Load, the EIPF for that interval shall be set to one.\n(B)\tIf the QSE submits interval data for the day of the event that is more granular than at the 15-minute interval level that shows the average Load for the ERS Resource was below its maximum base Load for the portion of the interval in the Sustained Response Period, the EIPF for that interval shall be set to one.  This submitted data must be in a format acceptable to ERCOT and include, at a minimum, the actual Load and associated time stamps.\n(C)\tIf the QSE submits other documentary evidence that ERCOT determines, in its discretion, demonstrates the average Load for the ERS Resource was below its maximum base Load for the portion of the interval in the Sustained Response Period, the EIPF for that interval shall be set to one.  The documentary evidence must be supported by a sworn affidavit.\n(D)\tIf none of the above applies, then ERCOT shall calculate EIPF using the formula in subsection (i) above with Base_MWhi determined using one of the baselines described in the document titled \u201cDemand Response Baseline Methodologies\u201d on ERCOT.com.\n(iii)\tIn any ERS Standard Contract Term in which ERCOT has deployed ERS, the ERSEPF for an ERS Resource shall be the time-weighted average of the event performance factors for all events for which the ERS Resource was deployed. \n(iv)\tIrrespective of its ERSEPF, an ERS Resource shall be deemed to have met its event performance requirements if it is an ERS Load determined by ERCOT to have met its Load reduction obligations in the ERS deployment event if measured on one of ERCOT\u2019s established default baseline types other than the baseline type selected by the QSE, and ERCOT determines that the different baseline more accurately represents the ERS Load\u2019s Demand response contribution.\n(4)\tFor an ERS deployment event, ERCOT shall calculate EIPFs and an ERSEPF for a Weather-Sensitive ERS Load, using actual 15-minute interval meter data, or, for Distributed Renewable Generation (DRG) that has been designated by the QSE to be evaluated by using its native load calculated 15-minute interval native load data, consistent with the provisions of paragraph (3)(c)(i) above.  No other provisions in paragraph (3) above shall apply to Weather-Sensitive ERS Loads.\n(5)\tRegardless of the number of enrolled sites in the Weather-Sensitive ERS Load at the time of an event or test, the contracted capacity value (OFFERMW) used will be the value submitted by the QSE in its offer.\n8.1.3.2\tTesting of Emergency Response Service Resources\n(1)\tERCOT may conduct an unannounced test of any ERS Resource at any time during an ERS Time Period in which the ERS Resource is contracted to provide ERS.  Prior to the beginning of a Standard Contract Term, a QSE may request that one or more of its ERS Resources awarded in ERS-30 be tested as if subject to a ten-minute ramp during that ERS Standard Contract Term.  The duration of a test will not count toward the ERS Resource\u2019s maximum cumulative deployment time for an ERS Contract Period.  \n(a)\tFor Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS Resources, ERCOT shall determine a test performance factor for each test using the methodology defined in Section 8.1.3.1.4, Event Performance Criteria for Emergency Response Service Resources.  \n(i)\tThe test performance factors for Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS Resources resulting from those tests will be used in Settlement for that and subsequent ERS Standard Contract Terms as specified in Section 8.1.3.3, Payment Reductions and Suspension of Qualification of Emergency Response Service Resources and/or their Qualified Scheduling Entities.  \n(ii)\tA test shall be deemed to be successful if the ERS Resource achieves both a test performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an EIPF for the full first interval of the test of 0.95 or greater.  \n(iii)\tAn ERS Resource for which the most recent test with a ten-minute ramp was successful shall not be subject to a test for at least 330 days regardless of whether the ERS Resource is participating in ERS-10 or ERS-30.  \n(iv)\tAn ERS Resource for which the most recent test with a 30-minute ramp was successful shall not be subject to a test for at least 330 days unless the ERS Resource participates in ERS-10 during that period.  \n(v)\tAn ERS Resource participating in ERS-10 that meets its ERS-10 performance obligations for all ERS deployment events by achieving both an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an EIPF for the full first interval of 0.95 or greater during an ERS Standard Contract Term shall not be subject to a test for ERS-10 or ERS-30 for at least 330 calendar days following the date of the last deployment of ERS-10 during that ERS Standard Contract Term.  \n(vi)\tAn ERS Resource participating in ERS-30 that meets its ERS-30 performance obligations for all ERS deployment events by achieving both an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an EIPF for the full first interval of 0.95 or greater during an ERS Standard Contract Term shall not be subject to a test for ERS-30 for at least 330 calendar days following the date of the last deployment of ERS-30 during that ERS Standard Contract Term.  \n(vii)\tNotwithstanding the foregoing:\n(A)\tIf the ERSAFCOMB for an ERS Resource for an ERS Standard Contract Term consisting of a single ERS Contract Period is less than 0.85, or the ERSAFCOMB for an ERS Resource for an ERS Contract Period with a duration that is less than an ERS Standard Contract Term is lower than the threshold specified in paragraph (4)(d) of Section 8.1.3.1.3.3, Contract Period Availability Calculations for Emergency Response Service Resources, ERCOT may re-test that ERS Resource without regard to the 330 day limit specified above.\n(B)\tIf an ERS Resource is contracted to provide services under a Must-Run Alternative (MRA) Agreement and has an ERS obligation during an overlapping ERS Standard Contract Term, ERCOT may conduct additional testing to verify the site\u2019s ability to provide both services on the same or consecutive days.  Such testing may be conducted without regard to the 330 day limit specified above and without regard to any recovery periods allowed for either ERS or the MRA Agreement.\n(C)\tIf a single TDSP-metered Premise has more than one ERS site and those ERS sites participate in different ERS Resources, then all of those ERS Resources will be subject to testing if any one of the ERS Resources is subject to testing.\n(b)\tTesting will be considered void and would require re-testing for any non-weather-sensitive Resources if one or more sites of an ERS Resource were disabled or unverifiable due to events on the TDSP side of the meter affecting the supply, delivery or measurement of electricity either during the event or prior that impacts the creation of a credible baseline.  QSEs must provide verification of such events from the TDSP or MRE.\n(c)\tFor Weather-Sensitive ERS Resources, ERCOT shall conduct unannounced testing of each Weather-Sensitive ERS Load at least once but no more than twice per month of obligation during an ERS Standard Contract Term, unless testing has been superseded by deployment events as described in paragraph (vii) below.\n(i)\tThe tests will be conducted according to normal ERS testing procedures.\n(ii)\tAt the time of Dispatch during a test, ERCOT will not advise the QSE of the test duration, which may vary from one full 15-minute interval to 12 full 15-minute intervals.\n(iii)\tERCOT may conduct a test during any of a Weather-Sensitive ERS Load\u2019s obligated hours.  However, tests will generally be targeted toward periods of peak weather conditions. \n(iv)\tFor a Weather-Sensitive ERS Load assigned to the control group baseline, for each test ERCOT will designate a single group which shall be removed from the test population that will serve as the control group.\n(v)\tERCOT shall calculate a test performance factor for each test of a Weather-Sensitive ERS Load using the event performance methodology described in Section 8.1.3.1.4.\n(vi)\tThe QSE is responsible for managing group assignments and for deploying only the sites dispatched by ERCOT during a test.\n(vii)\tERCOT may reduce the number of tests administered by the number of deployment events during the ERS Standard Contract Term. \n(viii)\tThe test performance factors for Weather-Sensitive ERS Resources shall always be set to one for use in Settlement for the ERS Standard Contract Term.\n(ix)\tTesting will be considered void for any weather-sensitive Resources if 10% or more sites of a weather-sensitive Resource were disabled or unverifiable due to events on the TDSP side of the meter affecting the supply, delivery or measurement of electricity either during the event or prior that impacts the creation of a credible baseline.  QSEs must provide verification of such events from the TDSP or MRE.\n(2)\tERCOT shall conduct an unannounced test of an ERS Resource that has been suspended from participation in ERS pursuant to Section 8.1.3.3.  ERCOT will conduct such a test only after the QSE representing the ERS Resource has communicated to ERCOT a request for reinstatement of the suspended ERS Resource.\n(3)\tAn ERCOT unannounced test of an ERS Generator must demonstrate injection of energy to the ERCOT System.  The use of Load banks is prohibited for ERCOT unannounced tests.\n(4)\tIf an ERS Generator is co-located with an ERS Load as specified in Section 8.1.3.1.2, Performance Evaluation for Emergency Response Service Generators, ERCOT shall test both such ERS Resources simultaneously and the following shall apply:\n(a)\tTest performance of the ERS Load and the ERS Generator shall be evaluated jointly and attributed to both if the ERS Load is assigned to a default baseline or is assigned to the alternate baseline and the QSE elected for joint evaluation at the beginning of the ERS Standard Contract Term.\n(b)\tTest performance of the ERS Load and the ERS Generator shall be evaluated separately if the ERS Load is assigned to the alternate baseline and the QSE elected for separate evaluation at the beginning of the ERS Standard Contract Term.  If the separately evaluated ERS Load has no obligation greater than 100 kW in any ERS Time Period and does not meet the criteria for a successful test as defined in item (1)(a)(ii) above, the following shall apply:\n(i)\tIf the interval data measured by the metering on the output of the generator(s) meets the criteria for a successful test as defined in item (1)(a)(ii) above, for the combined obligation of the ERS Load and the ERS Generator, then both the ERS Load and the ERS Generator will be deemed to have performed successfully for that ERS test.\n(ii)\tOtherwise, the ERS Load will be considered to have not performed successfully for that ERS test.\n(5)\tIn order to assist QSEs and ERS Resources in managing environmental compliance, ERCOT shall limit the cumulative duration of Sustained Response Periods of testing of an ERS Resource to a maximum of one hour per ERS Standard Contract Term unless otherwise required to conduct re-testing.\n(6)\tNotwithstanding paragraph (5) above, Weather-Sensitive ERS Resources shall be subject to testing as described in paragraph (1)(c) above.\n8.1.3.3\tPayment Reductions and Suspension of Qualification of Emergency Response Service Resources and/or their Qualified Scheduling Entities\n8.1.3.3.1\tSuspension of Qualification of Non-Weather-Sensitive Emergency Response Service Resources and/or their Qualified Scheduling Entities\n(1)\tIf a QSE\u2019s portfolio-level availability factor and event performance factors as calculated in Section 8.1.3.3.3, Performance Criteria for Qualified Scheduling Entities Representing Non Weather-Sensitive Emergency Response Service Resources, both equal or exceed 0.95, the QSE will be deemed to have met its ERS performance requirements for the ERS Contract Period, and the QSE and its ERS Resources are not subject to suspension.\n(2)\tIf a QSE fails to meet its portfolio-level availability and/or event performance requirements as described in Section 8.1.3.3.3, ERCOT shall take the following actions:\n(a)\tIf a QSE failure is based only on event performance failure and ERS Resources that comprise 95% or more of the QSE\u2019s obligation for each of the events in the ERS Contract Term are deemed to have met their obligations, the QSE shall be deemed to have met its event performance requirements for the ERS Contract Term; otherwise\n(b)\tERCOT may suspend the QSE from participation in ERS, and the QSE may be subject to administrative penalties imposed by the PUCT.  ERCOT may consider mitigating factors such as equipment failures and Force Majeure Events in determining whether to suspend the QSE.\n(3)\tIf a QSE\u2019s portfolio-level availability factor is less than 0.95 excluding the intervals for Resources that had one or more sites of an ERS Resource disabled or unverifiable due to events on the TDSP side of the meter affecting the supply, delivery or measurement of electricity either during the event or prior that impacts the creation of a credible baseline, ERS Resources in that portfolio that were not disabled or unverifiable due to events on the TDSP side of the meter affecting the supply, delivery or measurement of electricity either during the event or prior that impacts the creation of a credible baseline shall be subject to the following: \n(a)\tIf an ERS Resource in the QSE\u2019s portfolio achieves an availability factor of 0.85 or greater, the ERS Resource shall not be subject to a reduction of its availability factor; \n(b)\tIf an ERS Resource achieves an ERSAFCOMB less than 0.85 for an ERS Standard Contract Term consisting of a single ERS Contract Period, or achieves an ERSAFCOMB lower than the threshold specified in paragraph (4)(d) of Section 8.1.3.1.3.3, Contract Period Availability Calculations for Emergency Response Service Resources, for an ERS Contract Period with a duration that is less than an ERS Standard Contract Term, then the ERS Resource\u2019s availability factor shall be squared; and\n(c)\tIf the availability factor for one or more ERS Resources is squared pursuant to paragraph (b) above, ERCOT shall compute the QSE\u2019s final portfolio-level availability factor using that modified availability factor. \n(4)\tERCOT shall calculate a QSE\u2019s portfolio-level event performance factor and interval performance factor for the first full interval of that event. The portfolio for this purpose shall consist of ERS Resources that did not have any sites that were disabled or unverifiable due to events on the TDSP side of the meter affecting the supply, delivery or measurement of electricity either during the event or prior that impacts the creation of a credible baseline. If either the portfolio-level event performance factor or the interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period is less than 0.95, ERCOT shall determine final event performance factors for ERS Resources in the portfolio as follows: \n(a)\tIf an ERS Load in the QSE\u2019s portfolio is not co-located with an ERS Generator or is evaluated separately, as specified in Section 8.1.3.1.2, Performance Evaluation for Emergency Response Service Generators, the final event performance factor for the ERS Load shall be determined as follows:\n(i)\tIf the ERS Load achieves an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of 0.95 or greater, the final event performance factor shall be set equal to the original event performance factor.\n(ii)\tIf the ERS Load achieves an event performance factor of less than 0.95 and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of 0.95 or greater, the baseline for that ERS Load shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final event performance factor being equal to the square of its original event performance factor.\n(iii)\tIf the ERS Load achieves an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of less than 0.95, the baseline for that ERS Resource shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times its original event performance factor.\n(iv)\tIf the ERS Load achieves an event performance factor of less than 0.95 and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of less than 0.95, the baseline for that ERS Resource shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times the square of its original event performance factor.\n(b)\tIf an ERS Generator in the QSE\u2019s portfolio, is not co-located with an ERS Load, the final event performance factor for the ERS Generator shall be determined as follows:\n(i)\tIf the ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of 0.95 or greater, the final event performance factor shall be set equal to original event performance factor.\n(ii)\tIf the ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of less than 0.95 and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of 0.95 or greater, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System by the ERS Generator for each interval of the event shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final event performance factor being equal to the square of its original event performance factor.\n(iii)\tIf the ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of less than 0.95, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System by the ERS Generator for each interval of the event shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times its original event performance factor.\n(iv)\tIf the ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of less than 0.95 and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of less than 0.95, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System by the ERS Generator for each interval of the event shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times the square of its original event performance factor.\n(c)\tIf an ERS Generator in the QSE\u2019s portfolio, is co-located with an ERS Load and is evaluated separately, as specified in Section 8.1.3.1.2, the final event performance factor for the ERS Generator shall be determined as follows:\n(i)\tIf the ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of 0.95 or greater, the final event performance factor shall be set equal to original event performance factor.\n(ii)\tIf the ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of less than 0.95 and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of 0.95 or greater, the energy output by the ERS Generator for each interval of the event shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final event performance factor being equal to the square of its original event performance factor.\n(iii)\tIf the ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of less than 0.95, the energy output by the ERS Generator for each interval of the event shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times its original event performance factor.\n(iv)\tIf the ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of less than 0.95 and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of less than 0.95, the energy output by the ERS Generator for each interval of the event shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times the square of its original event performance factor.\n(d)\tIf an ERS Load and an ERS Generator in a QSE\u2019s portfolio, are co-located and are evaluated jointly, as specified in Section 8.1.3.1.2, the final event performance factor shall be determined as follows:\n(i)\tIf the combined performance of the ERS Load and ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of 0.95 or greater, the final event performance factor for both ERS Resources shall be set equal to original event performance factor.\n(ii)\tIf the combined performance of the ERS Load and ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of less than 0.95 and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of 0.95 or greater, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System by the ERS Generator for each interval of the event shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final combined event performance factor being equal to the square of its original combined event performance factor.  If a reduction factor of zero results in the combined event performance factor being greater than the square of the original combined event performance factor, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System shall be set to zero for all intervals in the event and the baseline for the ERS Load shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final combined event performance factor being equal to the square of the original combined event performance factor.\n(iii)\tIf the combined performance of the ERS Load and ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of 0.95 or greater and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of less than 0.95, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System by the ERS Generator for each interval of the event shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final combined event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times its original event performance factor.  If a reduction factor of zero results in the combined event performance factor being greater than 0.75 times its original event performance factor, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System shall be set to zero for all intervals in the event and the baseline for the ERS Load shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final combined event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times its original event performance factor.\n(iv)\tIf the combined performance of the ERS Load and ERS Generator achieves an event performance factor of less than 0.95 and an interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period of less than 0.95, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System by the ERS Generator for each interval of the event shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final combined event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times the square of its original event performance factor.  If a reduction factor of zero results in the combined event performance factor being greater than 0.75 times the square of its original event performance factor, the net energy injected to the ERCOT System shall be set to zero for all intervals in the event and the baseline for the ERS Load shall be multiplied by a reduction factor that results in the final combined event performance factor being equal to 0.75 times the square of its original event performance factor.\n(e)\tIf the final event performance factor for one or more ERS Resources in a QSE\u2019s portfolio is reduced pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (d) above, ERCOT shall re-compute the QSE\u2019s final portfolio-level event performance factor using each ERS Resource\u2019s final event performance factor. \n(5)\tIf an ERS Resource, in accordance with Section 8.1.3.2, Testing of Emergency Response Service Resources, has failed any two consecutive tests in an ERS Standard Contract Term, or has failed both the first test in an ERS Standard Contract Term and the most recent prior test occurring within 365 days of that first failed test, ERSTESTPF shall be set to the lower of 0.75 or the average of those two test performance factors and shall be used in calculating the payment to the QSE for the ERS Standard Contract Term during which the second failure occurred.  Otherwise, ERSTESTPF shall be set to 1.0.\n(6)\tNotwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (5) above, if an ERS Resource, in accordance with Section 8.1.3.2, has failed the most recent three consecutive tests within a 365 day period, then ERSTESTPF for the ERS Standard Contract Term in which the most recent failure has occurred, shall be determined as follows:\n(a)\tIf the average of ERSTESTPF for those three tests is equal to 0.90 or greater, ERSTESTPF shall be set to 0.5.\n(b)\tIf the average of ERSTESTPF for those three tests is less than 0.90, ERSTESTPF shall be set zero.\n(c)\tIf the ERS Resource has failed the most recent four consecutive tests within a 365 day period, then ERSTESTPF for the ERS Standard Contract Term in which the most recent failure has occurred, shall be set to zero.\n(7)\tNotwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (5) and (6) above, if an ERS Resource, in accordance with Section 8.1.3.1.4, Event Performance Criteria for Emergency Response Service Resources, successfully deploys in all ERS deployment events in which the ERS Resource has an obligation during that ERS Standard Contract Term, ERSTESTPF shall be set to 1.0 for that ERS Standard Contract Term.\n(8)\tIf a Governmental Authority issues a written determination that an ERS Resource is in violation of any environmental law that would preclude the ERS Resource\u2019s compliance with its ERS availability or deployment obligations, ERCOT shall treat the ERS Resource as having no availability for the remainder of the Standard Contract Term following the Governmental Authority\u2019s determination and shall treat the Resource as having an event performance factor of zero for any deployments in the remaining portion of the ERS Standard Contract Term.  ERCOT shall also suspend the ERS Resource\u2019s participation in ERS until the ERS Resource\u2019s QSE certifies to ERCOT in writing that the violation has been remedied and that the ERS Resource may lawfully participate in ERS.\n(9)\tIf a QSE is suspended pursuant to paragraph (2) above, each of the QSE\u2019s ERS Resources whose availability or event performance factors was reduced in accordance with paragraphs (3) or (4) above also shall be suspended, and each of the sites in those ERS Resources shall also be suspended.  The duration of the suspension for such ERS Resources and sites shall be one ERS Standard Contract Term.  ERCOT shall reject offers for ERS Resources that are suspended or that contain one or more suspended sites.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, ERCOT may choose not to suspend an ERS Resource if it determines that the reduced availability or event performance factor was attributable to the fault of its QSE or to one or more mitigating factors, such as equipment failures and Force Majeure Events.\n(10)\tThe suspension of an ERS Resource or a QSE representing an ERS Resource shall begin on the day following the expiration of the current or most recent ERS obligation. \n(11)\tERCOT may reinstate an ERS Resource\u2019s eligibility to offer into ERS upon the ERS Resource\u2019s satisfactory completion of the reinstatement process, including a test conducted by ERCOT, as described in Section 8.1.3.2 and in the ERS technical requirements.\n8.1.3.3.2\tPayment Reduction and Suspension of Qualification of Weather-Sensitive Emergency Response Service Loads and/or their Qualified Scheduling Entities\n(1)\tIf the QSE portfolio-level event performance factor for the QSE\u2019s portfolio of Weather-Sensitive ERS Loads for the ERS Contract Period as calculated in Section 8.1.3.3.4, Performance Criteria for Qualified Scheduling Entities Representing Weather-Sensitive Emergency Response Service Loads, is greater than or equal to 0.90 or if 10% or more sites of an ERS Load were disabled or unverifiable due to events on the TDSP side of the meter affecting the supply, delivery or measurement of electricity either during the event or prior that impacts the creation of a credible baseline, ERCOT shall not impose a payment reduction for any of the those ERS Loads.  Otherwise, ERCOT shall compute QSE portfolio-level Demand reduction values for each test and event throughout the ERS Contract Period as the greater of zero or the portfolio-level baseline estimate for each interval less the portfolio-level actual Load for that interval.  The relationship of the Demand reduction values for each ERS Load to actual weather shall be modeled and used to derive a time-period specific Demand reduction value that would be realized under normalized peak weather conditions.  If the normalized peak Demand reduction value for each ERS Time Period, summed across all ERS Loads in the portfolio is greater than or equal to 90% of the QSE\u2019s total offered MW capacity in that time period, ERCOT shall not impose a payment reduction for any of the ERS Loads in the portfolio.\n(2)\tFor an ERS deployment event for a Weather-Sensitive ERS Load with three or more full intervals in the Sustained Response Period, if the ERS Load\u2019s EIPF for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period is less than 75% of the average EIPF for the remaining full intervals of the Sustained Response Period, the baseline used to evaluate the ERS Load shall be reduced to the level at which the ERSEPF for that event or test is equal to 0.75 times the ERSEPF determined by using the initial baseline.\n(3)\tIf the provisions of paragraph (1) above are not met, ERCOT shall reduce a QSE\u2019s payment for Weather-Sensitive ERS Load as follows:\n(a)\tIf the maximum number of sites in the ERS Load during the ERS Standard Contract Term is less than 80% of the number of sites projected by the QSE at the time of offer submission, as described in paragraph (15) of Section 3.14.3.1, Emergency Response Service Procurement, the baseline used to evaluate the Weather-Sensitive ERS Load shall be reduced to the level at which the ERSEPF is equal to the square of the ERSEPF determined by using the initial baseline. \n(b)\tFor all events occurring in an ERS Time Period, if, for that ERS Time Period the normalized peak Demand reduction value per site within the Weather-Sensitive ERS Load is less than 90% of the average Demand reduction value per site, based on the QSE\u2019s offer for that ERS Time Period, and the ERS Load\u2019s ERSEPF for an event in that ERS Time Period is less than 0.90, the baseline used to evaluate the ERS Load for that event shall be reduced to the level at which the ERS Load\u2019s ERSEPF is equal to the square of the ERSEPF determined by using the initial baseline.\n(c)\tIf either paragraph (3)(a) or (b) above require a payment reduction, but not both, and the normalized peak demand reduction for the resource is greater than or equal to 90% of the QSE\u2019s offered MW capacity, no payment reduction for the event shall be imposed.\n(d)\tIf the provisions of both paragraphs (3)(a) and (b) above require the ERSEPF to be squared, the baseline used to evaluate the ERS Load shall be reduced to the level at which the ERSEPF for the ERS Load is equal to the cube of the ERSEPF determined by using the initial baseline.\n(e)\tIf an ERS Load\u2019s obligation is exhausted during an ERS Contract Period, the provisions of paragraphs (3)(a), (b), and (c) above shall not apply.\n(f)\tBaseline reductions required pursuant to paragraphs (3)(a), (b), and (c) above shall be applied to the initial baseline calculated by ERCOT.  If a baseline reduction pursuant to paragraph (2) above also is required, that reduction shall be based on the adjusted baseline after applying the reductions provided for in paragraphs (3)(a), (b), and (c) above.\n(g)\tIf the final event performance factor for one or more ERS Loads in a QSE\u2019s portfolio of Weather-Sensitive ERS Loads is reduced pursuant to paragraphs (2) or (3)(a), (b), or (d) above, ERCOT shall re-compute the QSE\u2019s final portfolio-level event performance factor using each ERS Load\u2019s adjusted baselines.\n8.1.3.3.3\tPerformance Criteria for Qualified Scheduling Entities Representing Non-Weather-Sensitive Emergency Response Service Resources\n(1)\tA QSE\u2019s ERS performance will be evaluated based on its portfolio\u2019s performance for each of the four ERS service types during ERS deployment events and on the overall availability of its portfolio in an ERS Standard Contract Term, as follows:\n(a)\tAvailability:\n(i)\tERCOT shall calculate a portfolio-level availability factor for each QSE\u2019s ERS portfolio for each ERS service type for each ERS Time Period in an ERS Contract Period using the methodologies defined in Section 8.1.3.1.3, Availability Criteria for Emergency Response Service Resources, except that the availability factor for each ERS Time Period will be allowed to exceed 1.0.  ERCOT shall then calculate a single time- and capacity-weighted availability factor for the QSE portfolio for each ERS service type for the ERS Contract Period using the methodologies defined in Section 8.1.3.1.3.  \n(ii)\tERCOT shall then calculate a single time and capacity-weighted availability factor for the QSE portfolio for the ERS Standard Contract Term and the ERS service type, which will be capped at 1.0.  \n(A)\tFor an ERS Standard Contract Term with a single ERS Contract Period, the QSE portfolio-level availability factor for each ERS service type for the ERS Standard Contract Term shall be the portfolio-level availability factor for each ERS service type for the ERS Contract Period.  \n(B)\tFor an ERS Standard Contract Term with multiple ERS Contract Periods, ERCOT shall compute a QSE portfolio-level availability factor for each ERS service type for the ERS Standard Contract Term by averaging the QSE\u2019s availability factors across ERS Contract Periods and ERS Time Periods for each ERS service type, weighted according to time and capacity obligations.  \n(iii)\tThe QSE\u2019s portfolio-level availability factor for each ERS service type for the ERS Standard Contract Term will determine both the availability component of the ERS payment to the QSE and whether the QSE has met its ERS availability requirements.  If the QSE\u2019s portfolio-level availability factor for each ERS service type for the ERS Standard Contract Term equals or exceeds 0.95, the QSE shall be deemed to have met its availability requirements for the ERS Standard Contract Term; otherwise, the QSE shall be deemed to have failed to meet this requirement.  If the QSE\u2019s portfolio-level availability factor for either ERS service type for the ERS Standard Contract Term is less than 1.0, the QSE\u2019s ERS capacity payment shall be reduced according to the formulas in Section 6.6.11.1, Emergency Response Service Capacity Payments.\n(b)\tEvent Performance: \n(i)\tQSEs representing ERS Resources must meet performance standards specified in Section 8.1.3.1.4, Event Performance Criteria for Emergency Response Service Resources, as applied on a portfolio-level basis.  ERCOT shall determine a QSE\u2019s portfolio-level event performance for each ERS service type by calculating a QSE portfolio-level event performance factor for each ERS deployment event.  For purposes of evaluating ERS Loads, ERCOT shall establish a baseline representing the portfolio\u2019s estimated Load, or, for DRG that has been designated by the QSE to be evaluated by using its native load, calculated 15-minute interval native load data in the absence of the ERS deployment event.  For purposes of evaluating ERS Generators, ERCOT shall compute portfolio-level injection of energy to the ERCOT System.  Using this data, ERCOT shall calculate a QSE portfolio-level event performance factor for each ERS deployment event for each ERS service type based on the weighted average of the event interval performance factors, weighted by the total obligation and IntFrac.  \n(ii)\tERCOT shall then calculate an ERSEPFqrd for the ERS Standard Contract Term, which will be capped at 1.0.  For an ERS Standard Contract Term with no ERS deployment events, the ERSEPFqrd for the ERS Standard Contract Term shall be set to 1.0.  \n(A)\tFor an ERS Standard Contract Term with a single ERS deployment event, the ERSEPFqrd for the ERS Standard Contract Term shall be the QSE portfolio-level event performance factor for the event.  \n(B)\tFor an ERS Standard Contract Term with multiple ERS deployment events, ERCOT shall compute the ERSEPFqrd for the ERS Standard Contract Term by averaging the QSE portfolio-level interval performance factors for all of the deployment events for each ERS service type, weighted by the total obligation and IntFrac.  \n(iii)\tThe ERSEPFqrd for an ERS Standard Contract Term will determine both the event performance component of the ERS payment to the QSE and whether the QSE has met its ERS event performance requirements for that ERS service type.  If an ERSEPFqrd for an ERS Standard Contract Term is greater than or equal to 0.95, the QSE will be deemed to have met its event performance requirements for the ERS Standard Contract Term for that ERS service type; otherwise, the QSE shall be deemed to have failed to meet this requirement.  If a QSE\u2019s ERSEPFqrd is less than 1.0 for the Standard Contract Term, the QSE\u2019s ERS capacity payment shall be reduced according to the formulas in Section 6.6.11.1.  For purposes of calculating an ERSEPFqrd, any ERS Resource that was not subject to Dispatch during the event shall be treated as having met its obligation.\n(iv)\tERCOT will not include any Resources in the calculation of the ERSEPFqrd if one or more sites of an ERS Resource were disabled or unverifiable due to events on the TDSP side of the meter affecting the supply, delivery or measurement of electricity either during the event or prior that impacts the creation of a credible baseline.  QSEs must provide verification of such events from the TDSP or MRE.\n(c)\tTen-minute Deployment:  Within ten minutes of the deployment time within the ERCOT Extensible Markup Language (XML) deployment message for ERS-10, a QSE shall ensure that each ERS Resource participating in ERS-10 in its portfolio deploys in accordance with its obligations.  For each ERS-10 deployment event, ERCOT shall assess each QSE\u2019s compliance with this requirement by calculating a capacity-weighted QSE portfolio-level interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period, using the methodologies defined in Section 8.1.3.1.4.  \n(d)\tThirty-minute Deployment:  Within 30 minutes of the deployment time within the ERCOT XML deployment message for ERS-30, a QSE shall ensure that each ERS Resource participating in its portfolio deploys in accordance with its obligations.  For each ERS-30 deployment event, ERCOT shall assess each QSE\u2019s compliance with this requirement by calculating a capacity-weighted QSE portfolio-level interval performance factor for the first full interval of the Sustained Response Period, using the methodologies defined in Section 8.1.3.1.4.\nThe above variables are defined as follows:\nVariable\tUnit\tDescription\nERSEPFqrd\tNone\tERS Event Performance Factor per QSE per ERS Standard Contract Term per ERS Service Type\u2014Event performance factor for QSE q in ERS Standard Contract Term r and ERS service type d as calculated pursuant to Section 8.1.3.3.1.\nq\tNone\tA QSE.\nr\tNone\tERS Standard Contract Term.\nd\tNone\tERS service type (Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS-10 or Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS-30).\n(2)\tFailure by a QSE portfolio to meet its ERS event performance or availability requirements shall not be cause for revocation of the QSE\u2019s Ancillary Services qualification. \n8.1.3.3.4\tPerformance Criteria for Qualified Scheduling Entities Representing Weather-Sensitive Emergency Response Service Loads \n(1)\tA QSE\u2019s ERS performance will be evaluated based on the performance of its portfolio of Weather-Sensitive ERS Loads during ERS deployment events in an ERS Standard Contract Term as follows:\n(a)\tERCOT shall compute the following quantities at the QSE portfolio level for each interval of a deployment: MW obligation, baseline estimate and actual Demand as the sum of the respective quantities across the ERS Loads, or, for DRG that has been designated by the QSE to be evaluated by using its native load, calculated 15-minute interval native load data in the portfolio with obligations for that interval.  In addition, ERCOT shall compute the QSE\u2019s portfolio-level prorated total obligations as the weighted sum of the obligations of the deployed ERS Loads weighted by the ratio the number of sites participating in the ERS Load during the event to the maximum number of sites projected by the QSE at the time of offer submission and the prorated interval fraction value (IntFrac) for each interval of a deployment as the average respectively of the interval fractions for each of the ERS Loads within its portfolio weighted by the ERS Load\u2019s obligation for that interval multiplied by the ratio of the number of sites participating in the ERS Load during the event to the maximum number of sites projected by the QSE at the time of offer submission.\n(b)\tERCOT shall compute the QSE\u2019s portfolio-level event interval performance factor for each interval of a deployment as specified in Section 8.1.3.1.4, Event Performance Criteria for Emergency Response Service Resources, using the values computed in paragraph (a) above.\n(c)\tERCOT shall compute the QSE\u2019s portfolio-level Weather-Sensitive ERS Load event performance factor (ERSEPF) for each test and event as the weighted average of the event interval performance factors calculated in paragraph (b) above, weighted by the prorated obligation and interval fractions (IntFrac) computed in paragraph (a) above.\n(d)\tERCOT shall compute the QSE\u2019s portfolio-level Weather-Sensitive ERS Load event performance factor for the ERS Contract Period as the average of the event interval performance factors for all tests and events during the ERS Contract Period calculated in paragraph (b) above weighted by the prorated obligation and interval fractions computed in paragraph (a) above.\n(e)\tERCOT will not include any Weather-Sensitive ERS Loads in the calculation of the ERSEPF if 10% or more sites of an ERS Load were disabled or unverifiable due to events on the TDSP side of the meter affecting the supply, delivery or measurement of electricity either during the event or prior that impacts the creation of a credible baseline.  QSEs must provide verification of such events from the TDSP or MRE.\n8.1.3.4\tERCOT Data Collection for Emergency Response Service\n(1)\tERCOT will collect all data necessary to analyze offers, Self-Provision offers, and all availability and performance obligations of ERS Resources and their QSEs under the Protocols.

ERCOT will sum all charges allocated to Load for all QSEs, and divide that total by the total Real-Time Adjusted Metered Load (AML), showing results in dollars per MWh.  \n(ii)\tThe Load-Allocated CRR Monthly Revenue Zonal Amount (LACMRZAMT), as calculated in paragraph (5) of Section 7.5.7, Method for Distributing CRR Auction Revenues, will be summed by Congestion Management Zone (CMZ) for each month for the most recent 13 months, and divided by the sum of the Real-Time AML by CMZ for each month, showing results in dollars per MWh per CMZ. \n(iii)\tERCOT will calculate the total dollars per MWh by CMZ by summing all charges allocated to Load for all QSEs, excluding LACMRZAMT, and dividing that total by the Real-Time AML; this rate will then be added to item (ii) above to calculate the total dollars per MWh by CMZ.\n8.3\tTSP Performance Monitoring and Compliance\n(1)\tERCOT shall develop a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC)- and ERCOT Board-approved Transmission Service Provider (TSP) monitoring program to be included in the Operating Guides for TSPs regarding Real-Time data telemetry performance.\n[NPRR857:  Replace Section 8.3 above with the following upon system implementation and satisfying the following conditions:  (1) Southern Cross provides ERCOT with funds to cover the entire estimated cost of the project; and (2) Southern Cross has signed an interconnection agreement with a TSP and the TSP gives ERCOT written notice that Southern Cross has provided it with:  (a) Notice to proceed with the construction of the interconnection; and (b) The financial security required to fund the interconnection facilities:]\n8.3\tTSP and DCTO Performance Monitoring and Compliance\n(1)\tERCOT shall develop a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC)- and ERCOT Board-approved Transmission Service Provider (TSP) and Direct Current Tie Operator (DCTO) monitoring program to be included in the Operating Guides for TSPs and DCTOs regarding Real-Time data telemetry performance.\n8.4\tERCOT Response to Market Non-Performance\n(1)\tERCOT may require a Market Participant to develop and implement a corrective action plan to address its failure to meet performance criteria in this Section.

Each Settlement Statement for the DAM is deemed to have been available on the posting date specified on the Settlement Calendar, unless ERCOT is notified to the contrary.  If ERCOT receives notice that a Settlement Statement is not available, ERCOT shall make reasonable attempts to provide the Settlement Statement to the Statement Recipient, and ERCOT shall modify the Settlement and billing timeline accordingly for that Settlement Statement.  \n9.2.8\tValidation of the Settlement Statement for the DAM\n(1)\tThe Statement Recipient is deemed to have validated each Settlement Statement for the DAM unless it has raised a Settlement and billing dispute under Section 9.14, Settlement and Billing Dispute Process. \n9.2.9\tSuspension of Issuing Settlement Statements for the DAM\n(1)\tThe ERCOT Board may direct ERCOT to suspend the issuance of any Settlement Statement for the DAM to address unusual circumstances.

If the fifth day is not a Business Day, then ERCOT shall issue the RTM Initial Statement on the next Business Day after the fifth day.  Notwithstanding the above, if the fifth day after the Operating Day is on or prior to the Business Day on which Real-Time prices are final pursuant to paragraph (7) of Section 6.3, Adjustment Period and Real-Time Operations Timeline, then ERCOT shall issue the RTM Initial Statement on the first Business Day after the Real-Time prices are final.\n9.5.5\tRTM Final Statement\n(1)\tERCOT shall issue an RTM Final Statement for each Statement Recipient for a given Operating Day on the 55th day after the Operating Day, unless that 55th day is not a Business Day.  If the 55th day is not a Business Day, then ERCOT shall issue the RTM Final Statement on the first Business Day after the 55th day.\n(2)\tAn RTM Final Statement will reflect differences to financial records generated on the previous Settlement Statement for the given Operating Day. \n9.5.6\tRTM Resettlement Statement\n(1)\tERCOT shall issue a RTM Resettlement Statement using corrected Settlement data due to resolution of Settlement and billing disputes and the correction of errors other than price errors pursuant to this Section.  Any resettlement occurring after an RTM True-Up Statement has been issued must meet the same Interval Data Recorder (IDR) Meter Data Threshold requirements defined in Section 9.5.8, RTM True-Up Statement, and is subject to the same limitations for filing a dispute.  Despite the preceding sentence, the ERCOT Board may, in its discretion, direct ERCOT to run a resettlement of any Operating Day, at any time, to address unusual circumstances.\n(2)\tERCOT shall issue a RTM Resettlement Statement for a given Operating Day due to errors other than errors in prices when:\n(a)\tThe total of all errors other than price errors results in an absolute value impact greater than 4% of the total RTM Statement amount for any single Statement Recipient for the Operating Day;\n(b)\tThe impact to the Statement Recipient is greater than $400.00; and\n(c)\tThe error is discovered, and a Market Notice of the error is provided to Market Participants, within one year of the Operating Day at issue.\n(3)\tChanges to meter data managed through a process other than a dispute or Alternative Dispute Resolution will not require evaluation of a resettlement defined in paragraph (2) above.\n(4)\tFor any Settlement and billing disputes resolved prior to issuance of the RTM Final Statement, ERCOT shall effect the dispute\u2019s resolution on the RTM Final Statement for that Operating Day.  If a dispute is submitted by 15 Business Days after the issuance of the RTM Initial Statement for an Operating Day and is not resolved on the RTM Final Statement, ERCOT will affect the dispute\u2019s resolution on an RTM Resettlement Statement for that Operating Day.  ERCOT shall issue such an RTM Resettlement Statement within a reasonable time after resolving the Settlement and billing dispute.  \n(5)\tERCOT must effect the resolution of any dispute submitted more than 15 Business Days after the issuance of the RTM Initial Statement on the next available Resettlement or RTM True-Up statement for that Operating Day.  For Settlement and billing disputes resolved under Section 9.14, Settlement and Billing Dispute Process, and submitted at least 20 Business Days before the scheduled date for issuance of the RTM True-Up Statement, ERCOT will include adjustments relating to the dispute on the RTM True-Up Statement.  Resolved disputes must be included on the next available Settlement Invoice after ERCOT has issued the RTM True-Up Statement.\n(6)\tERCOT may not issue an RTM Resettlement Statement less than 20 days before a scheduled RTM Final Statement or RTM True-Up Statement for the relevant Operating Day.  An RTM Resettlement Statement will reflect differences to financial records generated on the previous Settlement Statement for the given Operating Day.\n(7)\tERCOT may issue an RTM Resettlement Statement after the issuance of an RTM Final Statement in order to resolve approved disputes related to Section 5.6.5.2, RUC Make-Whole Payment and RUC Clawback Charge for Resources Receiving OSAs.\n(8)\tERCOT may issue RTM Resettlement Statements after the timeline referenced in paragraph (2) above if directed by the ERCOT Board, the result of a resolution of an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) procedure, or under the procedure for Return of Settlement Funds.\n(9)\tIf ERCOT is required to issue a Resettlement Statement per this Section, but resettlement is not practicable due to system limitations, ERCOT shall make the adjustments through a separate Invoice that is produced outside of normal Settlement Invoices.  The appropriate payments and charges, along with Settlement quality information, shall be supplied to all impacted Market Participants.  \n9.5.7\tNotice of Resettlement for the Real-Time Market\n(1)\tWhile maintaining confidentiality of all Market Participants, ERCOT shall send a Market Notice in conjunction with the resettlement, indicating the resettlement of a specific Operating Day and the date of issuance of the RTM Resettlement Statements.  ERCOT shall include the following information in the notice of resettlement:\n(a)\tDetailed description of reason(s) for resettlement;\n(b)\tAffected Operating Days;\n(c)\tAffected settlement Charge Types; and\n(d)\tTotal resettled amount, by Charge Type.\n9.5.8\tRTM True-Up Statement\n(1)\tERCOT shall use the best available Settlement data, as described in Section 9.5.2, Settlement Statements for the RTM, to produce an RTM True-Up Statement for each Statement Recipient for each given Operating Day.\n(2)\tERCOT shall issue RTM True-Up Statements 180 days following the Operating Day, if ERCOT has received and validated usage data from at least 99% of the total number of Electric Service Identifiers (ESI IDs) with a BUSIDRRQ Load Profile Type code and if ERCOT has received and validated usage data from at least 90% of the total number of ESI IDs with a BUSIDRRQ Load Profile Type code from each Meter Reading Entity (MRE) representing at least 20 Interval Data Recorder (IDR) ESI IDs (IDR Meter Data Threshold).  If the above conditions have not been met, then ERCOT shall issue RTM True-Up Statements as soon as the IDR Meter data becomes available for that Operating Day.  If no RTM True-Up Statement has been issued 365 days after the Operating Day, then ERCOT shall issue a RTM True-Up Statement for that Operating Day.  If any RTM True-Up Statement issuance date does not fall on a Business Day, then the RTM True-Up Statement must be issued by the end of the next Business Day after the RTM True-Up Settlement date.\n(3)\tAn RTM True-Up Statement will reflect differences to financial records generated on the previous Settlement Statement for the given Operating Day. \n9.5.9\tNotice of True-Up Settlement Timeline Changes for the Real-Time Market\n(1)\tIf the IDR Meter Data Threshold has not been met by the 180th day after the Operating Day (or, if the 180th day is not a Business Day, by the next day thereafter that is a Business Day), then ERCOT shall send a Market Notice about the delay of any RTM True-Up Statement issuance indicating the IDR Meter Data Threshold has not been met.\n(2)\tFor any delayed RTM True-Up Statement, ERCOT shall send a Market Notice indicating that it will issue an RTM True-Up Statement for a specific Operating Day within two Business Days after discovering the delay.  As soon as practicable, ERCOT shall send a Market Notice with the revised date on which the delayed RTM True-Up Statement will be issued.\n9.5.10\tConfirmation for the Real-Time Market\n(1)\tIt is the responsibility of each Statement Recipient to notify ERCOT if a Settlement Statement for the RTM is not available on the MIS Certified Area on the date specified for posting of that Settlement Statement in the Settlement Calendar.  Each Settlement Statement for the RTM is deemed to have been available on the posting date specified on the Settlement Calendar, unless it notifies ERCOT to the contrary.  If ERCOT receives notice that a Settlement Statement is not available, ERCOT shall make reasonable attempts to provide the Settlement Statement to the Statement Recipient, and ERCOT shall modify the Settlement and billing timeline accordingly for that Settlement Statement.  \n9.5.11\tValidation of the True-Up Statement for the Real-Time Market\n(1)\tThe Statement Recipient is considered to have validated each RTM True-Up Statement unless it has filed a Settlement and billing dispute or reported an exception within ten Business Days after the RTM True-Up Statement has been posted on the MIS Certified Area.  \n9.5.12\tSuspension of Issuing Settlement Statements for the Real-Time Market\n(1)\tThe ERCOT Board may direct ERCOT to suspend the issuance of any Settlement Statement for the RTM to address unusual circumstances.  Any proposal to suspend settlements must be presented to the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) for review and comment, in a reasonable manner under the circumstances, before such suspension.\n9.6\tSettlement Invoices for the Day-Ahead Market and Real-Time Market\n(1)\tERCOT shall prepare Settlement Invoices on a net basis based on Day-Ahead Market (DAM) Statements, DAM Resettlement Statements, Real-Time Market (RTM) Initial Statements, RTM Final Statements, RTM True-Up Statements and RTM Resettlement Statements.  ERCOT shall issue the Settlement Invoices on the same Business Day as the day that the DAM and RTM Statements are posted to the Market Information System (MIS) Certified Area.  ERCOT will post the actual dates that it will issue the Settlement Invoices under Section 9.1.2, Settlement Calendar.  The Market Participant to whom the Settlement Invoice is addressed (\u201cInvoice Recipient\u201d) is either a net payee or net payor.  \n(2)\tEach Invoice Recipient shall pay any net debit and be entitled to receive any net credit shown on the Settlement Invoice on the payment due date, whether or not there is any Settlement and billing dispute regarding the amount of the debit or credit.\n(3)\tERCOT shall post Settlement Invoices on the MIS Certified Area.  The Invoice Recipient is responsible for accessing the Settlement Invoice on the MIS Certified Area once posted by ERCOT. \n(4)\tSettlement Invoice items must be grouped by DAM, DAM Resettlement, RTM Initial, RTM Final, RTM Resettlement, and RTM True-Up categories and must be sorted by Operating Day within each category.

If the amount of any such draw is greater than the amount of the short-paying Invoice Recipient\u2019s cash collateral held in excess of that required to cover its Total Potential Exposure (TPE) (\u201cExcess Collateral\u201d), then a draw on available security for a short-paying Invoice Recipient shall be considered a Late Payment for purposes of Section 16.11.6, Payment Breach and Late Payments by Market Participants.\n(c)\tERCOT shall offset or recoup any amounts owed, or to be owed, by ERCOT to a short-paying Invoice Recipient against amounts not paid by that Invoice Recipient and ERCOT shall apply the amount offset or recouped to cover payment shortages by that Invoice Recipient.\n(d)\tIf, after taking the actions set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), above, ERCOT still does not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts that it owes to CARD Invoice Recipients in full, ERCOT shall reduce payments to all CARD Invoice Recipients owed monies from ERCOT.  The reductions shall be based on a pro rata basis of monies owed to each CARD Invoice Recipient, to the extent necessary to clear ERCOT\u2019s accounts on the payment due date to achieve revenue neutrality for ERCOT.  ERCOT shall provide to all Market Participants payment details on all short payments and subsequent reimbursements of short pays.  Details must include the identity of each short-paying Invoice Recipient and the dollar amount attributable to that Invoice Recipient, broken down by Invoice numbers.  In addition, ERCOT shall provide the aggregate total of all amounts due to all Invoice Recipients before applying the amount not paid on the CARD Invoice.\n9.11.4\tEnforcing the Security of a Short-Paying CARD Invoice Recipient\n(1)\tERCOT shall make reasonable efforts to enforce the security of the short-paying Invoice Recipient (pursuant to Section 16.11.6, Payment Breach and Late Payments by Market Participants) to the extent necessary to cover the short-pay.  A short-paying Invoice Recipient shall restore the level of its security under Section 16, Registration and Qualification of Market Participants.\n9.12\tCRR Balancing Account Invoices\n(1)\tERCOT shall prepare Invoices for the Congestion Revenue Right (CRR) Balancing Account (CRRBA) on a monthly basis on the first Business Day following the Real-Time Market (RTM) Initial Settlement posting of the last day of the month on the date specified in the Settlement Calendar.\n(2)\tERCOT shall true up the distribution of monthly the CRRBA by posting additional Settlement Invoices on the first Business Day following the RTM Final Settlement posting of the last day of the month on the date specified in the Settlement Calendar.  A trued up CRRBA Invoice will reflect differences to financial records generated on the previous CRRBA Invoice for a given month.\n(3)\tERCOT shall prepare resettlement Invoices in the event that the balance in the CRRBA for the month changes due to a Day-Ahead Market (DAM) resettlement after the initial balancing account Invoices for that month have been posted as specified in the Settlement Calendar.  The Monthly Load Ratio Share (MLRS) as described in Section 7.9.3.5, CRR Balancing Account Closure, used for the resettlement CRRBA Invoice will be the same one used for the most recently posted balancing account Invoices.  A resettlement CRRBA Invoice will reflect differences to financial records generated on the previous CRRBA Invoice for a given month.\n(4)\tFor each Invoice cycle, the Market Participant to whom the CRRBA Invoice is addressed (\u201cInvoice Recipient\u201d) is a payee.  The Invoice Recipient is responsible for accessing the CRRBA Invoice on the Market Information System (MIS) Certified Area once posted by ERCOT.\n(5)\tERCOT shall post on the MIS Certified Area for each Invoice Recipient a CRRBA Invoice based on the calculations located in Sections 7.9.3.4, Monthly Refunds to Short-Paid CRR Owners, and 7.9.3.5.\n(6)\tCRRBA Invoices must contain the following information: \n(a)\tThe Invoice Recipient\u2019s name;\n(b)\tThe ERCOT identifier (Settlement identification number issued by ERCOT); \n(c)\tNet Amount Payable \u2013 the aggregate summary of all amounts owed to the Invoice Recipient summarized by month;\n(d)\tTime Period \u2013 the time period covered for each line item;\n(e)\tRun Date \u2013 the date on which the ERCOT created and published Invoice;\n(f)\tInvoice Reference Number \u2013 a unique number generated by ERCOT for payment tracking purposes; and\n(g)\tPayment Date \u2013 the date and time that Invoice amounts are to be received.\n(7)\tEach Invoice Recipient shall receive any credit shown on the CRRBA Invoice on the payment due date.  Credit shown on the CRRBA Invoice will be paid on due date whether or not there is any Settlement and billing dispute regarding the amount of the payment.\n9.13\tPayment Process for the CRR Balancing Account\n9.13.1\tPayment Process for the Initial CRR Balancing Account\n(1)\tPayments for the Congestion Revenue Right (CRR) Balancing Account (CRRBA) are due on a Business Day and Bank Business Day basis in a one-day, one-step process, as detailed below.\n(a)\tBy 1700 on the first day that is both a Business Day and a Bank Business Day following the due date of the Settlement Invoice that includes the Real-Time Market (RTM) Initial Settlement Statement for the last day of the month and subject to ERCOT\u2019s right to withhold payments under Section 16, Registration and Qualification of Market Participants, and pursuant to common law, ERCOT shall pay on a net credit shown on the CRRBA Invoice based on amounts due:\n(i)\tTo each short-paid CRR Owner a monthly refund from the positive balance in the CRRBA, with the amount paid to each CRR Owner as calculated in Section 7.9.3.4, Monthly Refunds to Short-Paid CRR Owners; and  \n(ii)\tTo each Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE), any remaining positive balance in the CRRBA, with the amount paid to each QSE as calculated in Section 7.9.3.5, CRR Balancing Account Closure.\n(b)\tERCOT shall give irrevocable instructions to the ERCOT financial institution to remit, to each CRR Owner or QSE, for same day value, the amounts determined by ERCOT to be available for payment. \n9.13.2 \tPayment Process for Resettlement of the CRR Balancing Account\n(1)\tIn the event that a resettlement CRRBA Invoice is required, payments for the resettlement CRRBA Invoice are due on a Business Day and Bank Business Day basis in a two-day, two-step process as detailed below in Section 9.13.2.1, Invoice Recipient Payment to ERCOT for Resettlement of the CRR Balancing Account. \n9.13.2.1\tInvoice Recipient Payment to ERCOT for Resettlement of the CRR Balancing Account\n(1)\tThe payment due date and time for the resettlement CRRBA Invoice, with funds owed by an Invoice Recipient, is 1700 on the fifth Bank Business Day after the resettlement CRRBA Invoice date, unless the fifth Bank Business Day is not a Business Day.

The Invoice Recipient payment to ERCOT for resettlement of the CRRBA is subject to ERCOT\u2019s right to withhold payments under Section 16, Registration and Qualification of Market Participants.\n(2)\tERCOT shall give irrevocable instructions to the ERCOT financial institution to remit to each Invoice Recipient for same day value, the amounts owed to each Invoice Recipient. \n9.13.2.3\tPartial Payments by Invoice Recipients for Resettlement of CRR Balancing Account\n(1)\tIf at least one Invoice Recipient owing funds does not pay its resettlement CRRBA Invoice in full (short-pay), ERCOT shall follow the procedure set forth below:\n(a)\tERCOT shall make every reasonable attempt to collect payment from each short-paying Invoice Recipient before any payments owed by ERCOT for that month\u2019s distribution of resettlement CRRBA revenues is due to be paid to applicable Invoice Recipient(s). \n(b)\tERCOT shall draw on any available security pledged to ERCOT by each short-paying Invoice Recipient that did not pay the amount due under paragraph (a) above.  If the amount of any such draw is greater than the amount of the short-paying Invoice Recipient\u2019s cash collateral held in excess of that required to cover its Total Potential Exposure (TPE) (\u201cExcess Collateral\u201d), then a draw on available security for a short-paying Invoice Recipient shall be considered a Late Payment for purposes of Section 16.11.6, Payment Breach and Late Payments by Market Participants.\n(c)\tERCOT shall offset or recoup any amounts owed, or to be owed, by ERCOT to a short-paying Invoice Recipient against amounts not paid by that Invoice Recipient and ERCOT shall apply the amount offset or recouped to cover payment shortages by that Invoice Recipient.\n(d)\tIf, after taking the actions set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, ERCOT still does not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts that it owes to resettlement CRRBA Invoice Recipients in full, ERCOT shall reduce payments to all resettlement CRRBA Invoice Recipients owed monies from ERCOT.  The reductions shall be based on a pro rata basis of monies owed to each resettlement CRRBA Invoice Recipient, to the extent necessary to clear ERCOT\u2019s accounts on the payment due date to achieve revenue neutrality for ERCOT.  ERCOT shall provide to all Market Participants payment details on all short payments and subsequent reimbursements of short pays.  Details must include the identity of each short-paying Invoice Recipient and the dollar amount attributable to that Invoice Recipient, broken down by Invoice numbers.  In addition, ERCOT shall provide the aggregate total of all amounts due to all Invoice Recipients before applying the amount not paid on the resettlement CRRBA Invoice.\n9.14\tSettlement and Billing Dispute Process\n9.14.1\tData Review, Validation, Confirmation, and Dispute of Settlement Statements\n(1)\tSettlement Statement Recipients and Invoice Recipients for the Day-Ahead Market (DAM), Real-Time Market (RTM), and Congestion Revenue Right (CRR) Auction are responsible for reviewing their Settlement Statements and Settlement Invoices to verify the accuracy of the data used to produce them.  Other than disputes related to resettlement arising from a completed Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) proceeding, Settlement Statement Recipients and Invoice Recipients must submit any dispute related to a Settlement Statement or Settlement Invoice pursuant to this Section.  A Market Participant who wishes to dispute a resettlement arising from a completed ADR proceeding must appeal ERCOT\u2019s disposition of that proceeding in accordance with paragraph (4) of Section 20.9, Resolution of Alternative Dispute Resolution Proceedings and Notification to Market Participants.\n9.14.2\tNotice of Dispute\n(1)\tA Settlement Statement Recipient may dispute items or calculations in the most recently issued Settlement Statement for an Operating Day, except as limited for RTM True-Up Statements in paragraph (3) below.  The dispute will apply to the Operating Day in question, not to the associated Settlement Statement.  The Market Participant must enter the Settlement and billing dispute electronically through the ERCOT dispute tool provided on the Market Information System (MIS) Certified Area.  In processing disputes under this Section, ERCOT will analyze the latest Settlement Statement issued.    \n(2)\tAn Invoice Recipient may dispute elements of an Invoice that are not the result of a Settlement Statement that are contained on the Invoice.  The Invoice Recipient must file the Invoice dispute within ten Business Days of the date on which ERCOT posted the Invoice.\n(3)\tThe Settlement Statement Recipient is deemed to have validated each RTM True-Up Statement or Resettlement Statement arising from the True-Up Statement unless it has raised a Settlement and billing dispute or reported an exception within ten Business Days of the date on which ERCOT issued the Settlement Statement.  With respect to an RTM True-Up Statement or any subsequent Resettlement Statement after ERCOT issued the True-Up Statement, ERCOT will consider only Settlement and billing disputes associated with incremental changes between the RTM True-Up Statement or Resettlement Statement, and the most recent previous Settlement Statement for that Operating Day.  The Settlement Statement Recipient may recover only the amounts associated with the incremental monetary change between the prior statement and the statement from which the dispute arose.  ERCOT shall reject late-filed Settlement and billing disputes.  Once the deadline for filing a dispute has passed, the RTM True-Up Statement binds the Settlement Statement Recipient to which it relates unless ERCOT issues a subsequent Resettlement Statement pursuant to this Section.    \n(4)\tERCOT shall reject Settlement and billing disputes for a given Operating Day during the 20 Business Days before the scheduled date for issuance of the RTM True-Up Statement for that Operating Day. \n(5)\tHowever, to the extent a disputing party claims that the Settlement or billing dispute relates to information made available under Section 1.3.3, Expiration of Confidentiality, the disputing party must register the Settlement and billing dispute with ERCOT by electronic means within 60 days after the date the information became available.  All communication to and from ERCOT concerning disputes must be made through either the MIS Certified Area or other electronic communication.\n(6)\tThe Settlement Statement Recipient is deemed to have validated each DAM Settlement or Resettlement Statement unless it has raised a Settlement and billing dispute or reported an exception within ten Business Days of the date on which ERCOT issued the Settlement or Resettlement Statement.  With respect to a DAM Resettlement Statement, ERCOT will consider only Settlement and billing disputes associated with incremental changes between the DAM Resettlement Statement and the most recent previous Settlement Statement for that Operating Day.  The Settlement Statement Recipient may recover only the amounts associated with the incremental monetary change between the prior statement and the statement from which the dispute arose.  ERCOT shall reject late-filed Settlement and billing disputes.  Once the deadline for filing a dispute has passed, a DAM Statement binds the Settlement Statement Recipient to which it relates unless ERCOT issues a subsequent Resettlement Statement.\n(7)\tA CRR Auction Invoice, CRR Auction Revenue Distribution (CARD) Invoice, or CRR Balancing Account (CRRBA) Invoice Recipient may dispute elements of an Invoice that are contained on the Invoice.  The Invoice Recipient must file the CRR Invoice dispute within ten Business Days of the date on which ERCOT posted the Invoice.\n9.14.3\tContents of Notice\n(1)\tERCOT shall reject a dispute that does not contain the data elements listed in this Section.\n(2)\tERCOT shall provide automatic field population techniques or drop-down boxes for appropriate data elements below.  The notice of Settlement and billing dispute must state clearly:\n(a)\tDisputing Entity;\n(b)\tDispute contact person(s);\n(c)\tDispute contact information;\n(d)\tOperating Day or Invoice date in dispute;\n(e)\tCharge Type;\n(f)\tTime period in dispute;\n(g)\tAmount in dispute;\n(h)\tSettlement and billing dispute type; and\n(i)\tReasons for the dispute.\n(3)\tEach Settlement and billing dispute must specify an Operating Day or Invoice date and a Charge Type.  If a condition causing a dispute affects multiple Operating Days or Charge Types, a Settlement Statement Recipient or Invoice Recipient may file a dispute form for each Charge Type for one or more Operating Days affected on a single dispute that are all in the same calendar month.\n(4)\tA Settlement Statement Recipient or Invoice Recipient may pursue the dispute through any process provided by ERCOT for resolving differences in Settlement determinants.\n(5)\tForms for entering a Settlement and billing dispute must be provided on the MIS Certified Area.\n(6)\tThe Market Participant must submit the Settlement and billing dispute to ERCOT with sufficient evidence to support the claim.  \n(7)\tThe Market Participant must submit a dispute using an ERCOT-approved electronic format.  ERCOT shall provide a dispute tracking identifier to the Settlement Statement Recipient or Invoice Recipient.\n9.14.4\tERCOT Processing of Disputes\n(1)\tERCOT shall process disputes in accordance with this Section, Section 9.14.2, Notice of Dispute, and the required data in Section 9.14.3, Contents of Notice.\n(2)\tIf ERCOT requires additional data to resolve the dispute, ERCOT shall send the Settlement Statement Recipient or Invoice Recipient a list of the required additional data within seven Business Days of the date the dispute was filed.  The Settlement Statement Recipient or Invoice Recipient shall respond with the entire set of required data within five Business Days of ERCOT\u2019s request or by a date agreed upon by ERCOT and the Market Participant that is no later than eight Business Days prior to the posting of the True-Up Settlement Statement for the disputed Operating Day.  If ERCOT does not receive the data within that time frame, ERCOT shall deny the dispute.\n(3)\tOn each Business Day, ERCOT shall issue an aggregated Settlement and billing dispute resolution report on the MIS Secure Area containing information related to all disputes that are not yet closed or that have been closed recently.  Additionally, on each Business Day and for each Settlement Statement Recipient or Invoice Recipient, ERCOT shall issue a report on the MIS Certified Area containing the status of each submitted dispute.  The report shall identify the disputed charge type(s), status of the dispute, resolution and resolution date, if applicable, and a financial impact in dollars of the dispute as submitted by disputing Entity.\n[NPRR1239:  Replace paragraph (3) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(3)\tOn each Business Day, ERCOT shall issue an aggregated Settlement and billing dispute resolution report on the ERCOT website containing information related to all disputes that are not yet closed or that have been closed recently.  Additionally, on each Business Day and for each Settlement Statement Recipient or Invoice Recipient, ERCOT shall issue a report on the MIS Certified Area containing the status of each submitted dispute.  The report shall identify the disputed charge type(s), status of the dispute, resolution and resolution date, if applicable, and a financial impact in dollars of the dispute as submitted by disputing Entity. \n(4)\tERCOT shall make all reasonable attempts to complete all RTM Settlement and billing disputes submitted within 15 Business Days of the issuance of the RTM Initial Statement in time for inclusion on the RTM Final Statement for the relevant Operating Day.\n(5)\tAll complete disputes of the DAM received within ten Business Days after ERCOT posts that day\u2019s DAM Settlement Statement shall be included in a Resettlement of the DAM Operating Day under Section 9.2.5, DAM Resettlement Statement.  \n(6)\tFor Settlement and billing disputes requiring complex research or additional time for resolution, ERCOT shall notify the Invoice Recipient or Settlement Statement Recipient of the length of time expected to research and resolve those disputes and, if ERCOT grants a portion or all of the dispute, ERCOT shall post the necessary adjustments on the next available Settlement Statement for the Operating Day.  \n(7)\tSettlement Statement Recipients or Invoice Recipients have the right to proceed to the ADR process in Section 20, Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedure and Procedure for Return of Settlement Funds, for filed disputes that cannot be resolved through the Settlement and billing dispute process outlined in Section 9.14, Settlement and Billing Dispute Process.\n(8)\tAll complete disputes of the CRR Market received within ten Business Days after ERCOT posts that day\u2019s CRR Settlement Statement shall be resolved as soon as practicable.  \n 9.14.4.1\tStatus of Dispute \n(1)\tERCOT will assign a status to each dispute as defined in the following Sections.\n9.14.4.1.1\tNot Started\n(1)\tThe status of a Settlement and billing dispute will initially be set to \u201cNot Started\u201d when the Market Participant enters the dispute into the ERCOT dispute resolution system. \n9.14.4.1.2\tOpen \n(1)\tThe status of a Settlement and billing dispute is set to \u201cOpen\u201d when the Settlement Statement or Invoice Recipient submits a dispute to ERCOT and ERCOT begins the resolution process. \n9.14.4.1.3\tClosed\n(1)\tWhen the status is set to \u201cClosed,\u201d no updates or additions are permitted to the dispute record.  The status of the dispute is \u201cClosed\u201d when one of the following conditions occurs:\n(a)\tIf, after 45 days from receiving notice of a denied dispute, the Settlement Statement Recipient or Invoice Recipient does not begin the ADR process, ERCOT will close the dispute.  \n(b)\tIf ERCOT grants a Settlement and billing dispute, ERCOT will close the dispute no sooner than the date ERCOT publishes the next available Settlement Statement or Invoice for the associated Operating Day.  \n(c)\tIf ERCOT grants a dispute with exceptions, ERCOT will close the dispute no sooner than ten Business Days after ERCOT publishes the resolution.  If the Settlement Statement Recipient or Invoice Recipient disagrees with ERCOT\u2019s exceptions, ERCOT will close dispute upon completion of further investigation and resolution in accordance with Section 9.14.4.2.3, Granted with Exceptions.\n9.14.4.1.4\tRejected\n(1)\tERCOT shall set the status of a Settlement and billing dispute to \u201cRejected\u201d when one of the following circumstances is met:\n(a) \tThe dispute is filed late, unless filed in accordance with paragraph (5) of Section 9.14.2, Notice of Dispute, due to an expiration of confidentiality as defined under Section 1.3.3, Expiration of Confidentiality. \n(b)\tDuring the 20 Business Days before the scheduled date for issuance of the RTM True-Up Statement for that Operating Day. \n(c)\tThe dispute does not contain the required data as set forth in Section 9.14.3, Contents of Notice.

Inquiries or disputes concerning such decisions, Protocols, or Operating Guides must be handled through the Protocol change process set forth in Section 21, Revision Request Process.\n9.14.7\tDisputes for RUC Make-Whole Payment for Fuel Costs\n(1)\tIf the actual price paid for delivered natural gas for a specific Resource during a Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC)-Committed Interval is greater than Fuel Index Price (FIP) adjusted by the proxy fuel adder, X, defined in the Verifiable Cost Manual (i.e., FIP * (1+X)), then the QSE may file a Settlement dispute for that Resource\u2019s RUC Make-Whole Payment.  The maximum amount that may be recovered through this dispute process is the difference between the RUC Guarantee based on the actual price paid and the RUC Guarantee based on the fuel index price FIP * (1+X).  When calculating the RUC Guarantee based on the actual price paid for Resources with approved verifiable costs, the RUC Guarantee may be adjusted to reflect the cost difference between the fuel burned and the fuel calculated based on verifiable cost rates.  This adjustment will allow for the RUC Guarantee to include the fuel cost of the actual fuel burned, as documented by an invoice or equivalent document, up to 120% of the fuel quantity calculated based on verifiable cost data.  If due to extraordinary circumstances the fuel burned exceeded 120% of the fuel quantity calculated based on verifiable cost data, the QSE may submit an attestation attesting to the accuracy of the fuel data along with an explanation for the higher fuel quantities.  ERCOT may include the cost of this additional fuel in the adjustment to the RUC Guarantee.  The QSE must provide documentation (invoices or contracts, as applicable) that identifies intra-day, same-day, or spot market costs of natural gas consumed during the RUC-Committed Interval.  Such documentation is necessary to justify recovery of natural gas costs, which is limited to the actual fuel amount (MMBtus) consumed during RUC-Committed Intervals.  All documentation submitted by the QSE for natural gas costs incurred intra-day, same-day, or via spot market must show a nexus from the seller or distributor of natural gas products to the QSE, Resource Entity or Generation Entity as the ultimate buyer.  The QSE must demonstrate that the seller or distributor has procured natural gas fuel intra-day, same-day, or via spot market.  A Power Purchase or Tolling Agreement (PPA) filed as documentation of proof of fuel costs will not be accepted unless the PPA was signed prior to July 16, 2008, and is not between Affiliates, subsidiaries, or partners.\n(2)\tIf the QSE submitting a Settlement dispute under paragraph (1) above, or the Resource Entity for the Resource, has an executed and enforceable transportation contract (together with any associated statement of operating conditions), on an interstate or intrastate pipeline, for the Generation Resource that received the RUC instruction, the QSE must show proof that the QSE or Resource Entity (or another entity acting on behalf of the Resource Entity with respect to fuel procurement) purchased and nominated fuel in sufficient quantities to start and operate the Resource at its Low Sustained Limit (LSL) during the RUC-Committed Intervals. \n(3)\tThe QSE or Resource Entity must purchase and nominate fuel as described in paragraph (2) above unless one or more of the conditions below applies:\n(a)\tThe Resource received an initial RUC instruction for less than 12 contiguous hours within the same gas delivery day;\n(b)\tThe QSE or Resource Entity did not have sufficient time to procure and nominate fuel after receiving the RUC instruction;\n(c)\tThe RUC instruction was instructed outside of Business Hours or otherwise at a time when the Resource was unable to procure fuel.  \n(4)\tIf the QSE or Resource Entity did not or was not able to nominate fuel for the RUC-Committed Intervals, ERCOT may require proof that following a reasonable effort to secure fuel, the QSE or Resource Entity was not able to both purchase and nominate fuel for reasons beyond the QSE\u2019s or Resource Entity\u2019s control, or that nominating such fuel would have resulted in higher overall fuel costs.  ERCOT may require an attestation signed by an officer or executive with authority to bind the QSE stating that the information contained in the dispute is accurate and that the costs included are variable based on the dispatch of the Resource, to the best of knowledge and belief. \n(a)\tA QSE or Resource Entity is not required to procure and nominate fuel after the initial RUC instruction for incremental RUC instructed hours unless the extended RUC instruction individually meets the requirements under paragraphs (2) and (3) above.\n(5)\tNotwithstanding the provision in paragraph (1) above, the cost of fuel may also include penalties for fuel delivery outside of RUC-Committed Intervals in accordance with the ratable delivery obligations and costs as specified in the enforceable transportation agreement.  In addition, if the QSE or Resource Entity (or another entity acting on behalf of the Resource with respect to fuel procurement) has purchased sufficient fuel quantities to start and operate the Resource at its LSL during the RUC-Committed Intervals and is eligible to receive a Startup Cost, as described in Section 5.6.2, RUC Startup Cost Eligibility, or Section 5.6.3, Forced Outage of a RUC-Committed Resource, but trips Off-Line, the QSE is eligible to recover associated fuel penalties incurred through the end of the gas day, including the net cost of fuel that was purchased and nominated for the gas delivery day to operate the Resource at LSL for the RUC-Instructed hours, but was not used.  A QSE or Resource Entity shall make a commercially reasonable effort to sell the fuel that was not used and shall provide the residual value for any fuel not used or sold.\n(6)\tIf the actual price paid for the delivered fuel oil used to replace oil consumed during a RUC-Committed Interval is greater than Fuel Oil Price (FOP) adjusted by the proxy fuel adder, X, defined in the Verifiable Cost Manual (i.e., FOP * (1+X)), then the QSE may file a Settlement dispute for the Resource\u2019s RUC Make-Whole Payment.  The maximum amount that may be recovered through this dispute process is the difference between the RUC Guarantee based on the actual price paid and the adjusted price, FOP * (1+X).  \n(7)\tIf the QSE representing the Generation Resource made a Three-Part Supply Offer into the DAM based on FIP and had to run on fuel oil in a RUC-Committed Hour with an active Three-Part Supply Offer based on the adjusted FIP, the QSE may file a Settlement dispute to recover the difference between the RUC Guarantee based actual price paid for delivered fuel oil and the fuel price of FIP * (1+X).  \n(8)\tWhen filing a Settlement dispute under paragraph (6) or (7) above, the QSE must provide documentation (invoices) that identifies purchases of fuel oil by the QSE, Resource Entity, or Generation Entity to replace oil consumed for a RUC-Committed Interval.  In addition, the QSE must provide proof that the Resource actually consumed fuel oil during the RUC-Committed Interval.  Proof of actual consumption may be based on the Resource\u2019s technical specifications or flow meters as appropriate.  Documentation of fuel oil purchases must show that these were made no later than seven Business Days after the end of the last consecutive RUC-Committed Interval.  Replacement fuel oil costs are limited to the actual gallons/barrels of fuel oil consumed during RUC-Committed Intervals.\n(9)\tERCOT may, in its sole discretion, consider documentation types other than those specifically listed in paragraphs (1) and (8) above when offered by a QSE in support of its recovery of fuel costs for RUC deployments.  For example, ERCOT may require the Resource input-output equation or average heat rate curve that allows for verification of fuel consumption for operation at and above LSL.\n(10)\tWhen calculating the RUC Guarantee as described in paragraph (1), (6) or (7) above, the Startup Price per start (SUPR) and the Minimum-Energy Price (MEPR), as defined in paragraph (6) of Section 5.7.1.1, RUC Guarantee, will be set to the Startup Cap (SUCAP) and Minimum-Energy Cap (MECAP), respectively, utilizing the actual fuel price paid.\n(11)\tIn order to recover fuel costs above LSL for a RUC-Committed Interval, the QSE must also submit proof of the volume-weighted average actual price paid for fuel consumed by the Resource during a RUC-Committed Interval for generation above LSL.  ERCOT will adjust the RUC Guarantee (RUCG) to include the additional fuel costs above LSL filed by the QSE.\n[NPRR1140: Replace paragraph (11) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(11)\tIn order to recover fuel costs above LSL for a RUC-Committed Interval, the QSE must also submit proof of the volume-weighted average actual price paid for fuel consumed by the Resource during a RUC-Committed Interval for generation above LSL.  \n9.14.8\tDisputes for Settlement Application of Integrated Telemetry for Split Generation Resources\n(1)\tSettlement and billing disputes related to application of integrated Real-Time telemetry of MW or MVAr from a Generation Resource that has been split to function as two or more Split Generation Resources require a signed affidavit by all QSEs representing associated Split Generation Resources.  Data values submitted with the affidavit must be integrated to the applicable Settlement Interval format related to the Settlement and billing charge type in dispute.\n9.14.9\tIncremental Fuel Costs for Switchable Generation Make-Whole Payment Disputes \n(1)\tFor the purposes of any Settlement and billing dispute submitted pursuant to paragraph (1)(c) of Section 6.6.12, Make-Whole Payment for Switchable Generation Resources Committed for Energy Emergency Alert (EEA), if the actual price paid for delivered natural gas for a specific Switchable Generation Resource (SWGR) for an instructed hour is greater than FIP plus the fuel adder, then the QSE may recover the fuel costs incurred for that SWGR in the Settlement and billing dispute.  The QSE must provide documentation (invoices) that identifies intra-day costs of natural gas consumed.  All documentation submitted by the QSE for natural gas costs incurred intra-day must show a nexus from the seller or distributor of natural gas products to the QSE, Resource Entity or Generation Entity as the ultimate buyer.  The QSE must demonstrate that the seller or distributor has procured natural gas fuel intra-day.  \n(2)\tFor the purposes of any Settlement and billing dispute submitted pursuant to paragraph (1)(c) of Section 6.6.12, if the actual price paid for the delivered fuel oil used to replace oil consumed for an instructed hour is greater than FOP plus the fuel adder, then the QSE may recover the fuel costs incurred for that SWGR in the dispute.  The QSE must provide documentation that identifies purchases of fuel oil by the QSE, Resource Entity, or Generation Entity to replace oil consumed.  In addition, the QSE must provide proof that the SWGR actually consumed fuel oil for the instructed hour.  Proof of actual consumption may be based on the Resource\u2019s technical specifications or flow meters as appropriate.  Documentation of fuel oil purchases must show that these were made no later than seven Business Days after the end of the last consecutive instructed hour. \n(3)\tA QSE submitting documents for the recovery of RUC-related fuel costs other than those specifically discussed in paragraph (1) or (2) above must request to have such documents approved by the ERCOT Board during an Executive Session at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the ERCOT Board.  If the ERCOT Board approves the inclusion of such documentation as proof of fuel purchases, the QSE must file an NPRR in accordance with Section 21, Revision Request Process, to add this category of documentation to the process for approval of Switchable Generation Make-Whole Payments.\n9.14.10\tSettlement for Market Participants Impacted by Omitted Procedures or Manual Actions to Resolve the DAM \n(1)\tA Market Participant that has been directly impacted by an action or omission by ERCOT to resolve the DAM, as described in paragraph (4) of Section 4.1.2, Day-Ahead Process and Timing Deviations, may seek recovery by filing a Settlement and billing dispute as defined in Section 9.14.  Where ERCOT determines that the Market Participant seeking recovery has been directly impacted by such ERCOT action or omission, the following provisions apply:\n(a)\tNo resettlement of the DAM will occur as a result of a Market Participant\u2019s recovery under this Section;\n(b)\tWhere a Market Participant\u2019s submissions were not cleared in the DAM, ERCOT will establish a set of DAM Energy Bids, DAM Energy Offers, Ancillary Service Offers, and Point-to-Point (PTP) bids that would have cleared given the settled prices of the DAM;\n[NPRR1245:  Replace paragraph (b) above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]\n(b)\tWhere a Market Participant\u2019s submissions were not cleared in the DAM, ERCOT will establish a set of DAM Energy Bids, DAM Energy Offers, Resource-Specific Ancillary Service Offers, Ancillary Service Only Offers, and Point-to-Point (PTP) bids that would have cleared given the settled prices of the DAM;",

SUBST. R. 25.131, Load Profiling and Load Research, requires that ERCOT establish and implement a process to collect a fee from any Retail Electric Provider (REP) who seeks to assign customers to a non-ERCOT sponsored profile segment.  The process must include a method for other REPs who use the profile segment to compensate the original requestor of the new profile segment and for ERCOT to notify Distribution Service Providers (DSPs) which REPs are authorized to use the new profile segment.  This profile development cost recovery fee is overseen by ERCOT.\n(2)\tWithin 30 days after a profile segment receives final approval from ERCOT, the requestor shall submit to ERCOT documentation of the costs it incurred in developing the profile segment change request.  All such documentation must be available for review by any Market Participant.  Any costs submitted more than 30 days after approval of the profile segment will not be recoverable.  Recoverable costs must be directly attributable to the creation of the profile segment change request, incurred no earlier than 24 months preceding the original submission date of the profile segment change request, and must be further limited to:\n(a)\tCosts for Load research as paid to DSPs or ERCOT, documented by a copy of all DSP or ERCOT Invoices or other evidence of payment, including but not limited to:\n(i)\tBuying and installing Interval Data Recorders (IDRs);\n(ii)\tInstalling communication equipment such as phone lines or cell phones; and\n(iii)\tReading the meters and translating the data.\n(b)\tReasonable costs paid to third parties, including a copy of all third-party invoices or other documentary evidence of payment, including:\n(i)\tDefining the request, such as identifying population, profile, data, etc.;\n(ii)\tPreparing the request, such as collecting and analyzing data and presenting the case; and\n(iii)\tUndertaking the review process such as meeting with ERCOT, Profiling Working Group (PWG), Retail Market Subcommittee (RMS), Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), and the ERCOT Board.\n(c)\tRequestor\u2019s reasonable internal documented costs itemizing all persons, hours, and other expenses associated with developing the request per paragraphs (1) and (2) above.\n(3)\tWithin 60 days after ERCOT approves a profile segment, ERCOT shall evaluate the costs submitted and shall disallow any costs not meeting these criteria.  The remaining costs must comprise the total reimbursable cost.  Within the same 60-day period, ERCOT shall post a report on the ERCOT website summarizing the allowed expenses by paragraphs (1) and (2) above.  If a Market Participant, including the requestor, disagrees with the ERCOT determination with respect to the total reimbursable cost, the Market Participant may submit a dispute as outlined in Section 20, Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedure and Procedure for Return of Settlement Funds.  No disputes may be submitted after 45 days from posting of the total reimbursable cost to the ERCOT website. \n(4)\tThe fee is calculated as follows:\nIf a REP is the requestor, then:  FEE = $C / n\nIf the requestor is not a REP, then:\nFEE = $C / (n + 1)\nThe above variables are defined as follows:\nVariable\tDefinition\nn\tThe number of REPs subscribing to the profile segment\n$C\tThe total reimbursable cost\n(5)\tThe fee must be paid by each successive subscribing REP to the requestor and any previous subscribing REPs per instructions and validation by ERCOT.  As additional REPs subscribe to the profile segment, the fee is recalculated and reallocated equally among all subscribing REPs and the requestor, if the requestor is not a REP.\n(6)\tBeginning four years after the date on which the profile segment becomes available for Settlement, any REP may request assignment of Electric Service Identifiers (ESI IDs) to the profile segment without being assessed the profile development cost recovery fee.\n9.19\tPartial Payments by Invoice Recipients\n(1)\tIf at least one Invoice Recipient owing funds does not pay its Settlement Invoice in full (short-pay), ERCOT shall follow the procedure set forth below:\n(a)\tERCOT shall make every reasonable attempt to collect payment from each short-paying Invoice Recipient prior to four hours preceding the close of the Bank Business Day Central Prevailing Time (CPT) on the day that payments by ERCOT are due to be paid to applicable Invoice Recipient(s). \n(b)\tERCOT shall draw on any available Financial Security pledged to ERCOT by each short-paying Invoice Recipient that did not pay the amount due under paragraph (a) above.  If the amount of any such draw is greater than the amount of the short-paying Invoice Recipient\u2019s cash collateral held in excess of that required to cover its Total Potential Exposure (TPE) (\u201cExcess Collateral\u201d), then a draw on available security for a short-paying Invoice Recipient shall be considered a Late Payment for purposes of Section 16.11.6, Payment Breach and Late Payments by Market Participants.  ERCOT may, in its sole discretion, hold up to 5% of Financial Security of each short-paying Invoice Recipient and use those funds to pay subsequent Settlement Invoices as they become due.  Any funds still held will be applied to unpaid Invoices in conjunction with the default uplift process outlined in Section 9.19.1, Default Uplift Invoices.\n(c)\tERCOT shall offset or recoup any amounts owed, or to be owed, by ERCOT to a short-paying Invoice Recipient against amounts not paid by that Invoice Recipient, and ERCOT shall apply the amount offset or recouped to cover short pays by that Invoice Recipient.  ERCOT may, in its sole discretion, hold credit Invoices and use those funds to pay subsequent Settlement Invoices as they become due.  Any funds still held will be offset or recouped against unpaid Invoices in conjunction with the default uplift process outlined in Section 9.19.1.\n(d)\tIf, after taking the actions set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, ERCOT still does not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts that it owes to Settlement Invoice Recipients in full, ERCOT shall deduct any applicable administrative fees as specified in Section 9.16, ERCOT System Administration and User Fees, payments for Reliability Must-Run (RMR) Services, and the Congestion Revenue Right (CRR) Balancing Account (CRRBA) from the amount received or collected and then reduce payments to all Settlement Invoice Recipients owed monies from ERCOT.  The reductions must be based on a pro rata basis of monies owed to each Settlement Invoice Recipient, to the extent necessary to clear ERCOT\u2019s accounts on the payment due date to achieve revenue neutrality for ERCOT.  ERCOT shall provide to all Market Participants payment details on all short pays and subsequent reimbursements of short pays.  Details must include the identity of each short-paying Invoice Recipient and the dollar amount attributable to that Invoice Recipient, broken down by Invoice numbers.  In addition, ERCOT shall provide the aggregate total of all amounts due to all Invoice Recipients before applying the amount not paid on the Settlement Invoice.\n(e)\tIf sufficient funds continue to be unavailable for ERCOT to pay all amounts in full to short-paid Entities for that Settlement Invoice and the short-paying Entity is not complying with a payment plan designed to enable ERCOT to pay all amounts in full to short-paid Entities, ERCOT shall uplift short-paid amounts through the Default Uplift process described below in Section 9.19.1 and Section 9.19.2, Payment Process for Default Uplift Invoices.\n(f)\tWhen ERCOT enters into a payment plan with a short-pay Invoice Recipient, ERCOT shall post to the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area:\n(i)\tThe short-pay plan;\n(ii)\tThe schedule of quantifiable expected payments, updated if and when modifications are made to the payment schedule; and\n(iii)\tInvoice dates to which the payments will be applied.\n[NPRR1239:  Replace paragraph (f) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(f)\tWhen ERCOT enters into a payment plan with a short-pay Invoice Recipient, ERCOT shall post to the ERCOT website:\n(i)\tThe short-pay plan;\n(ii)\tThe schedule of quantifiable expected payments, updated if and when modifications are made to the payment schedule; and\n(iii)\tInvoice dates to which the payments will be applied.\n(g)\tTo the extent ERCOT is able to collect past due funds owed by a short-paying Invoice Recipient before the default uplift process defined in Section 9.19.1, ERCOT shall allocate the collected funds to the earliest short-paid Invoice for that short-paying Invoice Recipient.  ERCOT shall use its best efforts to distribute collected funds quarterly by the 15th Business Day following the end of a calendar quarter for a short paying Entity when the cumulative amount of undistributed funds held exceed $50,000 on a pro rata basis of monies owed.  Subsequently collected funds that have not previously been distributed will be applied against unpaid Invoices in conjunction with the uplift process outlined in Section 9.19.1. \n(h)\tTo the extent ERCOT is able to collect past due funds owed by a short-paying Invoice Recipient, after the default uplift process defined in Section 9.19.1, ERCOT shall allocate the collected funds using the same allocation method as in the default uplift process.  ERCOT shall use its best efforts to distribute subsequently collected funds quarterly by the 15th Business Day following the end of a calendar quarter for a short paying Entity when the cumulative amount of undistributed funds held exceed $50,000.\n9.19.1\tDefault Uplift Invoices\n(1)\tERCOT shall collect the total short-pay amount for all Settlement Invoices for a month, less the total payments expected from a payment plan, from Qualified Scheduling Entities (QSEs) and CRR Account Holders.  ERCOT must pay the funds it collects from payments on Default Uplift Invoices to the Entities previously short-paid.  ERCOT shall notify those Entities of the details of the payment.\n(2)\tEach Counter-Party\u2019s share of the uplift is calculated using the best available Settlement data for each Operating Day in the month prior to the month in which the default occurred (the \u201creference month\u201d), and is calculated as follows:\nDURSCPcp = TSPA * MMARScp\nWhere:\nMMARS cp = MMA cp / MMATOT\nMMA cp = Max { \u2211mp (URTMG mp + URTDCIMP mp + USOGTOT mp), \n\u2211mp (URTAML mp + UWSLTOT mp), \n\u2211mp URTQQES mp, \n\u2211mp URTQQEP mp, \n\u2211mp UDAES mp, \n\u2211mp UDAEP mp,\n\u2211mp (URTOBL mp + URTOBLLO mp), \n\u2211mp (UDAOPT mp + UDAOBL mp + UOPTS mp + UOBLS mp), \n\u2211mp (UOPTP mp + UOBLP mp)}\n[NPRR995, NPRR1012, and NPRR1201:  Replace applicable portions of the formula \u201cMMA cp\u201d above with the following upon system implementation for NPRR995 or NPRR1201; or upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project for NPRR1012:]\nMMA cp = Max { \u2211mp (URTMG mp + URTDCIMP mp + USOGTOT mp), \n\u2211mp (URTAML mp + UWSLTOT mp + USOCLTOT mp), \n\u2211mp URTQQES mp, \n\u2211mp URTQQEP mp, \n\u2211mp UDAES mp, \n\u2211mp UDAEP mp,\n\u2211mp (URTOBL mp + URTOBLLO mp), \n\u2211mp (UDAOPT mp + UDAOBL mp), \n\u2211mp UDAASOAWD mp}\nMMATOT = \u2211cp (MMAcp)\nWhere:\nURTMG mp = \u2211p, r, i (RTMG mp, p, r, i), excluding RTMG for RMR Resources and RTMG in Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC)-Committed Intervals for RUC-committed Resources\nURTDCIMP mp = \u2211p, i (RTDCIMP mp, p, i) / 4\nURTAML mp = max(0,\u2211p, i (RTAML mp, p, i))\nURTQQES mp = \u2211p, i (RTQQES mp, p, i) / 4\nURTQQEP mp = \u2211p, i (RTQQEP mp, p, i) / 4\nUDAES mp = \u2211p, h (DAES mp, p, h)\nUDAEP mp = \u2211p, h (DAEP mp, p, h)\nURTOBL mp = \u2211(j, k), h (RTOBL mp, (j, k), h)\nURTOBLLO mp = \u2211(j, k), h (RTOBLLO mp, (j, k), h)\nUDAOPT mp = \u2211(j, k), h (DAOPT mp, (j, k), h)\nUDAOBL mp = \u2211(j, k), h (DAOBL mp, (j, k), h)\nUOPTS mp = \u2211(j, k), h (OPTS mp, (j, k), h) \nUOBLS mp = \u2211(j, k), h (OBLS mp, (j, k), h)\nUOPTP mp = \u2211(j, k), h (OPTP mp, j, h)\nUOBLP mp = \u2211(j, k), h (OBLP mp, (j, k), h)\n[NPRR1201:  Delete the formulas \u201cUOPTS mp\u201d, \u201cUOBLS mp\u201d, \u201cUOPTP mp\u201d, and \u201cUOBLP mp\u201d above upon system implementation.]\nUWSLTOT mp = (-1) * \u2211r, b (MEBL mp, r, b)\n[NPRR1012:  Insert the formula \u201cUDAASOAWD mp\u201d below upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]\nUDAASOAWD mp  = \u2211h (DARUOAWD mp, h  + DARDOAWD mp, h + DARROAWD mp, h + DANSOAWD mp, h + DAECROAWD mp, h )\nUSOGTOT mp = \u2211gsc (MEBSOGNET mp, gsc) + \u2211 p, i (RTMGSOGZ mp, p, i)",

Collection of data from EPS metered Entities will be done via the Meter Data Acquisition System (MDAS).  This data will be validated, edited, estimated, adjusted, netted, loss corrected, split, and aggregated as necessary to provide the required Settlement inputs.\n11.1.2\tERCOT Polled Settlement Meter Data Collection\n(1)\tERCOT will perform remote interrogation of EPS metered Entities to provide the necessary data for the Settlement process.  Upon initiation of connection with the meter, the MDAS will verify that the meter\u2019s internal Interval Data Recorder (IDR) protocol (Translation Interface Module setting) and the device identifier programmed into the IDR match the master file database stored in the MDAS.  If remote-polling fails for any reason, ERCOT will work closely with the Transmission Service Provider (TSP) and/or Distribution Service Provider (DSP) to resolve data collection problems within the time frame defined in Section 10, Metering.\n11.1.3\tERCOT Polled Settlement Meter Time Synchronization\n(1)\tERCOT will update the clock of any EPS meter that falls outside the threshold defined in Section 10, Metering of these Protocols.  ERCOT will notify the TSP and/or DSP regarding any meter that is determined to be inconsistent in its timekeeping function.  The TSP and/or DSP will facilitate correction of this problem within the time frame detailed in Section 10.\n11.1.4\tERCOT Polled Settlement Meter Data Validation, Editing, and Estimation\n(1)\tAfter EPS time synchronization has been completed and interval meter data has been retrieved, ERCOT will determine if the data is valid.  The validation process will include, but not be limited to, the following tests:\n(a)\tFlagging of intervals with missing data;\n(b)\tException reporting if the total number of zero values for any channel exceeds the tolerance limit;\n(c)\tException reporting if the total number of power outage intervals exceeds the tolerance limit;\n(d)\tChannel level exception reporting if any single interval breaches the upper or lower threshold of the limit;\n(e)\tChannel level validation of the percent change between two consecutive intervals being greater than the established tolerance limit;\n(f)\tData overlap validation test, which rejects validations when the current interrogation of data overlaps data previously collected;\n(g)\tChannel level energy tolerance test, which reports exceptions of total energy accumulated from the interval data not being equivalent to the energy calculated from the meter register\u2019s start and stop readings;\n(h)\tValidation that the number of expected intervals equals the number of actual intervals collected during the interrogation process; and\n(i)\tValidation of data between primary, backup and check meters where available.\n(2)\tERCOT will perform editing and estimation of EPS meter data according to Section 10, Metering.  The validation process occurs each time data is collected from a meter.\n11.1.5\tLoss Compensation of ERCOT Polled Settlement Meter Data\n(1)\tAdjustments will be made to actual metered consumption to accommodate the energy consumption related to line and transformation losses to the Point of Interconnection (POI) with the ERCOT Transmission Grid in accordance with Section 10.3.2.2, Loss Compensation of EPS Meter Data.  These adjustments are intended specifically to correct the metered consumption when the meter is not located at the POI with the ERCOT Transmission Grid.\n(2)\tThe preferred method for loss compensation and correction is by programming of the meter.  Recognizing that some meters may not have the ability to perform internal compensation computations, ERCOT\u2019s Data Aggregation System (DAS) will have the ability to perform approved loss compensation as necessary.\n(3)\tTSPs and/or DSPs requesting loss compensation for a specific meter will comply with Section 10, Metering, and the Settlement Metering Operating Guide (SMOG).  ERCOT will provide a compensation mechanism based upon a single percentage value submitted by the TSP and/or DSP and approved by ERCOT.  The loss compensation percentage value will remain in place and will be applied to all intervals of data until such time as the TSP and/or DSP submits, and ERCOT approves, revised loss compensation values.  The loss compensation percentage values should not be changed more than once annually.\n11.1.6\tERCOT-Polled Settlement Meter Netting\n(1)\tAs allowed by Section 10, Metering, of these Protocols, ERCOT will perform the approved netting schemes, which sum the meters at a given Generation Resource or Energy Storage Resource (ESR) site.  \n(2)\tBoth Load consumption and generation production meters will be combined together to obtain a total amount of Load or generation.\n(3)\tFor an ESR site with Wholesale Storage Load (WSL):\n[NPRR995:  Replace paragraph (3) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(3)\tFor an ESR site:\n(a)\tWSL is measured by the corresponding EPS Meter, except that when a Resource Entity for an ESR communicates its auxiliary Load value to the EPS Meter, WSL is calculated by subtracting the auxiliary Load from the total Load measured by the corresponding EPS Meter.  If the calculated auxiliary Load is greater than the total Load, WSL shall be zero. \n(b)\tFor WSL that is metered behind the POI metering point, the WSL will be added back into the POI metering point to determine the net flows for the POI metering point.\n(c)\tFor WSL that is separately metered at the POI, the WSL will not be included in the determination of whether the generation site is net generation or net Load for the purpose of Settlement.\n(4)\tFor an ESR that has separately metered its charging Load, but elects not to receive WSL treatment, the Non-WSL ESR Charging Load for the 15-minute interval shall be determined using the metered ESR charging Load.\n[NPRR1188:  Replace paragraph (4) above with the following upon system implementation:]\n(4)\tFor a single POI Generation Resource site that includes an ESR whose charging Load is not receiving WSL treatment or includes a Controllable Load Resource (CLR):\n(a)\tThe portion of Non-WSL ESR Charging Load or CLR Load supplied from the grid will be adjusted for Distribution Losses, Transmission Losses, and Unaccounted for Energy (UFE);\n(b)\tThe portion of Non-WSL ESR Charging Load or CLR Load supplied from the co-located generation will not be adjusted for Distribution Losses, Transmission Losses, and UFE;\n(c)\tFor RTAML, 4-CP, and Load Ratio Share (LRS) volumes, only the Non-WSL ESR Charging Load or CLR Load supplied from the grid (after loss and UFE adjustment) shall be included;\n(d)\tFor Section 6.6.3.1, Real-Time Energy Imbalance Payment or Charge at a Resource Node, (the Non-WSL ESR Charging Load or CLR Load shall be the Load supplied from the grid (after loss and UFE adjustment) plus the Non-WSL ESR Charging Load or CLR Load supplied from the co-located generation;\n(e)\tAn Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID) is required for each ESR and CLR and the unadjusted energy supplied from the grid will be allocated to each ESI ID.\n(f)\tFor sites with multiple ESRs or CLRs, the unadjusted energy supplied from the grid will be allocated to each ESI ID based upon load ratio share using metered Non-WSL ESR Charging Load or CLR Load or calculated Non-WSL ESR Charging Load; and\n(g)\tFor a single POI Generation Resource site that includes an ESR that has separately metered its charging Load, the Non-WSL ESR Charging Load for the 15-minute interval shall be determined using the metered ESR Charging Load.\n(5)\tFor an ESR that has not separately metered its charging Load, or has forfeited WSL treatment pursuant to paragraph (3) of Section 10.2.4, Resource Entity Calculation and Telemetry of ESR Auxiliary Load Values, the Non-WSL ESR Charging Load for the 15-minute interval shall be equal to the total metered ESR Load minus auxiliary Load, where auxiliary Load is calculated as the greater of the following:\n(a)\tThe lesser of the total metered ESR Load or X MWh, where X is calculated as 15% of the ESR\u2019s nameplate capacity multiplied by 0.25; or\n(b)\t15% of the total metered ESR Load for the 15-minute interval.\n[NPRR1188:  Insert paragraph (6) below upon system implementation and renumber accordingly:]\n(6)\tFor a single POI Generation Resource site that includes a CLR, CLR Load shall be metered with an EPS Meter and the metered energy will be considered as Generation Resource production to determine the net flows for Settlement of the corresponding generation site.",

At the Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID) level, the TSP and/or DSP will be notified of successful and unsuccessful validations;\n(b)\tValidate that the correct TSP and/or DSP is submitting meter consumption data on an individual ESI ID basis.  At the ESI ID level, the TSP and/or DSP will be notified of unsuccessful validations;  \n(c)\tProvide a report to the TSP and/or DSP listing each ESI ID for which ERCOT has not received consumption data for 38 days; and\n(d)\tSynchronize the Data Aggregation System (DAS) data with the Customer registration system on a daily basis to ensure the appropriate relationship between the ESI ID, Load Serving Entity (LSE) and/or Resource Entity, and the meter.  DAS will provide versioning to ensure ESI ID characteristic changes are time stamped.\n11.3\tElectric Service Identifier Synchronization\n11.3.1\tElectric Service Identifier Service History and Usage\n(1)\tOn a daily basis, ERCOT shall provide incremental updates to Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID) service history and usage information to Load Serving Entities (LSEs), Meter Reading Entities (MREs), and Transmission Service Providers (TSPs) and/or Distribution Service Providers (DSPs).  ESI ID service history includes ESI ID relationships and ESI ID characteristics.\n11.3.2\tVariance Process\n(1)\tAny LSE, MRE, TSP or DSP that contests the accuracy of ESI ID service history and usage information maintained by ERCOT shall file a variance in the manner specified by the Retail Market Guide.

The process of aggregating Load data provides the determinants that allow the Settlement to occur.\n11.4.1\tEstimation of Missing Data\n(1)\tThe Data Aggregation System (DAS) will perform estimation of missing interval and non-interval retail Load meter consumption data for use in Settlement when actual meter consumption data is unavailable.\n11.4.2\tNon-Interval Missing Consumption Data Estimation\n(1)\tThe DAS will distinguish each Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID) for which consumption data has not been received for the Operating Day.  Non-interval ESI ID locations for which no actual consumption exists for the specified Operating Day will be pre-aggregated by like components which may include but are not limited to the following sets:\n(a)\tQSE;\n(b)\tLSE;\n(c)\tSettlement Point;\n(d)\tUFE zone;\n(e)\tProfile ID;\n(f)\tDLF code;\n(g)\tTransmission Service Provider (TSP) and /or Distribution Service Provider (DSP);\n(h)\tRead start date (reading from date); and\n(i)\tRead stop date (reading to date).\n(2)\tEstimates of missing data are based on Profile ID, which includes:\n(a)\tLoad Profile Type;\n(b)\tWeather Zone;\n(c)\tMeter type;\n(d)\tWeather sensitivity; and\n(e)\tTime Of Use Schedule (TOUS).\n(3)\tProfile application will take aggregated non-interval consumption data and apply the Load Profile in order to create interval consumption data.  Profiled non-interval data is calculated by dividing the aggregated ESI ID\u2019s total kWh for a specific time period (usually a month) by the profile class\u2019 kWh for the same specific time period and scaling the Load Profile for that same specific Operating Day by the resulting value to provide the profiled non-interval consumption data.\nPND Operating Day \t=\t(\uf053Actual KWH Specific Time Period / \uf053CP KWH Specific Time Period) * LP Operating Day\nThe above variables are defined as follows:\nVariable\tUnit\tDescription\nPND\t\tProfiled non-interval data.\nCP\t\tClass profile.\nLP\tkWh\tLoad Profile (daily interval data set).",

The method for estimating interval data for ESI IDs with IDR Meters is a \u201cWeather Response Informed Proxy Day\u201d technique.  This approach seeks to increase estimation accuracy by segmenting ESI IDs with IDR Meters into two groups based on a known indicator of Load (i.e., weather).  The classification of ESI IDs with IDR Meters into a Weather Sensitive (WS) group and a Non-Weather Sensitive (NWS) group determines the proxy day method used for estimation purposes.  The proxy day estimation method for each group captures the factors that best predict the ESI ID-specific Load shape for the Operating Day.\n(2)\tThe NWS proxy day method will be used for estimating interval data for IDRs where the profile type code is BUSLRG or BUSLRGDG.\n(3)\tThe WS proxy day method will be used for estimating interval data for IDRs where the profile type code is not BUSIDRRQ, BUSLRG, or BUSLRGDG.\n11.4.3.1\tWeather Sensitive Proxy Day Method\n(1)\tFor ESI IDs estimated as Weather Sensitive IDR (WSIDR), ERCOT will use this WS proxy day method.  ESI IDs within the same Weather Zone will be grouped together.  The proxy days will be the same for all ESI IDs within each of the Weather Zones.  This method incorporates the following:\n(a)\tTo determine eligible proxy days, select all days (of matching weekday/weekend day type and time period) within five degrees of the maximum temperature of the target Operating Day based on the previous 365 days and then limit the selection to those days that have their maximum temperatures occurring within two hours of the maximum temperature hour of occurrence of the Operating Day.  The maximum temperature separation criterion provides initial assurance that the eligible day will have a similar diurnal temperature pattern as the target Settlement Operating Day.\n(b)\tPerform two tests on each potential proxy day identified in item (a) above:\n(i)\tTemperature magnitude test sums the squared differences between the hourly temperatures of the target Operating Day and the hourly temperatures of the potential proxy day; and\n(ii)\tTemperature shape test calculates the incremental change in temperature from hour to hour during the day and sums the squared differences between the corresponding values of the target Operating Day and the potential proxy day.\n(c)\tEach potential proxy day for each test described in item (b) above is ranked in ascending order based on the sum of squared differences.\n(d)\tA final ranking is performed with the temperature magnitude test weighted more heavily than the shape test.  The weighting factors are 70% and 30%.\n(e)\tSelect the top three ranked eligible days.\n(f)\tFor each ESI ID, do the following:\n(i)\tUse the top ranked proxy day for the target Operating Day, if available;\n(ii)\tIf the top ranked proxy day data is not available, use the second ranked proxy day data as the estimate;\n(iii)\tIf the second ranked proxy day data is not available, use the third proxy day; and\n(iv)\tIf no data is available for any of the proxy days selected, then default to the NWS proxy day method.\n11.4.3.2\tNon-Weather Sensitive Proxy Day Method\n(1)\tFor ESI IDs estimated as Non-Weather Sensitive IDR (NWSIDR), ERCOT will use this NWS proxy day method.  This method incorporates the following:\n(a)\tUse the most recent proxy day for which data is available as the estimate for the target Operating Day.  From historical ESI ID specific interval data, choose the most recent occurrence of the appropriate day of the week (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday) corresponding to the day of the week of the Operating Day (holidays are treated as Sundays) within the most recent 12 months of the Operating Day; or\n(b)\tIf there is no historic interval data available according to item (a) above, the IDR data will be estimated using the default profile assigned to the ESI ID for the Operating Day.  If non-interval consumption data with a meter read within 12 months of the Operating Day is available, and if the ESI ID was profiled with a non-interval meter data type code within 90 days of the Operating Day, the default profile shall be estimated and/or scaled in accordance with Section 11.4.2, Non-Interval Missing Consumption Data Estimation.\n11.4.3.3\tInterval Data Recorder Estimation Reporting\n(1)\tERCOT shall produce a report detailing the proxy day selection list for both NWSIDR and WSIDR methodologies.  This report will be made available to Market Participants on a daily basis.\n11.4.4\tData Aggregation Processing for Actual Data\n(1)\tThe DAS will apply backcasted profiles to aggregated actual non-interval consumption data for use in Settlement when actual meter consumption data is available.  IDR ESI IDs for which actual data exists will be used directly in the Data Aggregation process.\n11.4.4.1\tApplication of Profiles to Non-Interval Data\n(1)\tNon-Interval ESI ID locations for which actual consumption exists for the specified Operating Day will be pre-aggregated by like components which may include but are not limited to the following sets:\n(a)\tQSE;\n(b)\tLSE;\n(c)\tSettlement Point;\n(d)\tUFE zone;\n(e)\tProfile ID;\n(f)\tDLF code;\n(g)\tTSP and/or DSP;\n(h)\tRead start date (reading from date); and\n(i)\tRead stop date (reading to date).\n(2)\tProfile application will take aggregated non-interval consumption data and apply the Load Profile in order to create interval consumption data.  Profiled non-interval data is calculated by dividing the aggregated ESI ID\u2019s total kWh for a specific time period (usually a month) by the profile class\u2019 kWh for the same specific time period and scaling the Load Profile for that same specific Operating Day by the resulting value to provide the profiled non-interval consumption data.\nPND Operating Day\t=\t(\uf053Actual KWH Specific Time Period / \uf053CP KWH Specific Time Period) * LP Operating Day\nThe above variables are defined as follows:\nVariable\tUnit\tDescription\nPND\t\tProfiled non-interval data.\nCP\t\tClass profile.\nLP\tkWh\tLoad Profile (daily interval data set).\n\n11.4.4.2\tLoad Reduction for Excess PhotoVoltaic and Wind Distributed Renewable Generation \n(1)\tAdjusted Metered Load (AML) for ESI IDs with PhotoVoltaic (PV) generation shall be adjusted as follows:\nFor ESI IDs with non-IDRs installed, AML shall be reduced for excess generation from ESI IDs with PV generation equal to or lower than the Distributed Generation (DG) registration threshold behind the meter where there is a meter that measures excess energy flow into the ERCOT System in a separate register.

ERCOT shall allocate T&D Losses to Load at the appropriate aggregate level as part of the data aggregation process to calculate the Load obligation of QSEs for settlement purposes.\n(2)\tERCOT shall forecast Transmission Loss Factors (TLFs) and post them to the ERCOT website by 0600 of the Day-Ahead period.  ERCOT shall forecast the ERCOT-wide TLFs as a percentage of Load for each Settlement Interval of the Operating Day.  By the close of business on the day following the Operating Day, ERCOT shall also calculate Actual TLFs using the actual system Load and shall post the resulting Actual TLFs to the settlement system and the ERCOT website.\n(3)\tERCOT shall forecast Settlement Interval Distribution Loss Factors (DLFs) and post them to the ERCOT website by 0600 of the Day Ahead period.  ERCOT shall forecast the Settlement Interval DLFs as a percentage of Load for each Settlement Interval of the Operating Day.  On the day following the Operating Day, ERCOT shall also calculate Settlement Interval DLFs using actual system Load for that Settlement Interval and post the resulting deemed actual Settlement Interval DLFs to the settlement system and the ERCOT website.\n(4)\tDistribution loss coefficients, and the calculation methodology from which they are derived, will be subject to audit by ERCOT for accurate and consistent application.  Non-Opt-in Entities (NOIEs) with Interval Data Recorders (IDRs) at the settlement point of delivery are not required to provide Distribution loss coefficients and calculation methodology.\n(5)\tIn the special case where there are distribution facilities upstream from a wholesale NOIE or External Load Serving Entity (ELSE) settlement IDR, that settlement IDR will be compensated for line and transformer losses between the IDR and the ERCOT Transmission Grid to account for the Distribution Losses.  The NOIE or ELSE will then be treated as a transmission level NOIE or ELSE.  Calculations are subject to review by ERCOT.  Since loss compensation is included in the wholesale settlement IDR, the TSP and/or DSP providing upstream wheeling facilities may need to offer wholesale wheeling tariffs excluding the losses for which compensation has already been provided.\n13.1.2\tCalculation of Losses for Settlement\n(1)\tERCOT shall use the deemed actual Settlement Interval DLFs applicable to each Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID) and the Actual TLFs when adjusting aggregated Load for losses to determine the QSE total Load obligations.\n13.2\tTransmission Losses\n13.2.1\tForecasted Transmission Loss Factors\n(1)\tThe forecasted Transmission Loss Factor (TLF) for each interval in the Operating Day shall be a linear interpolation or extrapolation using the on-peak and the off-peak TLFs and the corresponding forecast of ERCOT System Load during the same interval to calculate the loss factors.\n(2)\tAt 0600 of the Day-Ahead period, ERCOT shall forecast a TLF for each Settlement Interval of the Operating Day and post on the ERCOT website the forecasted TLFs which correspond to the Operating Day forecast.  The source of the on-peak and off-peak losses are the ERCOT load flow base cases for the applicable season.  For the purpose of Section 13.2, Transmission Losses, \u201cseason\u201d is defined as those set forth in item (1) of Section 13.2.4, Seasonal On-Peak and Off-Peak Transmission Loss Factor Calculation.\n13.2.2\tActual Transmission Loss Factors\n(1)\tERCOT shall determine the Actual TLF for each interval in the Operating Day by dividing the sum of line and transformer MW losses by the total ERCOT Load as determined by the State Estimator in the Energy Management System (EMS).\n(2)\tThe day after the Operating Day, ERCOT shall publish Actual TLFs to be used in Settlement calculations.\n13.2.3\tForecasted Transmission Loss Factor Calculations\n(1)\tThe following formulas shall be used to translate the Seasonal On-Peak and Off-Peak TLFs into forecasted Settlement Interval TLFs.\nTLF i\t=\t(SSC * SIEL i) + SIC\nVariable\tUnit\tDescription\ni\tnone\tInterval\nTLF i\tnone\tTransmission Loss Factor for a Settlement Interval\nSIEL i\tMWh\tSettlement Interval ERCOT System Load (forecasted)\nSSC\tnone\tSeasonal Slope Coefficient\nSIC\tnone\tSeasonal Intercept Coefficient\nWhere\n\tSSC \t=\t(SONLF \u2013 SOFFLF) / (SONL \u2013 SOFFL)\n\tSIC\t=\t[(SOFFLF * SONL) \u2013 (SONLF * SOFFL)] / (SONL \u2013 SOFFL)\nVariable\tUnit\tDescription\nSONLF\tnone\tSeasonal on-peak percent loss factor \nSOFFLF\tnone\tSeasonal off-peak percent loss factor \nSONL\tnone\tSeasonal on-peak Load value\nSOFFL\tnone\tSeasonal off-peak Load value\n13.2.4\tSeasonal On-Peak and Off-Peak Transmission Loss Factor Calculation\n(1)\tSeasonal On-Peak and Off-Peak TLFs are derived from the annually updated ERCOT on-peak and off-peak load flow base cases analysis by ERCOT.

ERCOT shall base the number of RECs to be issued on the MWh generation data provided by REC generators or ERCOT as applicable.  The number of RECs issued to a specific REC generator will be equal to the number of MWh generated by the certified generator during the quarter.  Quarterly production shall be rounded to the nearest whole MWh, with fractions of 0.5 MWh or greater rounded up.  If a REC generator is decertified during the quarter, RECs will be issued on MWhs produced during the quarter until the date and time of decertification.  \n14.6.1\tAdjustments to Renewable Energy Credit Award Calculations\n(1)\tAdjustments (reductions) to REC awards are made for renewable facilities that use more than 2% fossil fuel, and for REC aggregators that use estimation techniques to report generation.\n(a)\tCo-Fired Generator Adjustments:\n(i)\tFor REC generators using a renewable energy technology that requires the use of fossil fuel that is greater than 2%, and less than or equal to 25%, of the total annual fuel input on a British Thermal Unit (BTU) or equivalent basis, RECs can only be earned on the renewable portion of the production.  RECs are awarded based on an adjusted number of MWh generated during the quarter.\n(ii)\tThe renewable energy Resource shall calculate the electricity generated by the unit in MWh, based on the BTUs (or equivalent) produced by the fossil fuel and the efficiency of the renewable energy Resource, subtract the MWh generated with fossil fuel input from the total MWh of generation and report the renewable energy generated to the Program Administrator;\n(b)\tREC Aggregator Adjustments:\nThe REC aggregator may provide the Program Administrator with sufficient information for the Program Administrator to estimate with reasonable accuracy the output of each unit, based on known or observed information that correlates closely with the generation output.  REC aggregators using approved estimation techniques to report renewable energy production shall be awarded one REC for every 1.25 MWh generated.\n14.6.2\tAwarding of Compliance Premiums\n(1)\tA Compliance Premium is awarded by the Program Administrator in conjunction with a REC that is generated by a renewable energy Resource installed and certified after September 1, 2005 that is not powered by wind.  For the purpose of the Solar Renewable Portfolio Standard (SRPS) requirements, one Compliance Premium is equal to one REC.\n(2)\tOne Compliance Premium shall be awarded for each REC awarded for energy generated until December 31, 2024.\n[NPRR1250:  Delete Section 14.6.2 above on September 1, 2025.]\n14.7\tTransfer of Renewable Energy Credits or Compliance Premiums Between Parties\n(1)\tOn the receipt of a request from the owner of a Renewable Energy Credit (REC) or Compliance Premium and purchaser of the REC or Compliance Premium, ERCOT will transfer the REC or Compliance Premium from the owner\u2019s REC trading account to the REC trading account specified in the transfer request.

RECs or Compliance Premiums specified by a Designated Representative for retirement must be in the REC trading account from which they are being retired at the time the request is submitted.  ERCOT shall retire such RECs or Compliance Premiums by removing them from the party\u2019s REC trading account and retiring the unique serial number, thus rendering the REC or Compliance Premium unusable for any other purpose.  ERCOT shall maintain records to archive all RECs or Compliance Premiums that have been retired and to identify the basis on which RECs or Compliance Premiums were retired.  The reasons for retiring RECs include mandatory compliance, voluntary retirement, and expiration.  The reasons for retiring Compliance Premiums include mandatory compliance, voluntary retirement, and expiration.\n14.10.1\tMandatory Retirement\n(1)\tFor each Compliance Period, by the date set forth in subsection (i)(2) of P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.173, Renewable Energy Credit Program, each Retail Entity\u2019s Designated Representative shall notify ERCOT of the RECs or Compliance Premiums in its REC trading account to be used (retired) to satisfy its Final Solar Renewable Portfolio Standard (SRPS) Requirement (FSRR) for the Compliance Period being settled.  Each REC or Compliance Premium that is not used will remain in the holder\u2019s REC trading account until it is transferred to another party\u2019s account, expires, or is otherwise retired.\n(2)\tFailure to provide sufficient RECs or Compliance Premiums by the date set forth in subsection (i)(2) of P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.173 shall be considered a failure of that Retail Entity to meet its REC retirement obligations.  ERCOT shall notify the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) when any Retail Entity fails to meet its REC retirement obligations.\n[NPRR1250:  Delete Section 14.10.1 above on September 1, 2025.]\n14.10.2\tVoluntary Retirement\n(1)\tAt the request of a REC Account Holder, ERCOT shall retire RECs and Compliance Premiums for reasons other than for meeting the mandated SRPS requirements.  Voluntarily retired RECs and Compliance Premiums may not be used to satisfy a Retail Entity\u2019s SRPS requirement.  ERCOT shall include information concerning RECs and Compliance Premiums retired voluntarily in its annual report to the PUCT.\n[NPRR1250:  Replace Section 14.10.2 above with the following on September 1, 2025:]\n14.10.1\tVoluntary Retirement\n(1)\tAt the request of a REC Account Holder, ERCOT shall retire RECs and Compliance Premiums.

Definitions of all TX SET codes referenced in this Section can be found in Section 19, Texas Standard Electronic Transaction.  A reference to any TX SET transaction should be read as referring to the named transaction or its Market Information System (MIS) equivalent, if any.  Transaction flow diagrams for Customer registration processing are posted on the ERCOT website.\n(5)\tERCOT will reject any initiating transaction due to date reasonableness if the requested implementation date is of more than 90 days in the future or 270 days in the past.  Initiating transactions are:  814_01, Switch Request; 814_16, Move In Request; and 814_24, Move Out Request.  ERCOT will reject an 814_18, Establish/Change/Delete CSA Request, transaction with a requested start date of more than 90 days in the future or a requested start date in the past.\n(6)\tERCOT will prioritize initiating or inbound transactions in the following manner.  The following timing requirement calculations will not include the duration of a planned and TAC subcommittee-approved ERCOT retail system outage:\n(a)\tLevel 1 \u2013 Same day 814_16 transactions, same day 814_24 transactions, 814_01 transactions and 814_20, ESI ID Maintenance Requests (Create), will be processed in one Retail Business Hour.\n(b)\tLevel 2 \u2013 Standard 814_16 transactions and standard 814_24 transactions will be processed in two Retail Business Hours.\n(c)\tLevel 3 \u2013 867_02, Historical Usage, 814_20, ESI ID Maintenance Requests (Maintain and Retire), will be processed in four Retail Business Hours.\n(d)\tLevel 4 \u2013 All 814_26, Historical Usage Requests, 814_18, Establish/Change/Delete CSA Requests, and 814_19, Establish/Change/Delete CSA Responses, will be processed in one Retail Business Day.\n(7)\tFor transactions to flow through ERCOT, back-dated transactions for a market-approved corrective action must meet the date reasonableness test.  Market Participants must work with ERCOT for any manual changes to transactions that fall outside these dates for market-approved corrective action.  However, a TDSP will reject a back-dated transaction that is not part of a market-approved transaction.\n(8)\tFor more information concerning the requirements for transaction processing in the retail market, please refer to the Retail Market Guide. \n15.1\tCustomer Switch of Competitive Retailer\n(1)\tThe following process shall be followed for a Competitive Retailer (CR) to switch an Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID).\n15.1.1\tSubmission of a Switch Request\n(1)\tThe CR shall submit a Switch Request to ERCOT using the 814_01, Switch Request.  The Switch Request shall include, at a minimum, the five-digit zip code and an ESI ID.  Within this transaction, the CR will also send information necessary for ERCOT to send a switch confirmation notice to the Customer as required by the applicable Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) rules.  The First Available Switch Date (FASD) is the day received by ERCOT unless received on a Sunday or an ERCOT holiday.  If received on a Sunday or an ERCOT holiday, the FASD will be calculated as the next day that is not a Sunday or an ERCOT holiday.\n15.1.1.1\tNotification to Customer of Switch Request\n(1)\tERCOT will send a switch confirmation notice to the Customer as specified in the PUCT rules.  This notice will give the Customer information regarding the Switch Request as described in the PUCT rules.\n15.1.1.2\tProvision of Historical Usage\n(1)\tA request for historical usage may be submitted along with a Switch Request or as an ad hoc request.\n15.1.1.2.1\tProvision of Historical Usage with a Switch Request\n(1)\tIf requested by the switching CR in the Switch Request, the Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) shall provide the most recent 12 months of historical usage, if available, to ERCOT, including monthly metered usage for the Customer\u2019s ESI ID and any applicable metered interval usage in accordance with the 867_02, Historical Usage.  ERCOT\u2019s business process for Switch Requests is not linked to the receipt of the historical usage and the processing of the switch will continue regardless of the TDSP returning historical usage.  Upon receipt of the historical usage from the TDSP, ERCOT shall forward the 867_02 transaction to the CR Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number provided by the TDSP within four Retail Business Hours.\n(2)\tProvision of meter read and historical usage data pursuant to this paragraph shall not be required when it would be prohibited by PUCT rules.\n15.1.1.2.2\tAd Hoc Requests for Historical Usage\n(1)\tTo request historical usage on an ad hoc basis, the CR of Record must submit an 814_26, Historical Usage Request, to ERCOT.  Within one Retail Business Day of receipt of an 814_26 transaction from a CR, ERCOT shall notify the TDSP of the ad-hoc request using the 814_26 transaction.  The TDSP shall provide the requested information to ERCOT within two Retail Business Days of receipt of the 814_26 transaction using the 814_27, Historical Usage Response.  ERCOT shall forward the usage information to the CR of Record using the 814_27 transaction within one Retail Business Day of receipt of the 814_27 transaction from the TDSP.  The TDSP shall provide the most recent 12 months of historical usage, if available, to ERCOT, including monthly, metered usage for the Customer\u2019s ESI ID information and any applicable metered interval usage in accordance with the 867_02, Historical Usage.  ERCOT will send the 867_02 transaction to the CR DUNS Number provided in the 867_02 transaction by the TDSP within four Retail Business Hours of receipt from the TDSP.\n(2)\tProvision of meter read and historical usage data pursuant to this paragraph shall not be required when prohibited by PUCT rules.\n15.1.1.3\tSwitch Enrollment Notification Request to TDSP\n(1)\tERCOT will submit to the TDSP serving the ESI ID, an enrollment notification request using the 814_03, Enrollment Notification Request, within one Retail Business Hour of the receipt of a valid Switch Request.  The notification will include the name of the CR requesting service to the ESI ID and will indicate the FASD calculated pursuant to Section 15.1.1, Submission of a Switch Request.\n15.1.1.4\tResponse from TDSP to Registration Notification Request\n(1)\tUpon receipt of an enrollment notification request, the TDSP shall provide ESI ID information to ERCOT, including:\n(a)\tESI ID;\n(b)\tService Address;\n(c)\tRate class and sub-class, if applicable;\n(d)\tSpecial needs indicator;\n(e)\tLoad Profile Type;\n(f)\tScheduled meter read date;\n(g)\tMeter type, identification number, number of dials and role for each meter at the ESI ID if the ESI ID is metered;\n(h)\tNumber and description of each unmetered device for unmetered ESI IDs;\n(i)\tStation ID; and\n(j)\tDistribution Loss Factor (DLF) code.\n(2)\tThis information shall be transmitted using the 814_04, Enrollment Notification Response, within two Retail Business Days of the receipt of the 814_03, Enrollment Notification Request.  If the TDSP does not respond with the ESI ID information within two Retail Business Days after the receipt of the 814_03 transaction from ERCOT, ERCOT shall create an internal tracking exception.  The switch will be held in \u201cin review\u201d status until the TDSP\u2019s 814_04 transaction response is received.  If the TDSP\u2019s 814_04 transaction is not received within three Retail Business Days of receipt of the 814_03 transaction from ERCOT and is still not received by the earlier of the requested date on the switch or within 20 Retail Business Days after the original submission of the 814_03 transaction from ERCOT, ERCOT shall change the status of the switch to \u201ccancel pending.\u201d  The TDSP will receive notification of the pending switch cancellation through the 814_08, Cancel Request.  The TDSP will respond using the 814_09, Cancel Response.  If the 814_09 transaction is an \u201caccept,\u201d the submitting CR will receive notification of the switch cancellation through the 814_08 transaction.  Any other CR involved in the request to which an 814_06, Loss Notification, has been sent will also receive notification of the switch cancellation through the 814_08 transaction.  If the 814_09 transaction from the TDSP is a reject, the switch will return to an \u201cin review\u201d status and the TDSP shall also transmit an 814_04 transaction within one Retail Business Day.  \n(3)\tIf the TDSP responds to ERCOT\u2019s 814_03 transaction with an 814_04 transaction and then later submits an 814_28, Complete Unexecutable or Permit Required, indicating the TDSP is unable to complete the switch, ERCOT will send the TDSP\u2019s 814_28 transaction to the requesting CR.  The TDSP will note the complete unexecutable reason on the 814_28 transaction.  The initiating transaction is considered unexecutable.  The current CR will remain the CR of Record.\n15.1.1.5\tResponse to Valid Enrollment Request\n(1)\tWithin one Retail Business Day of receipt of the TDSP\u2019s 814_04, Enrollment Notification Response, ERCOT will respond to the requesting CR in accordance with the 814_05, CR Enrollment Notification Response.  This response will contain the scheduled meter read date for the switch and all information the TDSP furnished to ERCOT under the TDSP\u2019s 814_04 transaction.  The TDSP must effectuate the switch within two Retail Business Days of the scheduled meter read date.\n15.1.1.6\tLoss Notification to Current Competitive Retailer (with date)\n(1)\tWithin two Retail Business Days of the scheduled meter read date for the switch, but not before the receipt of the TDSP\u2019s 814_04, Enrollment Notification Response, ERCOT will notify the current CR using the 814_06, Loss Notification.  This notification will contain the scheduled meter read date for the switch.\n15.1.1.7\tCompletion of Switch Request and Effective Switch Date\n(1)\tA Switch Request is effectuated on the actual meter read date in the 867_04, Initial Meter Read, or the final 867_03, Monthly or Final Usage, which must be equal to the scheduled meter read date.  The process for a specific Switch Request is complete upon receipt of the effectuating meter read sent by the TDSP.  The TDSP shall send the meter read information to ERCOT using the 867_03 transaction and 867_04 transaction within three Retail Business Days of the meter read.  This transaction will contain an effectuating meter read indicator.  If the TDSP has made every reasonable effort to get the actual data for the meter read and absolutely cannot, the TDSP may estimate the reading for the ESI ID, regardless of the meter type or Customer class.  When an estimate occurs on a demand meter, the demand indicator has not been reset.  Upon receipt, ERCOT will send final meter read information to the current CR DUNS Number provided in the 867_03 transaction by the TDSP and initial meter read information to the new CR DUNS Number provided in the 867_04 transaction by the TDSP using the 867_03 transaction and 867_04 transaction, as appropriate.  Meter reads will be sent to the CR DUNS Number within the Texas Standard Electronic Transaction (TX SET) transaction from the TDSP within 12 hours of receipt by ERCOT.\n(2)\tFailure by ERCOT to provide the initial meter read information does not change the Mass Transition Effective Date of the switch.\n(3)\tSwitches shall become effective at 0000 (midnight) on the actual date of the effectuating meter read.  The new CR may request a special meter read (including a profile-estimated meter read or interval meter calculation as allowed), in accordance with the TDSP\u2019s tariff.  For a special meter read, the switch is effective at 0000 (midnight) the day of the special meter read.  During the switch process, the Customer will continue to be served by its current CR.\n15.1.1.8\tRejection of Switch Request\n(1)\tERCOT will process Switch Requests upon receipt during Business Hours.  If the request is invalid, i.e., meets one of the requirements as identified in this Section, ERCOT will respond to the CR with the 814_02, Switch Reject Response, within one Retail Business Hour of ERCOT\u2019s receipt of the Switch Request, and the switch process will terminate.\n(2)\tERCOT will reject a Switch Request using the 814_02 transaction for any of the following reasons:\n(a)\tThe ESI ID provided is inactive or does not exist;\n(b)\tThe ESI ID and five digit zip code do not match;\n(c)\tThe CR is not certified by the PUCT, if required;\n(d)\tThe CR is not authorized to provide service in the TDSP service area;\n(e)\tThe CR has not registered as a CR with ERCOT in accordance with Section 16, Registration and Qualification of Market Participants;\n(f)\tThe PUCT directs ERCOT to reject registration requests from the CR per applicable PUCT rules;\n(g)\tThe standard Switch Request was received after a valid standard Switch Request was scheduled for the same date;\n(h)\tThe CR specifies a billing type or bill calculation code for an ESI ID that is not supported by the TDSP, Municipally Owned Utility (MOU), or Electric Cooperative (EC);\n(i)\tThe CR submits a Switch Request type that is invalid or undefined;\n(j)\tThe CR is already the CR of Record for the ESI ID or scheduled to be the CR of Record for the ESI ID on the requested date;\n(k)\tThe Customer notification name or address is required but invalid according to Texas Standard Electronic Transaction (TX SET) standards or is missing;\n(l)\tThe CR Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number is missing or invalid;\n(m)\tIf requesting a self-selected switch date, the CR requests a switch date that is before the FASD;\n(n)\tThe date on the self-selected switch already has a move in, move out, or switch scheduled; or\n(o)\tThe ESI ID is de-energized or scheduled to be de-energized on the date requested in the switch.  For standard requests, the FASD is used for the evaluation.\n15.1.2\tResponse from ERCOT to Drop to Affiliate Retail Electric Provider Request\n(1)\tERCOT will send a reject response using the 814_11, Drop Response, within one Retail Business Day to the current CR notifying the CR that the request is invalid.  \n15.1.3\tTransition Process\n(1)\tCertain circumstances may arise during the course of business in the Texas retail electric market that may necessitate the transition of ESI IDs from one CR to a Provider of Last Resort (POLR) or designated CR, or from one TDSP to another TDSP in quantities and on a time frame that is not completely supported by standard market transactions or business processes. \n15.1.3.1\tMass Transition Process \n(1)\tIn a Mass Transition event, ERCOT shall submit the 814_03, Enrollment Notification Request, requesting a meter read for the associated ESI IDs, for a date two days after the date ERCOT initiates such transactions to the TDSP.  The 814_03 transaction shall contain a request for historical usage and the requested date for the meter read date to transfer the ESI IDs.  If an actual meter read cannot be obtained by the date requested in the 814_03 transaction, then the meter read may be estimated by the TDSP.  (See Retail Market Guide Section 9, Appendices, Appendix F2, Timeline for Initiation of a Mass Transition on a Business Day not Prior to a Weekend or ERCOT Holiday.)   \n(2)\tThe TDSP shall respond to the 814_03 transaction within two Retail Business Days with an 814_04, Enrollment Notification Response, and an 867_02, Historical Usage.  Within one Retail Business Day of receiving the 814_04 transaction, ERCOT will send an 814_11, Drop Response, to the transitioning CR and forward an 814_14, Drop Enrollment Request, with the scheduled meter read date, to the POLR(s) or designated CR.  The TDSP shall submit an 867_04, Initial Meter Read, with a meter read date equal to the scheduled meter read date in the 814_04 transaction, which will also be known as the transition date.  (See Retail Market Guide Section 9, Appendix D1, Transaction Timing Matrix, for specific transaction timings.) \n(3)\tERCOT shall identify and monitor transitioned ESI IDs for a period of 60 days from the Mass Transition Date, as defined in the Retail Market Guide.  Identification of the transitioned ESI ID shall terminate either upon the first completed switch, move in, move out, or at the end of the 60 day period, whichever occurs first.\n(4)\tFor a detailed outline of the business process and responsibilities of all Entities involved in a Mass Transition event, refer to the Retail Market Guide Section 7, Market Processes.  \n15.1.3.2\tAcquisition Transfer Process \n(1)\tIn an Acquisition Transfer event, ERCOT shall submit the 814_03, Enrollment Notification Request, requesting a meter read for the associated ESI IDs.  The 814_03 transaction shall contain a request for historical usage and the requested date or FASD for the meter read date to transfer the ESI IDs.  If an actual meter read cannot be obtained by the date requested in the 814_03 transaction, then the meter read may be estimated by the TDSP.\n(2)\tThe TDSP shall respond to the 814_03 transaction within two Retail Business Days with an 814_04, Enrollment Notification Response, and an 867_02, Historical Usage.  Within one Retail Business Day of receiving the 814_04 transaction, ERCOT will send an 814_11, Drop Response, to the transitioning CR and forward an 814_14, Drop Enrollment Request, with the scheduled meter read date, to the designated CR.  The TDSP shall submit an 867_04, Initial Meter Read, with a meter read date equal to the scheduled meter read date in the 814_04 transaction, which will also be known as the transition date.  See Retail Market Guide Section 9, Appendices, Appendix D1, Transaction Timing Matrix, for specific transaction timings.\n(3)\tFor a detailed outline of the business process and responsibilities of all Entities involved in an Acquisition Transfer event, refer to the Retail Market Guide Section 7, Market Processes.\n15.1.3.3\tCustomer Billing Contact Information \n(1)\tAll CRs participating in the Texas retail electric market shall provide, in accordance with the Retail Market Guide, current Customer billing contact information to ERCOT for use in the event of a Mass Transition.  ERCOT shall retain the Customer data from the most recent submission, to be used in lieu of data from the exiting CR, in instances where the exiting CR does not provide data.  When a Mass Transition occurs, ERCOT shall provide the Gaining CRs with available Customer billing contact information for the ESI IDs the Gaining CRs will be obtaining through the Mass Transition event.  During a Mass Transition event, ERCOT shall also provide the TDSPs with available Customer contact information.\n(2)\tFor a detailed outline of the process, refer to the Retail Market Guide Section 7, Market Processes.\n15.1.4\tBeginning Service (New Construction Completed and Move Ins)\n(1)\tThis Section applies to Customers moving into a Premise that is not currently being served by a CR (may or may not still be energized) or when construction has been completed by the TDSP for a new Premise and the Premise has been assigned an ESI ID and is ready to receive electric service.\n(2)\tThis Section does not apply to instances where construction services are required.  Those procedures are covered in the TDSP tariff.\n15.1.4.1\tMove-In Request to Begin Electric Service\n(1)\tThe process described below relates to the transactions required to process a move in.  A manual work-around process for same day and safety net move ins is also used by Market Participants in the Texas retail electric market to ensure that a Customer receives electric service in a timely manner.  The manual work-around process is documented in the Retail Market Guide.  \n(2)\tIn accordance with PUCT rules, the Customer shall contact a CR to begin electric service at an ESI ID.  The CR shall submit to ERCOT a Move-In Request in accordance with 814_16, Move In Request.  Move ins will be considered same day, if the date requested is the same day the 814_16 transaction is processed at ERCOT.  Same day move ins will be forwarded to the TDSP within one Retail Business Hour of receipt by ERCOT.  Standard move ins, those move ins not requesting same day services, will be forwarded to the TDSP within one Retail Business Hour of receipt by ERCOT.\n(3)\tTwo Retail Business Days prior to the scheduled meter read date of the move in or upon receipt of the TDSP 814_04, Enrollment Notification Response, whichever is later, ERCOT will determine if the ESI ID is currently served or is scheduled to be served by another CR.  If a move out from the current CR is scheduled for the same day as the move in, the TDSP will either complete both the move out and move in or will unexecute the move out, only working the move in.  If, within four Retail Business Days of the scheduled date, the move out is still in a scheduled state, ERCOT shall cancel the move out and send cancellation notices to the TDSP and the respective CRs.  ERCOT will submit an 814_06, Loss Notification, to the current CR with a code indicating a forced move out.\n(4)\tIf requested by the CR in the Move-In Request and permitted under the PUCT rules, the TDSP shall provide up to 12 months of the most recent historical usage, as available, including monthly-metered usage and any applicable metered interval usage using the 867_02, Historical Usage.  ERCOT\u2019s business process for a Move-In Request is not linked to the receipt of the historical usage and the processing of the move in will continue regardless of the TDSP returning historical usage.  This information shall be provided to the CR DUNS Number provided in the 867_02 transaction by the TDSP within four Retail Business Hours after ERCOT receipt of the 867_02 transaction from the TDSP.  The TDSP shall respond within two Retail Business Days after receipt of the 814_03, Enrollment Notification Request.  If historical usage is not available, the TDSP will indicate this in the 814_04, Enrollment Notification Response.\n15.1.4.2\tResponse to Invalid Move-In Request\n(1)\tIf the Move-In Request is invalid, ERCOT will respond to the CR using the 814_17, Move In Reject Response, within one Retail Business Hour of receiving the 814_16, Move In Request, with the exception of a move in that is invalid because of \u201cInvalid ESI ID.\u201d  In the case of \u201cInvalid ESI ID,\u201d ERCOT will hold the Move-In Request and continue to retry the request at regular intervals for 48 hours counting only hours on Retail Business Days, but not only Business Hours.  If the request is invalid in accordance with Section 15.1.4.8, Rejection of Move-In Request, the move in process will then terminate.  If the request is valid, the process continues as described in Section 15.1.4.5, Response to Valid Move-In Request.\n15.1.4.3\tNotification to Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider of Move In\n(1)\tERCOT will process Move-In Requests upon receipt during Business Hours.  ERCOT will submit to the TDSP serving the ESI ID an 814_03, Enrollment Notification Request, within one Retail Business Hour of receiving a valid Move-In Request.  The notification will include the name of the new CR providing service to the ESI ID and will include the requested move in date by the CR.\n(2)\tIf the TDSP receives the 814_03 transaction before 1700, a same day move in will be completed that day.\n15.1.4.4\tResponse to Enrollment Notification Request from Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (Move In)\n(1)\tUpon receipt of an enrollment notification request, the TDSP shall provide ESI ID information within the 814_04, Enrollment Notification Response, including:\n(a)\tESI ID;\n(b)\tService Address;\n(c)\tRate class (if established*) and sub-class (if established*), if applicable;\n(d)\tSpecial needs indicator;\n(e)\tLoad Profile Type;\n(f)\tScheduled meter read date;\n(g)\tMeter type and role for each meter at the ESI ID, if ESI ID is metered;\n(h)\tIdentification number and number of dials for each meter at the ESI ID, if ESI ID is metered (if meter is present);\n(i)\tFor unmetered EDS IDs, number and description of each unmetered device (if devices are present*);\n(j)\tStation ID;\n(k)\tDLF code;\n(l)\tPremise type; and\n(m)\tMeter reading cycle or meter cycle by day of the month.\n*\tIf not sent on the 814_04 transaction, the TDSP must send the rate class and sub-class on the 814_20, ESI ID Maintenance Request, when established, to complete the move in.  The TDSP must send the 814_20 transaction prior to sending the monthly usage in the 867_03, Monthly or Final Usage.  ERCOT will neither hold transactions nor validate the order of receipt of these transactions prior to sending to the CRs.\n(2)\tIf the TDSP does not respond with either the 814_04 transaction or the 814_28, Complete Unexecutable or Permit Required, within two Retail Business Days after receiving the 814_03, Enrollment Notification Request, ERCOT shall create an internal tracking exception.  The move in will be held \u201cin review\u201d until the TDSP\u2019s 814_04 transaction or 814_28 transaction is received.  If the TDSP\u2019s 814_04 transaction or 814_28 transaction, Permit Required, is not received within three Retail Business Days of receipt of the 814_03 transaction from ERCOT and is still not received by the earlier of the requested date on the move in or within 20 Retail Business Days after the original submission of the 814_03 transaction from ERCOT, ERCOT shall change the status of the move in to \u201ccancel pending\u201d status.  The TDSP will receive notification of the pending cancellation through the 814_08, Cancel Request.  The TDSP will respond using the 814_09, Cancel Response, within one Retail Business Day of receiving ERCOT\u2019s 814_08 transaction.  If the 814_09 transaction is accepted, relevant CRs will receive notification of the cancellation through the 814_08 transaction.  If the 814_09 transaction from the TDSP is a reject, the move in will return to an \u201cin review\u201d status and the TDSP shall also transmit an 814_04 transaction or 814_28 transaction, Permit Required, within one Retail Business Day.\n(3)\tIf the meter is present at the Premise at the time the TDSP receives the 814_03 transaction from ERCOT, and the TDSP responds with the 814_04 transaction, the information as identified in paragraph (1) above shall be transmitted from the TDSP to ERCOT using the 814_04 transaction.  ERCOT shall forward ESI ID/Premise information using the 814_05, CR Enrollment Notification Response, to the requesting CR.\n(4)\tIf a meter has not been established at the ESI ID/Premise at the time when the TDSP receives the 814_03 transaction from ERCOT for a move in, the TDSP may respond with the 814_04 transaction without meter information, TDSP rate class and sub-class, and the number and description of un-metered devices to ERCOT.  ERCOT shall forward the ESI ID/Premise information using the 814_05 transaction to the requesting CR.  If the TDSP submits the 814_04 transaction with the information as identified in this paragraph, the TDSP will submit this missing information to ERCOT using the 814_20 transaction when established to complete the process.  ERCOT shall forward the ESI ID/Premise information received from the TDSP\u2019s 814_20 transaction to the requesting CR within four Retail Business Hours of receipt from the TDSP.  \n(5)\tIf the TDSP responds to ERCOT\u2019s 814_03 transaction for a move in with an 814_28 transaction, Permit Required, ERCOT shall send this transaction within two Retail Business Hours to the requesting CR to notify that a permit is required.  Upon receipt of the TDSP\u2019s 814_28 transaction, ERCOT will reset the 20 Retail Business Day clock, starting the clock on the requested date for the move in, and will separately track the non-response for the 814_04 transaction due to permit required.  The move in remains in a \u201cpermit pending\u201d status.\n(6)\tAfter expiration of the 20 Retail Business Days, non-response for the 814_04 transaction because the TDSP has not received the permit, ERCOT will initiate the 814_08 transaction to the TDSP the first Retail Business Day after expiration of the 20 Retail Business Day clock, and will set the status to \u201ccancel pending.\u201d  The TDSP will respond to ERCOT using the 814_09 transaction.  If the TDSP receives the appropriate permit prior to the receipt of the 814_08 transaction from ERCOT, the TDSP will submit the 814_04 transaction with the scheduled move in date and the 814_09 transaction with a status of reject and the move in process will proceed.  If the TDSP responds with the 814_09 transaction with a status of accept, ERCOT will cancel the move in, note the cancel reason as \u201cpermit not received,\u201d and send the cancellation notice to the appropriate CRs.\n(7)\tIf the TDSP responds to ERCOT\u2019s 814_03 transaction with the 814_04 transaction, and then later submits the 814_28 transaction, ERCOT will send the TDSP\u2019s 814_28 transaction to the requesting CR.  The TDSP will note the complete unexecutable reason on the 814_28 transaction.  The initiating transaction is considered cancelled in ERCOT, TDSP and CR systems and the current CR remains the CR of Record for that Premise or the Premise remains in a de-energized status.  \n(8)\tIf after submitting a 814_04 transaction on a forced move out, the TDSP is unable to obtain an actual meter read despite reasonable efforts the TDSP may complete the move in using an estimated meter read or complete unexecutable if the meter requires a permit, unsafe conditions exist, tampering has been detected or other similar conditions are found that would not allow an actual reading to be obtained.\n15.1.4.5\tResponse to Valid Move-In Request\n(1)\tERCOT will respond to the CR using the 814_05, CR Enrollment Notification Response, within one Retail Business Hour of receiving the TDSP\u2019s 814_04, Enrollment Notification Response, on a same day or standard Move-In Request.  This response will contain the scheduled meter read date for the move in and all other information contained in the TDSP\u2019s 814_04 transaction.\n15.1.4.5.1\tMaintain Electric Service Identifier with Meter Level Information Request/Response\n(1)\tIf the TDSP returns the 814_04, Enrollment Notification Response, without complete information (meter information and/or unmetered device(s) information), the TDSP is required to provide this information to ERCOT in the 814_20, ESI ID Maintenance Request, following the installation of the meter or unmetered devices.  The TDSP must send the 814_20 transaction at the same time or prior to sending the 867_04, Initial Meter Read, to ERCOT.  ERCOT will forward the meter information in the 814_20 transaction and the 867_04 transaction to the CR.\n15.1.4.6\tNotification to Current Competitive Retailer\n(1)\tAn evaluation is done on the current CR two Retail Business Days prior to the scheduled meter read date, but not before receipt of the TDSP\u2019s 814_04, Enrollment Notification Response.  ERCOT will submit to the current CR a notification using the 814_06, Loss Notification, two days before the scheduled meter read date as set forth in the 814_04 transaction.  \n(2)\tIf ERCOT has submitted a notification using the 814_06 transaction to the current CR before the TDSP sends the 814_28, Complete Unexecutable or Permit Required, to ERCOT, ERCOT will notify the current CR by forwarding the 814_28 transaction to the CR.  The current CR will remain the CR of Record.\n15.1.4.6.1\tComplete Unexecutable \n(1)\tAfter the new CR has received the Premise information in the 814_05, CR Enrollment Notification Response, the TDSP will wait until the scheduled move in date to energize the Premise.  If upon the field visit to the Premise, the TDSP is unable to execute due to conditions that require Customer resolution and if power is not flowing to the Premise, the TDSP will send a notification request to ERCOT using the 814_28, Complete Unexecutable or Permit Required.  The transaction will indicate the appropriate reason code for the complete unexecutable of the Move-In Request.  If the move in has been complete unexecutable, ERCOT will internally flag the transaction as complete and will not expect the 867_04, Initial Meter Read, to complete the life cycle.  ERCOT will respond to the TDSP using the 814_29, Complete Unexecutable or Permit Required Response.\n(2)\tIf ERCOT receives the 814_28, Complete Unexecutable or Permit Required, ERCOT will forward the notification to the CR.  In this case the CR will not receive the 867_04 transaction.  Once the condition has been corrected by the Customer, a new set of transactions must be initiated by the CR starting with the 814_16, Move In Request.\n15.1.4.7\tCompletion of Move-In Request and Effective Move In Date\n(1)\tIf upon the field visit to the Premise, the TDSP is unable to obtain a meter read due to conditions that require Customer resolution but power is flowing to the Premise, the TDSP may complete the move in using an estimated meter read or complete unexecutable if the meter requires a permit, unsafe conditions exist, tampering has been detected, or other similar conditions are found that would not allow an actual reading to be taken.\n15.1.4.7.1\tStandard Move-In Requests\n(1)\tA standard Move-In Request is effectuated on the period start date in the 867_04, Initial Meter Read, which shall be the date requested in the 814_16, Move In Request, provided that the 814_03, Enrollment Notification Request, was received by the TDSP by 1700 at least two Retail Business Days prior to the requested date.  If the 814_03 transaction is not received by the TDSP by 1700 at least two Retail Business Days prior to the requested date, the move in will be completed within two Retail Business Days after the receipt of the 814_03 transaction by the TDSP.  An extension of this period may be necessitated by circumstance requiring Customer resolution or construction of new facilities by the TDSP to serve the Premise.\n(2)\tA Move-In Request is completed upon receipt of the effectuating meter read sent by the TDSP.  Upon receipt, the TDSP will send initial meter read information to ERCOT and ERCOT shall resend to the CR DUNS Number provided in the 867_04 transaction by the TDSP within four Retail Business Hours using the 867_04 transaction.  The 867_04 transaction will be provided to ERCOT within three Retail Business Days of the meter read.\n(3)\tThe move in will become effective at 0000 (midnight) on the actual date of the effectuating meter read.  The new CR may request a special meter read (including a profile-estimated meter read or interval meter calculation as allowed), in accordance with the TDSP\u2019s tariff.  For a special meter read, the move in is effective at 0000 (midnight) the day of the special meter read.  Meter reads will be sent to the CR DUNS Number within the TX SET transaction from the TDSP within 12 hours of receipt by ERCOT.\n15.1.4.7.2\tSame Day Move-In Requests\n(1)\tA same day Move-In Request is effectuated on the period start date in the 867_04, Initial Meter Read, which shall be the date requested in the 814_16, Move In Request, provided that the request was received by the TDSP by 1700 on the date requested.  If the TDSP does not receive the same day move in by 1700, the move in will be completed no later than the next Retail Business Day.  An extension of this period may be necessitated by circumstance requiring Customer resolution or construction of new facilities by the TDSP to serve the Premise.\n(2)\tA Move-In Request is completed upon receipt of the effectuating meter read sent by the TDSP.  Upon receipt, the TDSP will send initial meter read information to ERCOT and ERCOT shall resend to the CR DUNS Number provided in the 867_04 transaction by the TDSP within four Retail Business Hours using the 867_04 transaction.  The 867_04 transaction will be provided to ERCOT within three Retail Business Days of the meter read.\n(3)\tThe move in will become effective at 0000 (midnight) on the actual date of the effectuating meter read.  The new CR may request a special meter read (including a profile-estimated meter read or interval meter calculation as allowed), in accordance with the TDSP\u2019s tariff.  For a special meter read, the move in is effective at 0000 (midnight) the day of the special meter read.  Meter reads will be sent to the CR DUNS Number within the TX SET transaction from the TDSP within 12 hours of receipt by ERCOT.\n15.1.4.8\tRejection of Move-In Request\n(1)\tERCOT will reject the 814_16, Move In Request, using the 814_17, Move In Reject Response, for any of the following reasons:\n(a)\tThe ESI ID provided is inactive or does not exist;\n(b)\tThe ESI ID and five-digit zip code do not match;\n(c)\tThe CR is not certified by the PUCT, if required;\n(d)\tThe CR is not authorized to provide service in the TDSP service area.\n(e)\tCR has not registered as a CR with ERCOT in accordance to Section 16, Registration and Qualification of Market Participants.\n(f)\tThe PUCT directs ERCOT to reject registration requests from the CR per applicable PUCT rules;\n(g)\tThe CR specifies a billing type or billing calculation code for an ESI ID that is not supported by the TDSP, MOU, or EC;\n(h)\tThe CR submits a request type that is invalid or undefined;\n(i)\tThe CR DUNS Number is missing or invalid; or\n(j)\tThere is already a Move-In Request in progress for the same requested date, \u201cnot first in\u201d for the same requested date.\n15.1.5\tService Termination (Move Out)\n15.1.5.1\tRequest to Terminate Service\n(1)\tWhen a CR receives notice that a Customer is moving out, the CR may terminate service to that ESI ID by submitting a Move-Out Request to ERCOT using the 814_24, Move Out Request.  Move outs will be considered same day, if the date requested is the same day the 814_24 transaction is processed at ERCOT.  Same day move outs will be forwarded to the TDSP within one Retail Business Hour of receipt by ERCOT.  Move outs not requesting same day services, will be forwarded to the TDSP within two Retail Business Hours of receipt by ERCOT.    \n(2)\tERCOT will determine if the ESI ID associated with the Premise has a Continuous Service Agreement (CSA) CR.  \n(a)\tIf there is an active CSA with an end date after the move out date on record or a CSA with a start date prior to or equal to the requested date of the move out, ERCOT will notify the TDSP by sending the 814_03, Enrollment Notification Request, with the move out indicator, within one Retail Business Hour for same day requests and two Retail Business Hours for move outs not requesting same day services.  ERCOT will notify the CSA CR of the move out using the 814_22, CSA CR Move In Request, within two Retail Business Days of the scheduled meter read date, but not before the receipt of the TDSP\u2019s 814_04, Enrollment Notification Response.  \n(b)\tIf there is not an active CSA CR or a CSA with a start date prior to or equal to the requested date of the move out, ERCOT will notify the TDSP to de-energize the ESI ID by sending the 814_24 transaction and will remove the requester as the CR of Record for that ESI ID.\n(3)\tWhen requesting to terminate service where a CSA exists, the CSA CR may terminate service to that ESI ID by submitting an 814_24 transaction with the \u201cMove Out CSA De-Energize\u201d code to ERCOT.  ERCOT will validate that the submitting CR is the current CSA CR of Record (or pending CSA CR for the move out date submitted).  If the submitting CR is not the current CSA CR of Record, ERCOT will reject the 814_24 transaction by sending the 814_25, Move Out Response.  Move outs will be considered same day if the date requested is the same day the 814_24 transaction is processed at ERCOT.  Same day move outs will be forwarded to the TDSP within one Retail Business Hour of receipt by ERCOT.  Move outs not requesting same day services will be forwarded to the TDSP within two Retail Business Hours of receipt by ERCOT.\n15.1.5.2\tResponse to Invalid Move-Out Request\n(1)\tIf the Move-Out Request is invalid, ERCOT will respond to the CR using the 814_25, Move Out Response, within one Retail Business Hour of receiving the 814_24, Move Out Request, with the exception of a move out that is invalid because of \u201cde-energized ESI ID.\u201d  In the case of \u201cde-energized ESI ID,\u201d ERCOT will hold the Move-Out Request and continue to retry the request at regular intervals for 48 hours counting only hours on Retail Business Days but not only Business Hours.  If the request is invalid, the move out process will then terminate.

The TDSP will note the complete unexecutable reason on the 814_28 transaction.  The initiating transaction is considered unexecutable.  The current CR will remain the CR of Record.\n(6)\tIf, despite reasonable efforts, the TDSP is unable to complete the move out after submitting the 814_25 transaction, it shall unexecute the move out using the 814_28 transaction, Complete Unexecutable, and the TDSP shall note the complete unexecutable reason on the 814_28 transaction.  ERCOT shall forward the 814_28 transaction to the CR within two Retail Business Hours of receipt from the TDSP.  \n(7)\tUpon receipt of the 814_28 transaction, the CR will make reasonable attempts to contact the Customer to address access issues if the reason the transaction was unexecuted relates to meter access.  Otherwise, the CR will contact the TDSP in an attempt to address the problems that precluded execution of the transaction.  TDSPs shall provide CRs with a list of contacts for this purpose, including escalation contacts which shall be used by a CR only in the event that the initial contacts fail to respond to the CR within a reasonable time.\n(8)\tAfter the CR has made reasonable efforts to either contact the Customer or address issues with the TDSP, the CR may submit a second 814_24 transaction to initiate the move out process.  The CR will submit the second Move-Out Request within 30 days of the receipt of the 814_28 transaction.  If the TDSP continues to encounter difficulty in completing the transaction, the TDSP shall complete the transaction using an estimated meter read and make every reasonable effort to interrupt service at the premise to prevent additional cost to the market, such as Unaccounted for Energy (UFE) and repeated field trips executed by the TDSP to disconnect service or in management of the market-approved manual process for managing the left in hot process.

If ERCOT determines that there is a CSA CR or there is scheduled to be a CSA CR on the scheduled meter read date, ERCOT will submit to the CSA CR a notification using the 814_06, Loss Notification.  \n(2)\tIf ERCOT has submitted a notification using the 814_06 transaction to the CSA CR and then the TDSP sends the 814_28, Complete Unexecutable or Permit Required, to ERCOT, ERCOT will notify the CSA CR by forwarding the 814_28 transaction.  The CSA CR will remain the CR of Record.\n15.2\tDatabase Queries\n (1)\tMarket Participants may obtain information from ERCOT to determine or to verify the Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID) for a Service Delivery Point.  The following information can be obtained through a database query, an extract, or an Application Programming Interface (API) on the ERCOT website:\n(a)\tService Address;\n(b)\tMeter read code;\n(c)\tESI ID;\n(d)\tTransmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP);\n(e)\tPremise type;\n(f)\tCurrent status (active/de-energized/inactive) with effective date;\n(g)\tMove in/move out pending flag with associated date, if applicable;\n(h)\tPower region;\n(i)\tStation ID; \n(j)\tMetered/unmetered flag;\n(k)\tESI ID dates that include:\n(i)\tEligibility date; \n(ii)\tStart date; \n(iii)\tCreate date; and \n(iv)\tRetire date;\n(l)\tProvider of Last Resort (POLR) Customer class as defined in subsection (c) of P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.43, Provider of Last Resort (POLR); \n(m)\tSettlement Advanced Metering System (AMS) meter or Municipally Owned Utility (MOU) / Electric Cooperative (EC) Non-BUSIDRRQ Interval Data Recorder (IDR) indicator that provides a true/false value as determined by ERCOT\u2019s system evaluation of the current Load Profile ID assignment of an ESI ID; \n(n)\tTDSP AMS indicator that is assigned by the TDSP to denote the following:\n(i)\tAMSR \u2013 an AMS meter or MOU/EC Non-BUSIDRRQ IDR with remote connect and disconnect capability; \n(ii)\tAMSM \u2013 an AMS meter or MOU/EC Non-BUSIDRRQ IDR without remote connect and disconnect capability; or \n(iii)\tNull \u2013 neither an AMS meter type nor an MOU/EC Non-BUSIDRRQ IDR exists at this Premise; and \n(o)\tSwitch hold indicator;\n(p)\tCounty; and\n(q)\tMetered service type.\n(2) \tAt least daily, ERCOT will provide all of the attributes listed above when an 814_20, ESI ID Maintenance Request, is received and accepted by ERCOT that creates an ESI ID, or makes changes to the switch hold or the provisioned AMS meter indicator of an ESI ID.\n15.2.1\tFind ESI ID Function on the Market Information System \n(1)\tMarket Participants with an ERCOT digital certificate can obtain information to verify the Service Address for a Service Delivery Point using the Find ESI ID function on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area.  The Find ESI ID function returns the information as identified in Section 15.2, Database Queries.\n15.2.2\tFind Transaction Function on the Market Information System \n(1)\tCompetitive Retailers (CRs) or TDSPs with an ERCOT digital certificate may obtain transaction information from ERCOT to review business processes (i.e. Switch Request, Move-In Request, etc.) on ESI IDs.  The Find Transaction function provides both summary and detailed transaction information for an ESI ID.  The data displayed is confidential information and therefore is restricted by digital certificate.  Access to the ESI ID information displayed is limited based on transaction receiver/sender, TDSP ownership, or the Retail Electric Provider (REP) of Record for each ESI ID.  MIS help screens provide detailed descriptions of the field contents and related screens.  \n15.2.3\tElectric Service Identifier Extract on the Market Information System \n(1)\tERCOT posts a downloadable extract to the ERCOT website which contains the same information as listed in Section 15.2, Database Queries.  The information provided allows Entities that do not have a digital certificate and are unable to access the information through the Find ESI ID function to use the information to determine or to verify the ESI ID for a Service Delivery Point using the Service Address.  This extract is also used by Entities to incorporate ESI ID information into their database systems.\n15.3\tMonthly Meter Reads\n(1)\tEach Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) shall send monthly consumption information for all non-ERCOT-Polled Settlement (EPS) Meter Electric Service Identifiers (ESI IDs) within its service area to ERCOT not later than three Retail Business Days after the scheduled meter read cycle or scheduled meter cycle by day of the month for a point of delivery, using the 867_03, Monthly or Final Usage.  TDSPs shall send monthly consumption information for all ESI IDs associated with EPS-metered facilities to ERCOT no later than three Retail Business Days after TDSP receipt of daily EPS Meter data from ERCOT according to the TDSP scheduled meter read cycle or scheduled meter cycle by day of the month for a point of delivery, using the 867_03 transaction.  ERCOT will forward ERCOT-accepted consumption information to the Competitive Retailer (CR) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number provided in the 867_03 transaction by the TDSP within 12 hours.\n(2)\tIf the meter read for an ESI ID fails the TDSP\u2019s internal validation procedures, the TDSP may, at its discretion, delay sending consumption information for the ESI ID to ERCOT for an additional seven days in order to obtain a valid meter reading.\n(3)\tIf a TDSP is unable to obtain a meter reading for an ESI ID because the TDSP is denied access to the meter, the TDSP may, at its discretion, delay sending consumption information for the ESI ID to ERCOT for an additional seven days in order to obtain a valid meter reading.\n(4)\tA TDSP, with notification to the market, may suspend the transmission of monthly consumption information during periods of storm restoration or other emergency operations undertaken pursuant to its emergency operations plan.\n(5)\tFor non-ERCOT ESI IDs, TDSPs shall have the option of sending monthly consumption information and effectuating meter reads to ERCOT using the 867_03 transaction.  ERCOT will then forward the monthly consumption and meter read information to the CR DUNS Number provided in the 867_03 transaction by the TDSP within one Retail Business Day.\n15.4\tElectric Service Identifier\n(1)\tEach Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) Service Delivery Point shall have a unique number within Texas.  Once this unique number has been created and assigned to a Service Delivery Point, it shall not be re-issued, even in the event of termination of the associated point-of-service.  This unique number shall be referred to as the Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID).\n(2)\tNotwithstanding the foregoing, in those situations where an ESI ID has been inadvertently placed into inactive status and upon notification from the responsible TDSP, ERCOT shall re-instate the ESI ID for that Service Delivery Point.\n15.4.1\tElectric Service Identifier Format \n(1)\tThe ESI ID will have the following format:\n10xxxxxyyy..yy\nWhere:\n10\tRepresents a placeholder for future use;\nxxxxx\tIs the five-digit Department of Energy identification code for the assigning TDSP; and\nyyy..yy\tIs up to 29 alphanumeric characters assigned by the TDSP.\n(2)\tAllowable alphanumeric characters are 0-9 and A-Z.  The total length of the ESI ID cannot exceed 36 alphanumeric characters.\n(3)\tIt is the TDSP\u2019s responsibility to create, assign, maintain and retire, as necessary, an ESI ID to each Service Delivery Point in its service area.\n15.4.1.1\tAssignment of ESI IDs to Unmetered Service Delivery Points\n(1)\tIn general, each unmetered Service Delivery Point will be assigned an ESI ID corresponding to the point of delivery from the TDSP system to the Customer or Load.  The TDSP may, however, aggregate unmetered Service Delivery Points into one ESI ID provided they meet all of the following conditions:\n(a)\tThe Service Delivery Points are owned by the same Customer and are located at the same physical location (an exception is allowed for governmental unmetered loads such as street lighting and traffic signals);\n(b)\tAll Service Delivery Points have the same Usage Profile;\n(c)\tAll Service Delivery Points have the same voltage and are located in the same Unaccounted for Energy (UFE) zone and same Load Zone; and\n(d)\tThe TDSP\u2019s tariffs allow aggregation of unmetered Service Delivery Points.\n15.4.1.2\tAssignment of ESI IDs to metered Service Delivery Points\n(1)\tIn general, each metered Service Delivery Point will be assigned an ESI ID corresponding to an existing billing meter.  However, the TDSP may aggregate metered Service Delivery Points into one ESI ID provided they meet all the following conditions:\n(a)\tThe Service Delivery Points are owned by the same Customer and are at the same Service Address;\n(b)\tAll Service Delivery Points have the same Load Profile or all Service Delivery Points have Interval Data Recorders (IDRs);\n(c)\tAll Service Delivery Points have the same voltage and are located in the same UFE zone and same Load Zone; and\n(d)\tThe TDSP\u2019s tariffs allow aggregation of separately metered Service Delivery Points.\n(2)\tA Customer may request that the TDSP assign separate ESI IDs for separate Service Delivery Points as allowed in the TDSP\u2019s tariffs.\n(3)\tA TDSP may not assign an ESI ID to submeters where the energy consumption for those meters is included in another ESI ID.  This does not prohibit the TDSP from tracking these submeters internally or charging for submetering services via the Competitive Retailer (CR).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, TDSPs using the practice of subtract metering shall assign an ESI ID to both the master meter and the subtract meter and report adjusted consumption accordingly.\n15.4.1.3\tSplitting a Service Delivery Point into Multiple ESI IDs\n(1)\tA Service Delivery Point with Load above one MW may split the actual meter into up to four virtual meters which would each have its own ESI ID.  This process of splitting the meter into separate ESI IDs shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of Section 10, Metering.  Reissuing and reassignment of ESI IDs is prohibited.\n15.4.1.4\tNew Electric Service Identifier Creation\n(1)\tSince it is anticipated that the ESI ID will be based on the existing TDSP account or Premise numbers (with a prefix identifying the TDSP), the TDSP will assign and submit to the registration database ESI IDs for new Premises as service is extended to them.  TDSPs that opt in after the market startup will be responsible for the creation of ESI IDs for all existing Service Delivery Points in their service territory.\n(2)\tThe TDSP will send ESI ID information using the 814_20, ESI ID Maintenance Request.  ERCOT will verify that this transaction meets Texas Standard Electronic Transaction (TX SET) specifications.  ERCOT will respond to the TDSP within one Retail Business Hour, with acceptance or rejection of these transactions using the 814_21, ESI ID Maintenance Response.  At least the following data elements are required to be sent in the 814_20 transaction:\n(a)\tESI ID;\n(b)\tService Address; city, state, zip, county;\n(c)\tLoad Profile Type;\n(d)\tMeter reading cycle or meter cycle by day of month;\n(e)\tStation ID;\n(f)\tDistribution Loss Factor (DLF) code; and\n(g)\tPremise type.\n(3)\tThe TDSP must receive an accepted 814_21 from ERCOT prior to initiating electric service pursuant to Section 15.1.4, Beginning Service (New Construction Completed and Move Ins).\n15.4.1.5\tElectric Service Identifier Maintenance\n(1)\tThe TDSP will notify ERCOT of any changes in information related to an ESI ID for which it is responsible.  The TDSP will send changes to ERCOT using the 814_20, ESI ID Maintenance Request.  ERCOT will respond to the TDSP within four Retail Business Hours, using the 814_21, ESI ID Maintenance Response.  In addition, ERCOT will send all affected CRs notice of the changes using the 814_20 transaction.  The TDSP is responsible for the following data elements:\n(a)\tService Address; city, state, zip, county;\n(b)\tLoad Profile Type;\n(c)\tMeter reading cycle or meter cycle by day of month;\n(d)\tStation ID;\n(e)\tDLF code;\n(f)\tEligibility date;\n(g)\tMeter type;\n(h)\tRate class and sub-class, if applicable;\n(i)\tSpecial needs indicator;\n(j)\tMeter type, identification number, number of dials and role for each meter at the ESI ID, if ESI ID is metered;\n(k)\tFor unmetered ESI IDs, number and description of each unmetered device; \n(l)\tPremise type;\n(m)\tAdvanced Metering System (AMS) or Municipally Owned Utility (MOU) / Electric Cooperative (EC) Non-BUSIDRRQ IDR indicator;\n(n)\tSwitch hold indicator; and\n(o)\tMetered service type description (if provided).\n(2)\tIf the 814_20 transaction is invalid, ERCOT will respond to the TDSP using the 814_21 transaction within four Retail Business Hours of receipt of the 814_20, with the exception of an 814_20 transaction that is invalid because of \u201cESI ID Invalid or Not Found.\u201d  In the case of \u201cESI ID Invalid or Not Found,\u201d ERCOT will hold the 814_20 transaction and continue to retry the request at regular intervals for 48 hours counting only hours on Retail Business Days, but not only Business Hours.  If the request remains invalid for 48 hours, the process will terminate and ERCOT will forward an 814_21 transaction.",

or   \n(b)\tIs an LSIPA Designated Company.  \n(2)\tIf an Entity meets any of the above listed criteria solely due to the citizenship, ownership or headquarters of a wholly owned subsidiary, majority-owned subsidiary, or Affiliate, the Entity will be eligible to register as a Market Participant, subject to paragraph (5) below, if it certifies that the subsidiary or Affiliate at issue will not have direct or remote access to or control of ERCOT\u2019s Wide Area Network (WAN), Market Information System (MIS), or any data from such ERCOT systems. \n(3)\tAny Entity that seeks to register as a Market Participant shall submit an attestation as reflected in Section 23, Form Q, Attestation Regarding Market Participant Citizenship, Ownership, or Headquarters, certifying that the Entity complies with the above criteria, to the best of the Entity\u2019s knowledge and belief following reasonable diligence.\n(4)\tIf there are changes to a Market Participant\u2019s citizenship, ownership, or headquarters such that the Market Participant meets any of the prohibited company citizenship, ownership (including Affiliations) or headquarters criteria of an LSIPA Designated Company, then the Market Participant shall execute and submit a new attestation to ERCOT within ten Business Days of the change becoming effective.\n(5)\tERCOT may immediately suspend or terminate a Market Participant\u2019s registration or access to any of ERCOT\u2019s systems if ERCOT has a reasonable suspicion that the Entity meets any of the criteria described by paragraph (1) above or that an Entity has provided access or control to a subsidiary or Affiliate as described by paragraph (2) above.\n16.1.4\tMarket Participant Reporting of Critical Electric Grid Equipment and Services-Related Purchases\n(1)\tAs a condition of registering and maintaining registration with ERCOT as a Market Participant, an Entity shall report to ERCOT the purchase, lease, or receipt (referred to in this Section as a \u201cpurchase\u201d) of any Critical Electric Grid Equipment (CEGE) or Critical Electric Grid Services (CEGS) that the Entity knows to be from an LSIPA Designated Company or an LSIPA Designated Country.  This includes, but is not limited to, a purchase of CEGE or CEGS that were manufactured, produced, created, or otherwise provided by a company known to the Entity to be an LSIPA Designated Company and subsequently sold to the Entity by a non-LSIPA Designated Company.  \n(a)\tAs used in this Section 16.1.4 and Section 23, Form S, Reporting and Attestation Regarding Purchase of Critical Electric Grid Equipment (CEGE) and Critical Electric Grid Services (CEGS) from a Lone Star Infrastructure Protection Act (LSIPA) Designated Company or LSIPA Designated Country, the terms \u201cknows,\u201d \u201cknown,\u201d and \u201cknowledge\u201d refer to the Entity\u2019s actual knowledge or knowledge that the Entity could have obtained through reasonable inquiry with respect to any clearly evident, non-obscure information indicating that the equipment or service was manufactured, produced, created, or otherwise provided by an LSIPA Designated Company.   \n(b)\tIf the Entity obtains a contractual representation (or either a letter of attestation or a contractual representation if the purchase was made before June 8, 2023) from the seller of CEGE or CEGS that the equipment or services were not manufactured, produced, created, or otherwise provided by an LSIPA Designated Company, then absent some clearly evident, non-obscure information raising such suspicion, this Section 16.1.4 does not require the Entity to conduct diligence or otherwise inquire as to the identity or location of the manufacturer, producer, or creator of the CEGE or CEGS that the Entity purchases or any component parts thereof.  For the avoidance of doubt, this subsection does not create or suggest a requirement not otherwise imposed by this Section 16.1.4.\n(c)\tIf a Market Participant or an Entity applying for registration purchases CEGE from a non-LSIPA Designated Company and clearly evident, non-obscure information indicates that such equipment has a part or component (which itself has routable connectivity) that originated from an LSIPA Designated Company or LSIPA Designated Country, then such part or component shall be reported using Section 23, Form S, but in Subsections 2(a)-(b) of Section 23, Form S, the Entity or Market Participant is only required to provide the following information for the part or component: \n(i)\tA general description of the part or component; \n(ii)\tThe name of the LSIPA Designated Country from which the part or component originated; and \n(iii)\tThe name of the LSIPA Designated Company from which the part or component originated, unless the Market Participant or Entity applying for registration does not actually know the name of the LSIPA Designated Company.  \n(d)\tFor each reported purchase made after June 8, 2023, the Market Participant or Entity applying for registration shall attest that the purchase will not result in access to or control of CEGE by an LSIPA Designated Company or an LSIPA Designated Country, excluding access specifically allowed by the Market Participant or Entity applying for registration for product warranty and support purposes. \n(e)\tFor any purchases made before June 8, 2023, the Market Participant or Entity applying for registration shall take reasonable and necessary actions to mitigate access to or control of its CEGE by a company known to the Entity to be an LSIPA Designated Company or an LSIPA Designated Country, excluding access specifically allowed by the Market Participant or Entity applying for registration for product warranty and support purposes, and shall report those actions to ERCOT on the form reflected in Section 23, Form S. \n(2)\tMarket Participants and Entities applying for registration with ERCOT shall submit an initial report and attestation, on the form reflected in Section 23, Form S identifying any purchase described in paragraph (1) above that occurred during the following time periods:\n(a)\tFor a Market Participant, purchase(s) that were made after June 18, 2021.  This initial report and attestation shall be submitted by October 28, 2024; \n(b)\tFor a Market Participant, purchase(s) that were made between June 8, 2018 through June 18, 2021.  This initial report and attestation shall be submitted by December 15, 2024; and\n(c)\tFor an Entity applying for registration with ERCOT, purchase(s) that were made within the five years preceding the date on which the Entity signed the Standard Form Agreement.  This initial report and attestation must be submitted before ERCOT may approve registration.\n(3)\tA Market Participant shall submit a report and attestation, on the form reflected in Section 23, Form S, identifying any purchase(s) described in paragraph (1) above that occur after the date(s) of the purchases reported pursuant to paragraph (2) above and that have not already been reported pursuant to this Section. \n(4)\tReports and attestations submitted pursuant to paragraph (3) above shall be submitted within 180 days of the date of the  purchase. \n16.2\tRegistration and Qualification of Qualified Scheduling Entities\n16.2.1\tCriteria for Qualification as a Qualified Scheduling Entity \n(1)\tTo become and remain a Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE), an Entity must meet the following requirements:\n(a)\tSubmit a properly completed QSE application for qualification, including any applicable fee, necessary disclosures, and designation of Authorized Representatives, each of whom is responsible for administrative communications with the QSE and each of whom has enough authority to commit and bind the QSE and the Entities it represents;\n(b)\tComply with ERCOT\u2019s background check process, as described in Section 16.2.1.1, QSE Background Check Process;\n(c)\tDemonstrate to ERCOT\u2019s reasonable satisfaction that the Entity does not pose an \u201cUnreasonable Financial Risk\u201d, as defined in this Section;\n(d)\tSign a Standard Form Market Participant Agreement; \n(e)\tSign any required Agreements relating to use of the ERCOT Wide Area Network (WAN), software, and systems;\n(f)\tDemonstrate to ERCOT\u2019s reasonable satisfaction that the Entity is capable of performing the functions of a QSE; \n(g)\tDemonstrate to ERCOT\u2019s reasonable satisfaction that the Entity is capable of complying with the requirements of all ERCOT Protocols and Operating Guides; \n(h)\tSatisfy ERCOT\u2019s creditworthiness requirements as set forth in this Section, unless exempted from these requirements by Section 16.17, Exemption for Qualified Scheduling Entities Participating Only in Emergency Response Service;\n(i)\tBe generally able to pay its debts as they come due.  ERCOT may request evidence of compliance with this qualification only if ERCOT reasonably believes that a QSE is failing to comply with it;\n(j)\tProvide all necessary bank account information and arrange for Fedwire system transfers for two-way confirmation; \n(k)\tBe financially responsible for payment of Settlement charges for those Entities it represents under these Protocols;\n(l)\tSubmit an executed ERCOT Private Wide Area Network (WAN) Agreement under Section 23, Form K, Wide Area Network (WAN) Agreement, for WAN Participants; \n(m)\tComply with the backup plan requirements for WAN Participants, if applicable, in accordance with the Operating Guides; \n(n)\tDemonstrate to ERCOT\u2019s reasonable satisfaction that the Entity can maintain a 24-hour, seven-day-per-week control or operations center with qualified personnel for the purposes of communicating with ERCOT relating to Day-Ahead and Operating Day exchange of market and operational obligations.  This requirement applies to QSEs that are WAN Participants.  Control or operations center personnel must be responsible for operational communications and must have sufficient authority to commit and bind the QSE and the Entities that it represents;\n(o)\tDemonstrate and maintain a working functional interface with all required ERCOT computer systems;\n(p)\tAllow ERCOT, upon reasonable notice, to conduct a site visit to verify information provided by the QSE; and\n(q)\tIf a QSE represents a Resource Entity, Emergency Response Service (ERS) Resource, or another QSE and receives or transmits WAN Data, it must maintain connection to a Secure Private Network (SPN) or equivalent network as described in Nodal Operating Guide Section 7.1.2, WAN Participant Responsibilities.  \n(2)\tIf a QSE chooses to use Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions to receive Settlement Statements and Invoices, it must participate in and successfully complete testing as described in Section 19.8, Retail Market Testing, before starting operations with ERCOT as a QSE.\n(3)\tA QSE must be able to demonstrate to ERCOT\u2019s reasonable satisfaction that it does not pose an Unreasonable Financial Risk.  Unreasonable Financial Risk as used in Section 16, Registration and Qualification of Market Participants, is a risk of financial default posed to ERCOT or its Market Participants by participation of an Entity or its Principals in the ERCOT market.  Indicators of Unreasonable Financial Risk may include, but are not limited to: past market manipulation, trading violations, or other finance-related violations based upon a final adjudication in state or federal regulatory or legal proceedings; financial defaults in ERCOT or other energy markets resulting in losses or uplifts; indications of imminent bankruptcy or insolvency, or other past civil judgement or criminal conviction that reflects problematic behavior on the part of the Entity or its Principals.\n(4)\tA QSE or QSE applicant must be able to demonstrate to ERCOT\u2019s reasonable satisfaction that none of its Principals were or are Principals of any Entity with an outstanding payment obligation that remains owing to ERCOT under any Agreement or these Protocols.  For purposes of this Section, ERCOT will only consider disqualifying those Principals of the QSE or QSE applicant who were Principals of the other Entity at a time during which the unpaid financial obligation remained owing to ERCOT or during the 120-day period prior to the date on which the unpaid financial obligation first became due and owing to ERCOT.\n(5)\tIf any of a QSE\u2019s or QSE applicant\u2019s Principals were or are Principals of a terminated Market Participant with an obligation for Default Uplift Ratio Share allocated under Section 9.19.1, Default Uplift Invoices, the terminated Market Participant must be current on all payment obligations for Default Uplift Invoices in order for the QSE to remain, or QSE applicant to become, a registered QSE.  For purposes of this Section, ERCOT will only consider as disqualifying those Principals of the QSE or QSE applicant who were Principals of the other Entity at a time during which the other Entity was not current on its payment obligation for Default Uplift Invoices or 120 days prior to the date the other Entity first failed to pay a Default Uplift Invoice.\n(6)\tA QSE shall promptly notify ERCOT of any change that a reasonable examiner may deem material to the QSE\u2019s ability to continue to meet the requirements set forth in this Section, and any material change in the information provided by the QSE to ERCOT that may adversely affect the reliability or safety of the ERCOT System or the financial security of ERCOT.  This includes any changes in the Principals of the QSE.  If the QSE fails to so notify ERCOT of such change within two Business Days after becoming aware of the change, then ERCOT may, after providing notice to each Entity represented by the QSE, refuse to allow the QSE to perform as a QSE and take any other action ERCOT deems appropriate, in its sole discretion, to prevent ERCOT or Market Participants from bearing potential or actual risks, financial or otherwise, arising from those changes, and in accordance with these Protocols.  \n(7)\tSubject to the following provisions of this paragraph, a QSE may partition itself into any number of subordinate QSEs (\u201cSubordinate QSEs\u201d).  If a single Entity requests to partition itself into more than four Subordinate QSEs, ERCOT may implement the request subject to ERCOT\u2019s reasonable determination that the additional requested Subordinate QSEs will not be likely to overburden ERCOT\u2019s staffing or systems.  ERCOT shall adopt an implementation plan allowing phased-in registration for these additional Subordinate QSEs in order to mitigate system or staffing impacts.  However, ERCOT may not unreasonably delay that registration. \n(8)\tEach Subordinate QSE must be treated as an individual QSE for all purposes including communications and control functions except for liability, financial security, and financial liability requirements under this Section.  That liability, financial security, and financial liability is cumulative for all Subordinate QSEs for the single Entity signing the QSE Agreement.    \n(9)\tContinued qualification as a QSE is contingent upon compliance with all applicable requirements in these Protocols.  ERCOT may suspend a QSE\u2019s rights as a Market Participant when ERCOT reasonably determines that it is an appropriate remedy for the Entity\u2019s failure to satisfy any applicable requirement.\n(10)\tEach QSE that is a WAN Participant, or its designated QSE agent, shall maintain 24-hour, seven-day-per-week operations and Hotline communications with ERCOT and answer each QSE Hotline call.\n16.2.1.1\tQSE Background Check Process\n(1)\tA QSE applicant must satisfy a background check as a part of the ERCOT registration process.  All background checks will be performed by a third-party acting on ERCOT\u2019s behalf.  Upon ERCOT\u2019s request, a registered QSE may be required to satisfy a background check as a condition of maintaining its ERCOT registration.  \n(2)\tA QSE, QSE applicants, and their Principals, will provide the following disclosures to complete a QSE background check:\n(a)\tAny civil or criminal matters involving the applicant, its predecessors, Affiliates, or Principals within the last ten years that resulted in a conviction or finding of fraud, theft, larceny, deceit, deceptive trade practices, or a violation of securities or customer protection laws;\n(b)\tAny complaint, formal investigation, or disciplinary action concerning financial matters initiated by or with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), a self-regulatory organization, Independent System Operator or Regional Transmission Organization, or a state public utility commission or securities board directly involving the actions of the applicant, its predecessors, Affiliates, or Principals within the last ten years;\n(c)\tAny default involving the applicant, its predecessors, Affiliates, or Principals, that impacted or revoked the right to operate in any other energy market within the last ten years;\n(d)\tAny bankruptcy by the applicant, its predecessors, Affiliates, or Principals within the last ten years; and\n(e)\tAny other information ERCOT deems reasonably necessary to complete a background check (e.g., Social Security Number(s), birth dates, home addresses).  \n(3)\tAs required by paragraph (6) of Section 16.2.1, Criteria for Qualification as a Qualified Scheduling Entity, a QSE, QSE applicants, and their Principals, must promptly provide ERCOT notice of any change that a reasonable examiner could deem material to the QSE\u2019s ability to continue to satisfy the background check requirement, including any change to information that must be disclosed under this Section.\n16.2.1.2\tData Agent-Only Qualified Scheduling Entities\n(1)\tAn Entity may request registration as a Data Agent-Only QSE by submitting a completed Data Agent-Only QSE application.  ERCOT will consider the application and register the Entity as a Data Agent-Only QSE in accordance with the same processes in Section 16.2, Registration and Qualification of Qualified Scheduling Entities, generally applicable to the QSE application process.  \n(2)\tAn Entity is eligible to register as a Data Agent-Only QSE and maintain that registration if it:\n(a)\tMeets all the eligibility criteria to qualify as a QSE under paragraph (1) of Section 16.2.1, Criteria for Qualification as a Qualified Scheduling Entity, except for items (b), (c), (h), (j), (m), and (n);\n(b)\tIs not also registered as a Congestion Revenue Right (CRR) Account Holder;\n(c)\tDoes not participate in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) or Real-Time Market (RTM);\n(d)\tDoes not participate in the ERS market;\n(e)\tDoes not have decision making authority over the Resources for which the Entity provides agency services; and\n(f)\tMaintains a 24-hour, seven-day-per-week support contact with qualified personnel to support and resolve any data or communication issues with ERCOT.  \n(3)\tA registered Data Agent-Only QSE may only be appointed to act as the authorized agent of a QSE that meets all requirements of Section 16.2.1 for the limited purpose of exchanging or communicating certain types of data with ERCOT provided that a QSE Agency Agreement making such appointment has been properly executed by the parties and accepted by ERCOT.  If a Data Agent-Only QSE is appointed as such an agent, it shall perform its agency services in accordance with the terms of the QSE Agency Agreement and the requirements for WAN Participants under the Nodal Operating Guide Section 7, Telemetry and Communication.\n(4)\tA Data Agent-Only QSE shall comply with the obligations applicable to QSEs under this Section 16, Registration and Qualification of Market Participants, but is exempt from the following requirements:\n(a)\tParagraph (1)(b) of Section 16.2.1;\n(b)\tParagraph (1)(c) of Section 16.2.1;\n(c)\tParagraph (1)(h) of Section 16.2.1;\n(d)\tParagraph (1)(j) of Section 16.2.1;\n(e)\tParagraph (1)(m) of Section 16.2.1;\n(f)\tParagraph (1)(n) of Section 16.2.1;\n(g)\tSection 16.11, Financial Security for Counter-Parties; and\n(h)\tSection 16.16, Additional Counter-Party Qualification Requirements.\n(5)\tERCOT will ensure that its systems prevent participation by a Data Agent-Only QSE in the DAM and RTM.\n(6)\tA Data Agent-Only QSE may request to change its registration to a QSE that meets all the requirements of Section 16.2.1 and is registered with ERCOT as such by submitting a written request to ERCOT.  ERCOT will change the Data Agent-Only QSE\u2019s registration upon satisfaction of all requirements in Section 16.2.1.\n(7)\tNothing in this Section affects a Data Agent-Only QSE\u2019s obligation under paragraph (6) of Section 16.2.1 to provide ERCOT notice of any material change that could adversely affect the reliability or safety of the ERCOT System.\n(8)\tEach Data Agent-Only QSE shall maintain 24-hour, seven-day-per-week operations and Hotline communications with ERCOT and answer each QSE Hotline call.\n16.2.2\tQSE Application Process  \n(1)\tTo register as a QSE, an applicant must submit to ERCOT a completed Section 23, Form G, QSE Application and Service Filing for Registration Form, and any applicable fee.  ERCOT shall post on the ERCOT website the form in which QSE applications must be submitted, all materials that must be provided with the QSE application and the fee schedule, if any, applicable to QSE applications.  The QSE application shall be attested to by a duly authorized officer or agent of the applicant.  The QSE applicant shall promptly notify ERCOT of any material changes affecting a pending application using the appropriate form posted on the ERCOT website.  The application must be submitted at least 60 days before the proposed date of commencement of service.\n16.2.2.1\tNotice of Receipt of Qualified Scheduling Entity Application\n(1)\tWithin three Business Days after receiving a QSE application, ERCOT shall issue to the applicant a written confirmation that ERCOT has received the QSE application.  ERCOT shall return without review any QSE application that does not include the proper application fee.  The remainder of this Section does not apply to any QSE application returned for failure to include the proper application fee.\n16.2.2.2\tIncomplete QSE Applications  \n(1)\tWithin ten Business Days after receiving a QSE application, ERCOT shall notify the applicant in writing if the application is incomplete.  An application will not be deemed complete until ERCOT has received all information necessary to conduct an evaluation of whether the applicant satisfies the requirements to be registered as a QSE, including information necessary to complete any background checks. \n(2)\tIf a QSE application is incomplete, ERCOT\u2019s notice of incompletion to the applicant must explain the deficiencies and describe the additional information necessary to make the QSE application complete.  The QSE applicant has five Business Days after it receives the notice, or a longer period if ERCOT allows, to provide the additional required information. \n(3)\tIf the applicant does not respond to the incompletion notice within the time allotted, ERCOT shall reject the application and shall notify the applicant using the procedures below. \n(4)\tERCOT will notify the applicant of the date on which the application is deemed complete.\n16.2.2.3\tERCOT Approval or Rejection of Qualified Scheduling Entity Application\n(1)\tERCOT will approve or reject a QSE application within 60 days after the application has been deemed complete as provided for in Section 16.2.2.2, Incomplete QSE Applications, unless ERCOT determines that additional time is needed to complete its review of the application.  ERCOT will notify the applicant when additional time is needed to complete its review and will provide a date by which ERCOT expects to complete its review.  If ERCOT\u2019s initial evaluation indicates that there may be a basis to reject the application, ERCOT may contact the applicant prior to rendering a final decision on the application to determine if further information can be provided by the applicant to resolve the identified concern.\n(2)\tIf ERCOT rejects a QSE application, ERCOT shall send the applicant a rejection letter explaining the grounds upon which ERCOT rejected the QSE application.  Appropriate grounds for rejecting a QSE application include the following:\n(a)\tRequired information is not provided to ERCOT in the allotted time;\n(b)\tNoncompliance with technical requirements; and\n(c)\tNoncompliance with other specific eligibility requirements in this Section or in any other Protocols.\n(3)\tNot later than ten Business Days after receiving a rejection letter, the QSE applicant may challenge the rejection of its QSE application using the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 20, Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedure.  The applicant may submit a new QSE application and fee at any time, and ERCOT shall process the new QSE application under this Section.\n(4)\tIf ERCOT approves the QSE application, ERCOT shall send the applicant a Standard Form Market Participant Agreement and any other required Agreements relating to use of the ERCOT network, software, and systems for the applicant\u2019s signature.\n(5)\tIf ERCOT fails to approve or deny the QSE application within 60 days after the application is deemed complete, and also fails to notify the applicant that additional time is needed to complete its review, the QSE applicant may seek relief using the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 20.\n16.2.3\tRemaining Steps for Qualified Scheduling Entity Registration\n(1)\tAfter a QSE application is deemed approved under Section 16.2.2.3, ERCOT Approval or Rejection of Qualified Scheduling Entity Application, the applicant shall coordinate or perform the following:\n(a)\tReturn the signed Standard Form Market Participant Agreement and other related agreements to ERCOT;\n(b)\tCoordinate with ERCOT and other Entities, as necessary, to test all communications necessary to participate in the market in the ERCOT Region;\n(c)\tIf applicable, a QSE offering services in a Non-Opt-In Entity (NOIE) service territory must obtain written authorization from the NOIE, and submit such authorization to ERCOT; and\n[PIR005:  ERCOT Protocol Interpretation of paragraph (1)(c) of Section 16.2.3 above:]\nOn June 29, 2021, ERCOT issued a Protocol Interpretation regarding the applicability of paragraph (1)(c) of Section 16.2.3 to QSEs representing Energy Storage Resources. See Market Notice M-A062921-01, Protocol Interpretation Regarding Necessity of Non-Opt-In Entity Consent to Qualified Scheduling Entity Representation of Energy Storage Resource in Non-Opt-In Entity Service Territory, at http://www.ercot.com/mktrules/nprotocols/pir_process.html for full details of this Protocol Interpretation.\n(d)\tDemonstrate compliance with security and financial requirements.\n16.2.3.1\tProcess to Gain Approval to Follow DSR Load\n(1)\tEach QSE wanting to use Resources to follow Dynamically Scheduled Resource (DSR) Load shall submit a proposal to ERCOT for analysis of the feasibility and reliability of the telemetry required by the proposal.  ERCOT shall either approve or disapprove that proposal based on ERCOT\u2019s ability to monitor the DSR Load behavior.\n(2)\tEach DSR Load must be associated with a Load meter or group of Load meters.  This includes Load that is calculated by subtracting interchange telemetry from actual generation telemetry, appropriately adjusted for Transmission and Distribution Losses.\n[NPRR1000:  Delete Section 16.2.3.1 above upon system implementation and renumber accordingly.]\n16.2.3.2\tMaintaining and Updating QSE Information \n(1)\tEach QSE must timely update information the QSE provided to ERCOT in the application process, and a QSE must promptly respond to any reasonable request by ERCOT for updated information regarding the QSE or the information provided to ERCOT by the QSE, including:\n(a)\tThe QSE\u2019s addresses;\n(b)\tA list of Principals, as defined in Section 16.1.2, Principal of a Market Participant;\n(c)\tA list of Affiliates; and\n(d)\tDesignation of the QSE\u2019s officers, directors, Authorized Representatives, Credit Contacts, and User Security Administrator (USA) (all per the QSE application) including the telephone and e-mail addresses for those persons. \n16.2.3.3\tQualified Scheduling Entity Service Termination\n(1)\tIf a QSE intends to terminate representation of a Resource Entity that owns or controls a Resource that is in the ERCOT Network Operations Model (other than a Resource Entity serving as its own QSE, in which case this Section does not apply), the QSE shall provide, no less than 45 days before the specified effective termination date (\u201cTermination Date\u201d), written notice to ERCOT and the Resource.\n(2)\tIf a QSE intends to terminate representation of a Load Serving Entity (LSE) or a Resource Entity that does not own or control a Resource that is in the ERCOT Network Operations Model (other than an LSE or Resource Entity serving as its own QSE, in which case this Section does not apply), the QSE shall provide, no less than 12 Business Days before the specified effective Termination Date, written notice to ERCOT and the LSE or Resource Entity.\n(3)\tEffective at 2400 on the Termination Date specified by the QSE, the QSE may no longer provide QSE services for or represent the terminated LSE or Resource.  The QSE is responsible for settlement obligations that the QSE has incurred on behalf of the terminated LSE or Resource before the termination.  The QSE must participate in Real-Time Operations through the Termination Date and provide updates pursuant to these Protocols for the Operating Day which is the Termination Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, before the Termination Date, the LSE/Resource: \n(a)\tAffiliates itself with a new QSE, or \n(b)\tFulfills ERCOT\u2019s creditworthiness requirements in order to become an Emergency QSE,\nthe QSE that provided notice of the intent to terminate representation of the LSE/ Resource will no longer be responsible for the terminated LSE/Resource upon the effective date of the new QSE\u2019s representation of that LSE/Resource, or the LSE/Resource qualifying as an Emergency QSE.\n(4)\tWithin two Business Days of notice of a QSE\u2019s intent to terminate representation of an LSE, ERCOT shall notify the LSE of the level of credit the LSE must provide, if it becomes an Emergency QSE, and the date by which it must post the required collateral.\n16.2.4\tPosting of Qualified Scheduling Entity List\n(1)\tERCOT shall post on the ERCOT website and maintain a current list of all QSEs.  ERCOT shall include with that posting a cautionary statement that inclusion on that list does not necessarily mean that a QSE is entitled to provide any service to a third party, nor does it obligate a QSE to provide any service to a third party.\n16.2.5\tSuspended or Terminated Qualified Scheduling Entity \u2013 Notification to LSEs and Resource Entities Represented\n(1)\tIf ERCOT suspends a QSE or terminates the QSE\u2019s Standard Form Market Participant Agreement for Default, ERCOT shall notify the affected LSEs and Resource Entities that the QSE has been suspended or terminated and the effective date of such suspension or termination.  \n(2)\tIf an LSE or Resource Entity represented by a terminated or suspended QSE is the same Entity as the terminated or suspended QSE, the provisions of Section 16.11.6.1.6, Revocation of a Market Participant\u2019s Rights and Termination of Agreements, shall apply to that LSE or Resource Entity, and that LSE or Resource Entity shall not be entitled to become an Emergency QSE.\n16.2.6\tEmergency Qualified Scheduling Entity\n16.2.6.1\tDesignation as an Emergency Qualified Scheduling Entity or Virtual Qualified Scheduling Entity\n(1)\tA \u201cVirtual QSE\u201d is defined as an LSE or Resource Entity that has not qualified and been designated as an Emergency QSE, but has been designated by ERCOT to temporarily perform the responsibilities of a QSE. \n(2)\tIf a QSE has given Notice of its intent to terminate its relationship with an LSE or Resource Entity, that LSE or Resource Entity, must, by noon on the fourth Business Day after the termination notice date, either:\n(a) \tDesignate a new QSE with such relationship to take effect on the Termination Date, or earlier if allowed by ERCOT; or\n(b) \tSatisfy all necessary creditworthiness requirements for QSEs as described in Section 16.2, Registration and Qualification of Qualified Scheduling Entities, and operate as an Emergency QSE as described below.  \n(3)\tIf ERCOT has given Notice of an LSE\u2019s or Resource Entity\u2019s QSE\u2019s termination or suspension, that LSE or Resource Entity will be designated as a Virtual QSE for up to two Bank Business Days, during which time it must either: \n\t(a) \tDesignate and begin operations with a new QSE; or\n(b) \tSatisfy all necessary creditworthiness requirements for QSEs as described in Section 16.2, and operate as an Emergency QSE as described below.

If the applicant timely responds to ERCOT\u2019s notice with the required additional information, then the application is deemed complete on the date that ERCOT receives the applicant\u2019s response. \n(3)\tIf the applicant does not timely respond to ERCOT\u2019s notice, then the application must be rejected, and ERCOT shall retain any application fee included with the application.\n16.5.2.3\tERCOT Approval or Rejection of a Resource Entity Application\n(1)\tERCOT may reject a Resource Entity application within ten Business Days after the application has been deemed complete in accordance with this Section.  If ERCOT does not reject the Resource Entity application within ten Business Days after the application is deemed complete then the application is deemed approved.\n(2)\tIf ERCOT rejects a Resource Entity application, ERCOT shall send the Resource Entity applicant a rejection letter explaining the grounds upon which ERCOT rejected the Resource Entity application.  Appropriate grounds for rejecting a Resource Entity application include the following:\n(a)\tRequired information is not provided to ERCOT in the allotted time;\n(b)\tNoncompliance with technical requirements; and\n(c)\tNoncompliance with other specific eligibility requirements set forth in this Section or in any other part of these Protocols.\n(3)\tNot later than ten Business Days after receiving a rejection letter, the Resource Entity applicant may challenge the rejection of its Resource Entity application using the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 20, Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedure.

For the Resource Entity that owns or operates a Resource, the Resource Entity\u2019s QSE designation must be submitted to ERCOT no later than 45 days before the effective date of the change, unless otherwise approved by ERCOT, before the Resource Entity will be evaluated for compliance with the requirements of paragraph (3) below.  ERCOT shall notify the Resource Entity of approval or disapproval as soon as practicable after receipt of the request.\n(3)\tFor Resources required by these Protocols to be in the Network Operations Model, the following apply:\n(a)\tThe designated QSE shall install all telemetry required of these Protocols for the requesting Resource Entity and schedule point-to-point data verification with ERCOT.  \n(b)\tThe designated QSE shall submit telemetry data descriptions to ERCOT to meet ERCOT\u2019s normal model update process.\n(c)\tThe Resource must submit any changes in system topology or telemetry according to Section 3.3.2.1, Information to Be Provided to ERCOT.  \n(d)\tThe effective date for the newly designated QSE shall be in accordance with Section 3.10.1, Time Line for Network Operations Model Changes.  \n(e)\tERCOT may request the Resource Entity to develop a transition implementation plan to be approved by ERCOT that sets appropriate deadlines for completion of all required data and telemetry verification and cutover testing activities with ERCOT.\n(4)\tFor all other Resources, the new QSE designation is to be received no less than six days prior to the effective date.  \n(5)\tWithin two days of approving a Resource Entity\u2019s notice, ERCOT shall notify all affected Entities, including the Resource Entity\u2019s current QSE, of the effective date of the change.  \n16.5.4\tMaintaining and Updating Resource Entity Information \n(1)\tEach Resource Entity must timely update information the Resource Entity provided to ERCOT in the application process, and a Resource Entity must promptly respond to any reasonable request by ERCOT for updated information regarding the Resource Entity or the information provided to ERCOT by the Resource Entity, including:\n(a)\tThe Resource Entity\u2019s addresses;\n(b)\tA list of Affiliates; and\n(c)\tDesignation of the Resource Entity\u2019s officers, directors, Authorized Representatives, and USA (all per the Resource Entity application) including the telephone and e-mail addresses for those persons.\n(2)\tA Resource Entity that has a Switchable Generation Resource (SWGR) shall submit a report to ERCOT in writing indicating whether or not it has any contractual requirement in a non-ERCOT Control Area for each season as defined in Section 3.2.6.4, Total Capacity Estimates, which may cause the identified capacity to not be available to the ERCOT System for the subsequent ten years.  The initial communication and subsequent updates to previously reported unavailable capacity shall be filed with ERCOT as soon as possible, but in no event later than ten Business Days after the information is obtained.  The communications should reflect the Resource Entity\u2019s best estimate of the required information at the time the filing is made.  ERCOT shall use the provided data for preparation of the Report on Capacity, Demand and Reserves in the ERCOT Region (CDR) and other planning purposes.  The SWGR information reporting form is located on the ERCOT website.\n16.6\tRegistration of Municipally Owned Utilities and Electric Cooperatives in the ERCOT Region\n(1)\tEach Municipally Owned Utility (MOU) and Electric Cooperative (EC) shall register with ERCOT and sign the Agreements that apply to the functions it performs in the ERCOT Region, regardless of whether planning to be a Non-Opt-In Entity (NOIE) or a Competitive Retailer (CR).\n(2)\tIf an MOU or EC decides to register an affiliate as a CR, it must notify ERCOT of its intentions six months prior to opting in.  \n(3)\tEach MOU and EC shall assign an Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID) to each NOIE wholesale point of delivery as specified in these Protocols.  The ESI IDs must be assigned to a Load Serving Entity (LSE).\n16.7\tRegistration of Renewable Energy Credit Account Holders\n(1)\tEach Entity intending to participate in the Renewable Energy Credit (REC) program shall register with ERCOT and execute a Standard Form Market Participant Agreement (as provided in Section 22, Attachment A, Standard Form Market Participant Agreement) prior to participation in the REC program.\n16.8\tRegistration and Qualification of Congestion Revenue Rights Account Holders\n16.8.1\tCriteria for Qualification as a CRR Account Holder \n(1)\tTo become and remain a Congestion Revenue Right (CRR) Account Holder, an Entity must meet the following requirements: \n(a)\tSubmit a properly completed CRR Account Holder application (Section 23, Form A, Congestion Revenue Right (CRR) Account Holder Application for Registration) for qualification, including any applicable fee, any necessary disclosures, and designation of Authorized Representatives, each of whom is responsible for administrative communications with the CRR Account Holder and each of whom has enough authority to commit and bind the CRR Account Holder;\n(b)\tComply with ERCOT\u2019s background check process, as described in Section 16.8.1.1, CRR Account Holder Background Check Process;\n(c)\tDemonstrate to ERCOT\u2019s reasonable satisfaction that the Entity does not pose an \u201cUnreasonable Financial Risk\u201d, as described in this Section;\n(d)\tSign a CRR Account Holder Agreement; \n(e)\tSign any required Agreements relating to use of the ERCOT network, software, and systems;\n(f)\tDemonstrate to ERCOT\u2019s reasonable satisfaction that the Entity is capable of performing the functions of a CRR Account Holder; \n(g)\tDemonstrate to ERCOT\u2019s reasonable satisfaction that the Entity is capable of complying with the requirements of all ERCOT Protocols and Operating Guides; \n(h)\tSatisfy ERCOT\u2019s creditworthiness requirements as set forth in this Section;\n(i)\tBe generally able to pay its debts as they come due; ERCOT may request evidence of compliance with this qualification only if ERCOT reasonably believes that a CRR Account Holder is failing to comply with it;\n(j)\tProvide all necessary bank account information and arrange for Fedwire system transfers for two-way confirmation; \n(k)\tBe financially responsible for payment of its Settlement charges under these Protocols; and\n(l)\tNot be an unbundled Transmission Service Provider (TSP), Distribution Service Provider (DSP), or an ERCOT employee.\n(2)\tA CRR Account Holder must be able to demonstrate to ERCOT\u2019s reasonable satisfaction that it does not pose an Unreasonable Financial Risk.  Unreasonable Financial Risk as used in Section 16, Registration and Qualification of Market Participants, is a risk of financial default posed to ERCOT or its Market Participants by participation of an Entity or its Principals in the ERCOT market.  Indicators of Unreasonable Financial Risk may include, but are not limited to: past market manipulation, trading violations, or other finance-related violations based upon a final adjudication in state or federal regulatory or legal proceedings; financial defaults in ERCOT or other energy markets resulting in losses or uplifts; indications of imminent bankruptcy or insolvency, or other past civil judgement or criminal conviction that reflects problematic behavior on the part of the Entity or its Principals.\n(3)\tA CRR Account Holder or CRR Account Holder applicant must be able to demonstrate to ERCOT\u2019s reasonable satisfaction that none of its Principals were or are Principals of any Entity with an outstanding payment obligation that remains owing to ERCOT under any Agreement or these Protocols.  For purposes of this Section, ERCOT will only consider disqualifying those Principals of the CRR Account Holder or CRR Account Holder applicant who were Principals of the other Entity at a time during which the unpaid financial obligation remained owing to ERCOT or during the 120-day period prior to the date on which the unpaid financial obligation first became due and owing to ERCOT.\n(4)\tIf any of a CRR Account Holder\u2019s or CRR Account Holder applicant\u2019s Principals were or are Principals of a terminated Market Participant with an obligation for Default Uplift Ratio Share allocated under Section 9.19.1, Default Uplift Invoices, the terminated Market Participant must be current on all payment obligations for Default Uplift Invoices in order for the CRR Account Holder to remain, or CRR Account Holder applicant to become, a registered CRR Account Holder.  For purposes of this Section, ERCOT will only consider as disqualifying those Principals of the CRR Account Holder or CRR Account Holder applicant who were Principals of the other Entity at a time during which the other Entity was not current on its payment obligation for Default Uplift Invoices or 120 days prior to the date the other Entity first failed to pay a Default Uplift Invoice.\n(5)\tA CRR Account Holder shall promptly notify ERCOT of any material change that a reasonable examiner could deem material to the CRR Account Holder\u2019s ability to continue to meet the requirements set forth in paragraphs (1) to (4) above, and any material change in the information provided by the CRR Account Holder to ERCOT that may adversely affect the financial security of ERCOT.  This includes any changes in the Principals of the CRR Account Holder.  If the CRR Account Holder fails to so notify ERCOT of the following within two Business Days after becoming aware of the change, then ERCOT may refuse to allow the CRR Account Holder to continue to perform as a CRR Account Holder and take any other action ERCOT deems appropriate, in its sole discretion, to prevent ERCOT or Market Participants from bearing potential or actual risks, financial or otherwise, arising from those changes, and in accordance with these Protocols. \n(6)\tContinued qualification as a CRR Account Holder is contingent upon compliance with all applicable requirements in these Protocols.  ERCOT may suspend a CRR Account Holder\u2019s rights as a Market Participant when ERCOT reasonably determines that it is an appropriate remedy for the Entity\u2019s failure to satisfy any applicable requirement.\n16.8.1.1\tCRR Account Holder Background Check Process\n(1)\tCRR Account Holder applicants must satisfy a background check as a part of the ERCOT registration process.  All background checks will be performed by a third-party acting on ERCOT\u2019s behalf.  Upon ERCOT\u2019s request, a registered CRR Account Holder may be required to satisfy a background check as a condition of maintaining its ERCOT registration.\n(2)\tA CRR Account Holder, CRR Account Holder applicants, and their Principals, will provide the following disclosures to complete a CRR Account Holder background check:\n(a)\tAny civil or criminal matters involving the applicant, its predecessors, Affiliates, or Principals within the last ten years that resulted in a conviction or finding of fraud, theft, larceny, deceit, deceptive trade practices, or a violation of securities or customer protection laws;\n(b)\tAny complaint, formal investigation, or disciplinary action concerning financial matters initiated by or with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), a self-regulatory organization, Independent System Operator or Regional Transmission Organization, or a state public utility commission or securities board directly involving the actions of the applicant, its predecessors, Affiliates, or Principals within the last ten years;\n(c)\tAny default involving the applicant, its predecessors, Affiliates, or Principals, that impacted or revoked the right to operate in any other energy market within the last ten years;\n(d)\tAny bankruptcy by the applicant, its predecessors, Affiliates, or Principals within the last ten years; and\n(e)\tAny other information ERCOT deems reasonably necessary to complete a background check (e.g., Social Security Number(s), birth dates, home addresses).  \n(3)\tAs required by paragraph (5) of Section 16.8.1, Criteria for Qualification as a CRR Account Holder, a CRR Account Holder, CRR Account Holder applicants, and their Principals, must promptly provide ERCOT notice of any change that a reasonable examiner could deem material to the CRR Account Holder\u2019s ability to continue to satisfy the background check requirement, including any change to information that must be disclosed. \n16.8.2\tCRR Account Holder Application Process  \n(1)\tTo register as a CRR Account Holder, an applicant must submit to ERCOT a completed Section 23, Form A, Congestion Revenue Right (CRR) Account Holder Application for Registration, and any applicable fee.  ERCOT shall post on the ERCOT website the form in which CRR Account Holder applications must be submitted, all materials that must be provided with the CRR Account Holder application and the fee schedule, if any, applicable to CRR Account Holder applications.  The CRR Account Holder application shall be attested to by a duly authorized officer or agent of the applicant.  The CRR Account Holder applicant shall promptly notify ERCOT of any material changes affecting a pending application using the appropriate form posted on the ERCOT website.  The application must be submitted at least 60 days before the first day of participation in the CRR Auction process or purchase of CRRs.\n16.8.2.1\tNotice of Receipt of CRR Account Holder Application\n(1)\tWithin three Business Days after receiving a CRR Account Holder application, ERCOT shall issue to the applicant a written confirmation that ERCOT has received the CRR Account Holder application.  ERCOT shall return without review any CRR Account Holder application that does not include the proper application fee.  The remainder of this Section does not apply to any CRR Account Holder application returned for failure to include the proper application fee.\n16.8.2.2\tIncomplete CRR Account Holder Applications  \n(1)\tWithin ten Business Days after receiving a CRR Account Holder application, ERCOT shall notify the applicant in writing if the application is incomplete.  An application will not be deemed complete until ERCOT has received all information necessary to conduct an evaluation of whether the applicant satisfies the requirements to be registered as a CRR Account Holder, including information necessary to complete any needed background checks.\n(2)\tIf a CRR Account Holder application is incomplete, ERCOT\u2019s notice of incompletion to the applicant must explain the deficiencies and describe the additional information necessary to make the CRR Account Holder application complete.  The CRR Account Holder applicant has five Business Days after it receives the notice, or a longer period if ERCOT allows, to provide the additional required information.\n(3)\tIf the applicant does not respond to the incompletion notice within the time allotted, ERCOT shall reject the application and shall notify the applicant using the procedures below.\n(4)\tERCOT will notify the applicant of the date on which the application is deemed complete.\n16.8.2.3\tERCOT Approval or Rejection of CRR Account Holder Application\n(1)\tERCOT will approve or reject a CRR Account Holder application within 60 days after the application has been deemed complete as provided for in Section 16.8.2.2, Incomplete CRR Account Holder Applications, unless ERCOT determines that additional time is needed to complete its review of the application.  ERCOT will notify the applicant when additional time is needed to complete its review and will provide a date by which ERCOT expects to complete its review.  If ERCOT\u2019s initial evaluation indicates that there may be a basis to reject the application, ERCOT may contact the applicant prior to rendering a final decision on the application to determine if further information can be provided by the applicant to resolve the identified concern.\n(2)\tIf ERCOT rejects a CRR Account Holder application, ERCOT shall send the applicant a rejection letter explaining the grounds upon which ERCOT rejected the CRR Account Holder application.  Appropriate grounds for rejecting a CRR Account Holder application include the following:\n(a)\tRequired information is not provided to ERCOT in the allotted time;\n(b)\tNoncompliance with technical requirements; and\n(c)\tNoncompliance with other specific eligibility requirements in this Section or in any other Protocols.\n(3)\tNot later than ten Business Days after receiving a rejection letter, the CRR Account Holder applicant may challenge the rejection of its CRR Account Holder application using the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 20, Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedure.  The applicant may submit a new CRR Account Holder application and fee at any time, and ERCOT shall process the new CRR Account Holder application under this Section.\n(4)\tIf ERCOT approves the CRR Account Holder application, ERCOT shall send the applicant a CRR Account Holder Agreement and any other required Agreements relating to use of the ERCOT network, software, and systems for the applicant\u2019s signature. \n(5)\tIf ERCOT fails to approve or deny the CRR Account Holder application within 60 days after the application is deemed complete, and fails to notify the applicant that additional time is needed to complete its review, the CRR Account Holder may seek relief using the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 20.\n16.8.3\tRemaining Steps for CRR Account Holder Registration\n(1)\tAfter a CRR Account Holder application is deemed approved under Section 16.8.2.3, ERCOT Approval or Rejection of CRR Account Holder Application, the applicant shall coordinate or perform the following:\n(a)\tReturn the signed CRR Account Holder Agreement and other related agreements to ERCOT; and\n(b)\tDemonstrate compliance with security and financial requirements.\n16.8.3.1\tMaintaining and Updating CRR Account Holder Information \n(1)\tEach CRR Account Holder must timely update information the CRR Account Holder provided to ERCOT in the application process, and a CRR Account Holder must promptly respond to any reasonable request by ERCOT for updated information regarding the CRR Account Holder or the information provided to ERCOT by the CRR Account Holder, including:\n(a)\tThe CRR Account Holder\u2019s addresses;\n(b)\tA list of Principals;\n(c)\tA list of Affiliates; and\n(d)\tDesignation of the CRR Account Holder\u2019s officers, directors, Authorized Representatives, Credit Contacts, and User Security Administrator (USA) (all per the CRR Account Holder application) including the telephone and e-mail addresses for those persons. \n16.9\tResources Providing Reliability Must-Run Service\n(1)\tAny Entity providing Reliability Must-Run (RMR) Service must comply with all the requirements to become a Resource Entity under this Section and must sign an RMR Agreement (Section 22, Attachment B, Standard Form Reliability Must-Run Agreement).  \n16.10\tResources Providing Black Start Service\n(1)\tAny Entity providing Black Start Service must comply with all the requirements to become a Resource Entity under this Section and must sign a Standard Form Black Start Agreement (Section 22, Attachment D, Standard Form Black Start Agreement). \n16.11\tFinancial Security for Counter-Parties\n(1)\tThe term \u201cFinancial Security\u201d in this Section means the collateral amount posted with ERCOT in any of the forms listed in Section 16.11.3, Alternative Means of Satisfying ERCOT Creditworthiness Requirements.\n(2)\tThe term \u201cRemainder Collateral\u201d in this Section means the Financial Security minus Total Potential Exposure Secured (TPES) minus Net Positive Exposure of approved Congestion Revenue Right (CRR) Bilateral Trades minus Available Credit Limit (ACL) locked for CRR Auction, calculated in accordance with paragraph (3) of Section 16.11.4.6.1, Credit Requirements for CRR Auction Participation. \n(3)\tThe term \u201cUltimate Parent\u201d in this Section is defined as the most distant parent that prepares consolidated financial statements within the hierarchical ownership structure.\n16.11.1\tERCOT Creditworthiness Requirements for Counter-Parties \n(1)\tEach Counter-Party shall meet ERCOT\u2019s creditworthiness standards as provided in this Section.  A Counter-Party must, at all times, maintain its Financial Security at or above the amount of its Total Potential Exposure (TPE).  Each Counter-Party shall maintain any required Financial Security in a form acceptable to ERCOT in its sole discretion.  If at any time the Counter-Party does not meet ERCOT\u2019s creditworthiness requirements, then ERCOT may suspend the Counter-Party\u2019s rights under these Protocols until it meets those creditworthiness requirements.  ERCOT\u2019s failure to suspend the Counter-Party\u2019s rights on any particular occasion does not prevent ERCOT from suspending those rights on any subsequent occasion, including a CRR Account Holder\u2019s ability to bid on future CRRs or a Qualified Scheduling Entity\u2019s (QSE\u2019s) ability to bid in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM).\n(2)\tNotwithstanding the provisions in paragraph (1) above, ERCOT may draw on Financial Security if necessary to pay short-pays of Securitization Default Charge Invoices or Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoices if the respective escrow deposits are insufficient to cover the short-pays.\n16.11.1.1\tReview of Counter-Party Eligibility\n(1)\tAt any time, ERCOT may conduct a review to determine if a Counter-Party continues to satisfy all requirements set forth in Section 16, Registration and Qualification of Market Participants.  \n(2)\tERCOT\u2019s review under this Section may be triggered by notice of a change provided by the Counter-Party to ERCOT, information that ERCOT receives or discovers through other means, or ERCOT\u2019s periodic review of Principals of Counter-Parties.  \n(3)\tAs part of ERCOT\u2019s review under this Section, ERCOT may conduct additional background checks, as described in Section 16.2.1.1, QSE Background Check Process, and Section 16.8.1.1, CRR Account Holder Background Check Process.  ERCOT will charge the Counter-Party a new background check fee for any necessary background check.  A Counter-Party\u2019s failure to pay a background check fee by the deadline set by ERCOT constitutes a \u201cPayment Breach\u201d pursuant to Section 16.11.6, Payment Breach and Late Payments by Market Participants. \n(4)\tIf ERCOT conducts a review pursuant to this Section and determines that the Counter-Party may no longer satisfy a requirement set forth in Section 16, ERCOT, in its sole discretion, may consult with the Counter-Party to determine if the Counter-Party can provide additional information or take remedial action that would explain or resolve the deficiencies preliminarily identified by ERCOT in its review.\n16.11.1.1.1\tFailure to Maintain Eligibility\n(1)\tIf ERCOT\u2019s review of a Counter-Party pursuant to Section 16.2.1.1, QSE Background Check Process, or Section 16.8.1.1, CRR Account Holder Background Check Process, results in ERCOT determining that the Counter-Party no longer satisfies a requirement set forth in Section 16, Registration and Qualification of Market Participants, then ERCOT will notify the Counter-Party that such failure to comply with the ERCOT Protocols is a material breach under Section (8)(A)(2) of the Standard Form Market Participant Agreement (Section 22, Attachment A).  ERCOT will provide the Counter-Party with specific information concerning what is required to cure the material breach. \n(2)\tIf ERCOT determines, in its sole discretion, that continued participation of the Counter-Party would pose a risk that could immediately compromise the integrity of the ERCOT market during the 14-day cure period described in Section (8)(A)(2) of the Standard Form Market Participant Agreement, ERCOT may suspend the Counter-Party\u2019s rights as a Market Participant upon the notification of the material breach.\n16.11.2\t[RESERVED]\n16.11.3\tAlternative Means of Satisfying ERCOT Creditworthiness Requirements\n(1)\tA Counter-Party required to provide Financial Security under these Protocols may do so through one or more of the following means:\n(a)\tThe Counter-Party may give an unconditional, irrevocable letter of credit naming ERCOT as the beneficiary.  ERCOT may, in its sole discretion, reject the letter of credit if the issuer is unacceptable to ERCOT or if the conditions under which ERCOT may draw against the letter of credit are unacceptable to ERCOT.  \n\tThe letter of credit must be given using the ERCOT Board-approved standard letter of credit form.\n\tAll letters of credit must be drawn on a U.S. domestic bank or a U.S. domestic office of a foreign bank.\n(iii)\tLetters of credit must be issued by a bank or other financial institution that is acceptable to ERCOT, with a minimum rating of A- with S&P and Fitch and A3 with Moody\u2019s.  No letters of credit will be accepted from banks which are rated below A-/A3 by one or more rating agencies.  If there are split ratings amongst rating agencies, ERCOT will use the lowest of different ratings within the same rating agency and amongst different rating agencies.  The ratings are defined as follows (if available): Long term issuer rating, Long term Senior Unsecured rating or Long Term Counterparty Risk Assessment (for Moody\u2019s).  For U.S. offices of foreign banks, U.S. branch/office must have an acceptable rating on its own by at least one of the rating agencies.\n(iv)\tLetters of credit are subject to an overall limit per letter of credit issuer for all ERCOT Counter-Parties as determined below: \nIf the issuing entity has\tThen\nLong-Term or Issuer Rating\tMaximum letter of credit issuer limit as a percentage of Tangible Net Worth of issuer\nS&P or Fitch\tMoody\u2019s\t\nAAA\tAaa\t2.00%\nAA+\tAa1\t1.90%\nAA\tAa2\t1.80%\nAA-\tAa3\t1.70%\nA+\tA1\t1.60%\nA\tA2\t1.50%\nA-\tA3\t1.40%\nBelow A-\tBelow A3\tNot accepted\n(A)\tEach letter of credit issuer limit is also subject to an overall limit of $750 million per issuer.\n(B)\tEach Bank Business Day, ERCOT will issue a report of each letter of credit issuer detailing the issuer\u2019s dollar amount of the letters of credit currently issued to ERCOT, the issuer\u2019s computed aggregate concentration limit, and the unused capacity under that limit.  Market Participants may inquire of ERCOT about intra-day changes to the amount of posted letters of credit.\n(C)\tIf a letter of credit issuer limit is breached, Counter-Parties utilizing that issuer will be notified and no new letters of credit from the issuer will be accepted while the limit remains breached.\n(D)\tAfter four months of the limit in breach, ERCOT will no longer accept new letters of credit or amendments to existing letters of credit from that issuer.\n(E)\tLetters of credit held as collateral at the time of an issuer limit breach will not be rejected.\n(F)\tERCOT in its sole discretion may authorize exceptions to these limits.  \n(G)\tRevisions to the issuer limit calculation in this Section will be recommended by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and approved by the ERCOT Board.  ERCOT shall update parameter values on the first day of the month following ERCOT Board approval unless otherwise directed by the ERCOT Board.  ERCOT shall provide a Market Notice prior to implementation of a revised parameter value.\n(b)\tThe Counter-Party may give a surety bond naming ERCOT as the beneficiary.  \n(i)\tThe surety bond must be signed by a surety acceptable to ERCOT, in its sole discretion and must be in the form of ERCOT\u2019s standard surety bond form approved by the ERCOT Board.  No modifications to the form are permitted.\n(ii)\tThe surety bond must be issued by an insurance company with a minimum rating of A- with S&P and Fitch and A3 with Moody\u2019s, if available.  No surety bonds will be accepted from insurance companies, which are rated below A-/A3 by one or more rating agencies.  If there are split ratings amongst rating agencies, ERCOT will use the lowest of different ratings within the same rating agency and amongst different rating agencies.\n(iii)\tSurety bonds are subject to a limit of $10 million per Counter-Party per insurer and an overall limit of $100 million per insurer for all ERCOT Counter-Parties.  This overall limit is aggregated for the entire corporate family in case of multiple insurance companies belonging to the same corporate family.\n(iv)\tThe surety bond must be issued by an insurance company with a minimum financial size category of XII as determined by AM Best.\n(c)\tThe Counter-Party may deposit Cash Collateral with ERCOT with the understanding that ERCOT may draw part or all of the deposited cash to satisfy any overdue payments owed by the Counter-Party to ERCOT.

If  all or part of ACLC and/or ACLD cannot be estimated with current data, then the most recently available values shall be used to determine the Counter-Party\u2019s ACLC and/or ACLD.  ERCOT shall provide electronic Notice, as soon as practicable, to Counter-Parties when utilizing this methodology, and shall further provide electronic Notice to Counter-Parties when current data is restored and available to calculate ACLC and ACLD under paragraphs (a) and (b) above.\nThe above parameters are defined as follows:\nParameter\tUnit\tCurrent Value*\nACLIRF\tPercentage\t10% \u2014 ACL Incremental Risk Factor.\n*  The current value for the parameters referenced in this table above will be recommended by TAC and approved by the ERCOT Board.  ERCOT shall update parameter values on the first day of the month following ERCOT Board approval unless otherwise directed by the ERCOT Board.  ERCOT shall provide a Market Notice prior to implementation of a revised parameter value.\n16.11.4.6.1\tCredit Requirements for CRR Auction Participation\n(1)\tAs a requirement for participation in any CRR Auction, each Counter-Party participating in any CRR Auction, including those as permitted by Sections 16.11.6.1.4, Repossession of CRRs by ERCOT, and 16.11.6.1.5, Declaration of Forfeit of CRRs, shall communicate to ERCOT the credit limit it would like to establish for the CRR Auction prior to the close of the CRR bid submission window. \n(2)\tConsistent with paragraph (4)(c)(ii) of Section 7.5.1, Nature and Timing, ERCOT shall only modify the credit limit date in paragraph (1) above under a condition in which an ERCOT computer system failure causes Counter-Parties to be delayed or unable in submitting their credit limits for the CRR Auction and ERCOT determines that the successful execution of the CRR Auction would be jeopardized without such modification.  In such an event, ERCOT will issue a Market Notice advising of the revised credit limit date and its cause.\n(3)\tERCOT shall assign the ACL locked for CRR Auction for each Counter-Party participating in any CRR Auction as the lower of the Counter-Party\u2019s:\n(a)\tRequested credit limit, as described in paragraph (1) above; \n(b)\tACLC, calculated in accordance with paragraph (1)(a) of Section 16.11.4.6, Determination of Counter-Party Available Credit Limits, at the time of the closure of the CRR bid submission window; or\n(c)\tPre-auction screening credit exposure amount, calculated in accordance with paragraph (2) of Section 7.5.5.3, Auction Process. \n(4)\tERCOT shall impose a credit limit in awarding bids and offers in the CRR Auction as described in Section 7.5.5.3. \n16.11.4.6.2\tCredit Requirements for DAM Participation\n(1)\tERCOT shall impose a credit limit of the ACLD on each Counter-Party participating in the DAM.\n(2)\tERCOT shall impose the credit limit for DAM participation calculated in paragraph (1) above on the Counter-Party\u2019s QSEs and all Subordinate QSEs combined participation in the DAM as described in Section 4.4.10, Credit Requirement for DAM Bids and Offers.\n(3)\tA new credit limit will be sent to each Counter-Party participating in the DAM daily.\n16.11.4.7\tCredit Monitoring and Management Reports\n(1)\tERCOT shall post twice each Business Day on the Market Information System (MIS) Certified Area each active Counter-Party\u2019s credit monitoring and management related reports as listed below.  The first posting shall be made by 1200 and the second posting shall be made as close as reasonably possible to the close of the Business Day but no later than 2350.  The reports listed in items (f) and (g) below are not required to be included in both first and second posting if the Counter-Party has no active CRR ownership. The reports listed in items (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) below are not required to be included in the second post if there are no changes to the underlying data.

To enable ERCOT to monitor creditworthiness, each Counter-Party shall provide to ERCOT:  \n(a)\tIts own or its Ultimate Parent\u2019s quarterly (semi-annually, if the Ultimate Parent is foreign and rated by a rating agency acceptable to ERCOT) unaudited financial statements not later than 60 days (90 days if the Ultimate Parent is foreign and rated by a rating agency acceptable to ERCOT) after the close of each of the issuer\u2019s fiscal quarters; if an issuer\u2019s financial statements are publicly available electronically and the issuer provides to ERCOT sufficient information to access those financial statements, then the issuer is considered to have met this requirement. \n(b)\tIts own or its Ultimate Parent\u2019s annual audited financial statements not later than 120 days after the close of each of the issuer\u2019s fiscal year; if an issuer\u2019s financial statements are publicly available electronically and the issuer provides to ERCOT sufficient information to access those financial statements, then the issuer is considered to have met this requirement.  ERCOT may extend the period for providing interim unaudited or annual audited statements on a case-by-case basis.  Annual audited financial statements must be prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n(c)\tFor paragraphs (a) and (b) above, financial statements shall include the Counter-Party\u2019s or its Ultimate Parent\u2019s:  \n(i)\tStatement of Financial Position (balance sheet) as of the applicable quarterly or annual ending date; \n(ii)\tStatement of Income (or Profit and Loss); and \n(iii)\tStatement of Cash Flows.\n(d)\tNotice of a material change.  A Counter-Party shall inform ERCOT within one Business Day if it has experienced a material change in its operations, financial condition or prospects that might adversely affect the Counter-Party.\n(2)\tA Counter-Party is responsible at all times for maintaining:\n(a)\tFinancial Security in an amount equal to or greater than that Counter-Party\u2019s:\n(i)\tTPES; plus\n(ii)\tNet Positive Exposure of approved CRR Bilateral Trades; plus\n(iii)\tACL locked for CRR Auction, if any; and\n(b)\tRemainder Collateral in an amount equal to or greater than that Counter-Party\u2019s TPEA.\n(3)\tERCOT shall promptly notify each Counter-Party of the need to increase its Financial Security and allow the Counter-Party time, as defined in paragraph (6)(a) below, to provide additional Financial Security to maintain compliance with this Section. \n(4)\tWhen either the Counter-Party\u2019s TPEA or TPES as defined in Section 16.11.4, Determination and Monitoring of Counter-Party Credit Exposure, reaches 90% of its requirement, ERCOT shall use reasonable efforts to electronically issue a warning to the Counter-Party\u2019s Authorized Representative and credit contact advising the Counter-Party that it should consider increasing its Financial Security.  However, failure to issue that warning does not prevent ERCOT from exercising any of its other rights under this Section.\n(5)\tERCOT may suspend a Counter-Party when:\n(a)\tThat Counter-Party\u2019s TPES as defined in Section 16.11.4, equals or exceeds 100% of its Financial Security; or\n(b)\tThat Counter-Party\u2019s TPEA as defined in Section 16.11.4 equals or exceeds 100% of its Remainder Collateral. \nThe Counter-Party is responsible at all times for managing its activity within both its TPEA and its TPES or increasing its Financial Security to avoid reaching its limits.  Any failure by ERCOT to send a Notice as set forth in this Section does not relieve the Counter-Party from the obligation to maintain appropriate Financial Security in amounts equal to or greater than that Counter-Party\u2019s TPES and TPEA as defined in Section 16.11.4. \n(6)\tTo the extent that a Counter-Party fails to maintain Financial Security in amounts equal to or greater than its TPES or Remainder Collateral in amounts equal to or greater than its TPEA, each as defined in Section 16.11.4:\n(a)\tERCOT shall promptly notify the Counter-Party of the amount by which its Financial Security must be increased and allow it: \n(i)\tUntil 1500 on the second Bank Business Day from the date on which ERCOT delivered the Notice to increase its Financial Security if ERCOT delivered its Notice before 1500; or \n(ii)\tUntil 1700 on the second Bank Business Day from the date on which ERCOT delivered Notification to increase its Financial Security if ERCOT delivered its Notice after 1500 but prior to 1700.  \nERCOT shall notify the QSE\u2019s Authorized Representative(s) and Credit Contact if it has not received the required security by 1530 on the Bank Business Day on which the security was due; however, failure to notify the Counter-Party\u2019s representatives or contact that the required security was not received does not prevent ERCOT from exercising any of its other rights under this Section.\n(b)\tAt the same time ERCOT notifies the Counter-Party that is the QSE, ERCOT may notify each LSE and Resource represented by the Counter-Party that the LSE or Resource may be required to designate a new QSE if its current QSE fails to increase its Financial Security. \n(c)\tERCOT is not required to make any payment to that Counter-Party unless and until the Counter-Party increases its Financial Security.  The payments that ERCOT will not make to a Counter-Party include Invoice receipts, CRR revenues, CRR credits, reimbursements for short payments, and any other reimbursements or credits under any other agreement between the Market Participant and ERCOT.  ERCOT may retain all such amounts until the Counter-Party has fully discharged all payment obligations owed to ERCOT under the Counter-Party Agreement, other agreements, and these Protocols. \n(d)\tERCOT may reject any bids or offers in a CRR Auction from the Counter-Party until it has increased its Financial Security.  ERCOT may reject any bids or offers from the Counter-Party in the DAM until it has increased its Financial Security.\n(7)\tIf a Counter-Party increases its Financial Security as required by ERCOT by the deadline in paragraph (6)(a) above, then ERCOT may notify each LSE and Resource represented by the Counter-Party.\n(8)\tIf a Counter-Party increases its Financial Security as required by ERCOT by the deadline in paragraph (6)(a) above, then ERCOT shall release any payments held.\n16.11.6\tPayment Breach and Late Payments by Market Participants\n(1)\tIt is the sole responsibility of each Market Participant to ensure that the full amounts due to ERCOT, or its designee, if applicable, by that Market Participant, are paid to ERCOT by the applicable time and date specified in the Protocols.  If no time is specified in the Protocols for a particular type of payment, then payment must be made by the close of the Bank Business Day on which payment is due. \n(2)\tIf a Market Participant receives separate Invoices for Subordinate QSE or various CRR Account Holder activity, netting by the Market Participant of the amounts due to ERCOT with amounts due to the Market Participant among those Invoices for payment purposes is not permitted.  The amounts due to ERCOT on the separate Invoices for each Market Participant must be paid by the applicable time and date specified in the Protocols.  If a Market Participant does not pay the full amount due to ERCOT for all such Invoices by the required time, ERCOT shall deduct any and all amounts due and unpaid from any amounts due to the same Market Participant before allocating short payments to other Market Participants.\n(3)\tThe failure of a Market Participant to pay when due any payment or Financial Security obligation owed to ERCOT or its designee, if applicable, under any Agreement with ERCOT, is a Late Payment and constitutes an event of Payment Breach.  For purposes of designating a Late Payment, ERCOT shall consider multiple Invoices unpaid when due on a single Business Day by a single Market Participant as constituting one Late Payment.  Any Payment Breach by a Market Participant under any agreement with ERCOT is a Default under all other agreements between ERCOT and the Market Participant unless cured within one Bank Business Day after ERCOT delivers to the Market Participant written notice of the Payment Breach.  \n(4)\tUpon a Payment Breach, ERCOT shall immediately attempt to contact the Market Participant\u2019s Authorized Representative and/or Credit Contact named in the Counter-Party Credit Application telephonically to inform the Market Participant of the Payment Breach, and demand payment of the past due amount. ERCOT shall also provide the Market Participant with written notice of the Payment Breach via email.  Upon a Payment Breach, ERCOT may impose remedies for Payment Breach, as set forth in Section 16.11.6.1, ERCOT\u2019s Remedies, in addition to any other rights or remedies ERCOT has under any agreement, these Protocols or at common law.  \n(5)\tIf a Market Participant makes a payment (or a partial payment, if allowed by these Protocols) or satisfies a collateral call to ERCOT after the required due date and time, or if a short-paid Invoice is settled by a draw on available security greater than the amount of Market Participant\u2019s cash collateral held in excess of that required to cover its TPE (\u201cExcess Collateral\u201d), then that payment will be deemed a \u201cLate Payment.\u201d  \n(6)\tFor purposes of assessing if a payment is a Late Payment, the time of receipt of a payment will be determined as follows:\n(a)\tFor cash payments, the timestamp for when funds are credited to ERCOT\u2019s bank account, or;\n(b)\tFor non-cash Financial Security,\n(i)\tThe timestamp of the email or facsimile, if the required documentation is delivered to ERCOT by email or facsimile, or;\n(ii)\tThe timestamp of the delivery receipt, if the required documentation is mailed or physically delivered to ERCOT. \n(7)\tERCOT may, in its sole discretion, and upon a Market Participant\u2019s showing that the failure to pay when due was not within the control of the Market Participant, deem that a failure to pay when due was neither a Payment Breach nor a Late Payment.  \n(8)\tERCOT shall track the number of Late Payments received from each Market Participant in each rolling 12-month period for purposes of imposing the Late Payment remedies set forth in Section 16.11.6.2, ERCOT\u2019s Remedies for Late Payments by a Market Participant.\n16.11.6.1\tERCOT\u2019s Remedies \n(1)\tIn addition to all other remedies that ERCOT has under any agreement, common law or these Protocols, for Payment Breaches or other Defaults by a Market Participant, ERCOT has the following additional remedies.\n16.11.6.1.1\tNo Payments by ERCOT to Market Participant\n(1)\tERCOT is not required to make any payment to a Market Participant unless and until the Market Participant satisfies the Payment Breach by paying the past due amount in full, including amounts due under Section 16.11.6.1.3, Aggregate Amount Owed by Breaching Market Participant Immediately Due.  The payments that ERCOT will not make include Invoice receipts, CRR Auction revenues, CRR credits, reimbursements for short payments and any other reimbursements or credits under any and all other agreements between ERCOT and the Market Participant.  ERCOT shall retain all such amounts, and may apply all withheld funds toward the payment of the delinquent amount(s), until the Market Participant has fully paid all amounts owed to ERCOT under any agreements and these Protocols.  If the Market Participant should fail to pay the full amount due within the cure period, ERCOT may apply all funds it withheld toward the payment of the delinquent amount(s).\n16.11.6.1.2\tERCOT May Draw On, Hold or Distribute Funds\n(1)\tUpon a Payment Breach, ERCOT, at its option, without notice to the Market Participant and in its sole discretion, may immediately, or at any time before the Market Participant pays the past due amount in full, including amounts due under Section 16.11.6.1.3, Aggregate Amount Owed by Breaching Market Participant Immediately Due, draw on, hold or distribute to other Market Participants any Financial Security or other funds of the Market Participant in ERCOT\u2019s possession.  If the funds drawn exceed the amount applied to any Payment Breach, then ERCOT may hold those funds as Financial Security.\n16.11.6.1.3\tAggregate Amount Owed by Breaching Market Participant Immediately Due\n(1)\tERCOT shall aggregate all amounts due it by the Market Participant under any agreement with ERCOT and these Protocols into a single amount to the fullest extent allowed by law.  The entire unpaid net balance owed to ERCOT by the Market Participant, at ERCOT\u2019s option, and its sole discretion, is immediately due and payable without further notice and demand for payment.  Any such notice and demand for payment are expressly waived by the Market Participant.\n16.11.6.1.4\tRepossession of CRRs by ERCOT\n(1)\tERCOT, at its sole discretion, may repossess CRRs held by a Market Participant with a Payment Breach or other Default.  ERCOT shall effect that repossession by sending a written notice to the Market Participant of the repossession and by removing the CRRs from the Market Participant\u2019s CRR account.  CRRs that settle in the same calendar month as the repossession but subsequent to the effective date of the repossession shall be voided.  The Market Participant will neither be charged, nor entitled to credit, for the voided CRRs in the DAM Settlement.  ERCOT shall offer a portfolio of CRRs containing all of the remaining unvoided repossessed CRRs, with each repossessed CRR in its existing configuration, in a one-time auction to Market Participants (other than the Market Participant(s) in Payment Breach or other Default) for sale to the highest bidder with a positive bid price for the entire portfolio.  PTP Options with Refund and PTP Obligations with Refund will be voided and will not be included in the portfolio of repossessed CRRs available in the one-time auction.  ERCOT shall offset net revenues from that sale against amounts owed to ERCOT by the Market Participant.  If revenues from the sale exceed amounts owed to ERCOT then the excess shall be remitted to the Market Participant.  If ERCOT receives no positive bids for the portfolio of CRRs in the one-time auction, ERCOT shall void all of the repossessed CRRs.\n[NPRR1023:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation:] \n(1)\tERCOT, at its sole discretion, may repossess CRRs held by a Market Participant in Default under an Agreement with ERCOT.  ERCOT shall effect that repossession by sending a written notice to the Market Participant of the repossession and by removing the Market Participant\u2019s access to the repossessed CRRs.  The repossessed CRRs will be handled as specified in Section 16.11.6.1.6, Liquidation of Repossessed or Forfeited CRRs.\n16.11.6.1.5\tDeclaration of Forfeit of CRRs\n(1)\tAt ERCOT\u2019s sole discretion, if it does not receive full payment on the due date of a CRR Auction Invoice, may declare any of the CRR bids cleared and Pre-Assigned Congestion Revenue Rights (PCRRs) allocated to the Market Participant forfeited. ERCOT shall effect that forfeiture by sending a written notice to the Market Participant of the forfeiture and of not delivering the CRRs or PCRRs to the Market Participant\u2019s CRR account.  ERCOT shall either (a) offer all forfeited CRRs, with each forfeited CRR in its existing configuration, in a one-time auction to Market Participants (other than the Market Participant(s) in Payment Breach or other Default) for sale to the highest bidder with a positive bid price or (b) ERCOT shall make the related capacity available in subsequent CRR Auctions.  Revenue from that sale shall be considered as CRR Auction revenue and distributed to QSEs based on Load Ratio Share as specified in Section 7.5.7, Method for Distributing CRR Auction Revenues.\n[NPRR1023:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation:] \n(1)\tAt ERCOT\u2019s sole discretion, if it does not receive full payment on the due date of a CRR Auction Invoice, it may declare any of the CRR bids cleared and Pre-Assigned Congestion Revenue Rights (PCRRs) allocated to the Market Participant forfeited. ERCOT shall effect that forfeiture by sending a written Notice to the Market Participant of the forfeiture and by not delivering the CRRs or PCRRs to the Market Participant\u2019s CRR account.  The forfeited CRRs or PCRRs will be liquidated as specified in Section 16.11.6.1.6, Liquidation of Repossessed or Forfeited CRRs.\n(2)\tERCOT may also, at its sole discretion, honor any of the offers from Market Participants that were cleared in the CRR Auction by removing the CRRs from the Market Participant\u2019s CRR account.  ERCOT shall offset net revenues due to the Market Participant from CRRs offered and cleared against amounts owed to ERCOT by the Market Participant.\n[NPRR1023:  Replace paragraph (2) above with the following upon system implementation:] \n(2)\tERCOT may also, at its sole discretion, honor any of the sell offers that were cleared in the CRR Auction made by a Market Participant who fails to fully pay the CRR Auction Invoice when due.

If this is insufficient to pay the charge in full, the remainder due will be short-paid for the Operating Day in accordance with Section 9.7.3, Enforcing the Financial Security of a Short-Paying Invoice Recipient.  Regardless of the short pay, any Market Participant from whom CRRs were repossessed or forfeited shall remain liable for any charges associated with the liquidation of its CRRs in accordance with paragraph (4) of Section 16.11.6.1.7, Revocation of a Market Participant\u2019s Rights and Termination of Agreements.\n(ii)\tIf the CRR portfolio results in a net payment in the DAM, the payment amount will be added to the cash collateral held by ERCOT for the Market Participant from whom the CRRs were repossessed or forfeited. \n(b) \tFor any remaining unvoided repossessed or forfeited CRRs for one-month or multi-month strips, ERCOT will offer each CRR into the next available auction for the effective time period of the repossessed or forfeited CRR.   \n(i)\tCRRs will be offered into auctions at -$0.01 for PTP Options and -$500.00 for PTP Obligations.\n(ii)\tIf a CRR is offered into an auction but is not fully awarded, the remaining MW of the CRR will be offered into the next available auction for the effective time period of the repossessed or forfeited CRR.  ERCOT may adjust the offer price for a PTP Obligation in subsequent auctions to increase the likelihood of the sell offer being fully awarded.\nIf another auction will not be held for the effective time period of the repossessed or forfeited CRRs, the remaining unawarded MW of each CRR will settle in the DAM and may result in net payments or charges accruing for Operating Days throughout the month, as noted in paragraph (2)(a) above. \n(iii)\tPrior to offering repossessed or forfeited CRRs into an auction, ERCOT will calculate the value of all PTP Obligations for each CRR Account Holder associated with the defaulting Counter-Party by summing the value of all existing PTP Obligations for which the most recent auction clearing price for the effective time period of the auction was negative.  The value of each CRR will be calculated per the following formula: (MW amount) x (TOU hours) x (auction clearing price).  The total value of the PTP Obligations for the defaulting Counter-Party will be evaluated to determine if it exceeds 10% of the value of all existing PTP Obligations for which the most recent auction clearing prices for the effective time period of the auction were negative.  If the total value of the PTP Obligations for the defaulting Counter-Party to be offered into an auction exceeds the 10% threshold, ERCOT will prorate the CRR MW amounts to be offered into the auction to reduce the total portfolio value to be below the 10% threshold.  The remaining CRR MW will be offered into the next available auction for the effective time period of the repossessed or forfeited CRRs or will settle in DAM if there will not be another auction for the effective time period.  \n(iv)\tA charge resulting from the sale of the CRRs into an auction will, to the extent possible, be paid by drawing on any available Financial Security of the Market Participant from whom the CRRs were repossessed or forfeited.  If this is insufficient to pay the charge in full, the remainder due will be short-paid in accordance with Section 9.7.3.  Regardless of the short pay, any Market Participant from whom CRRs were repossessed or forfeited shall remain liable for any charges associated with the liquidation of its CRRs in accordance with paragraph (4) of Section 16.11.6.1.7.\n(v)\tA payment resulting from the sale of the CRRs into an auction will be added to the Financial Security of the Market Participant from whom the CRRs were repossessed or forfeited. \n16.11.6.1.6\tRevocation of a Market Participant\u2019s Rights and Termination of Agreements\n(1)\tERCOT may revoke a breaching Market Participant\u2019s rights to conduct activities under these Protocols.  ERCOT may also terminate the breaching Market Participant\u2019s agreements with ERCOT.\n(2)\tIf ERCOT revokes a Market Participant\u2019s rights or terminates the Market Participant\u2019s agreements, then the provisions of Section 16.2.5, Suspended or Terminated Qualified Scheduling Entity \u2013 Notification to LSEs and Resource Entities Represented, and Section 16.2.6.1, Designation as an Emergency Qualified Scheduling Entity or Virtual Qualified Scheduling Entity, apply.\n(3)\tIf a breaching Market Participant is also an LSE (whether or not the Default occurred pursuant to the Market Participant\u2019s activities as an LSE), then:\n(a) \tWithin 24 hours of receiving notice of the Payment Breach, the Market Participant shall provide to ERCOT all the information regarding its ESI IDs set forth in the ERCOT Retail Market Guide; and \n(b)\tOn revocation of some or all of the Market Participant\u2019s rights or termination of the Market Participant\u2019s agreements and on notice to the Market Participant and the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), ERCOT shall initiate a Mass Transition of the Market Participant\u2019s ESI IDs pursuant to Section 15.1.3.1, Mass Transition Process, without the necessity of obtaining any order from or other action by the PUCT.  \n(4)\tAfter revocation of its rights or termination of its Agreement with ERCOT, the Market Participant will remain liable for all charges or costs associated with any continued activity related to the Counter-Party\u2019s relationship with ERCOT and any expenses arising from the consequences of such termination or revocation.\n16.11.6.2\tERCOT\u2019s Remedies for Late Payments by a Market Participant\n(1)\tIf a Market Participant makes any Late Payments, and even if ERCOT does not immediately implement the above-referenced remedies for any Payment Breach by a Market Participant, the Market Participant is subject to the actions enumerated in this Section.\n(2)\tThis Section does not waive ERCOT\u2019s right to impose remedies for Payment Breach, as set forth in Section 16.11.6.1, ERCOT\u2019s Remedies, in addition to any other rights or remedies ERCOT has under any agreement, these Protocols, or at common law, for any Payment Breach by the Market Participant in each rolling 12-month period for purposes of imposing the Late Payment remedies set forth in this Section.\n16.11.6.2.1\tFirst Late Payment in Any Rolling 12-Month Period\n(1)\tFor the first Late Payment in any rolling 12-month period, ERCOT shall take Level I Enforcement action, as described in Section 16.11.6.2.5, Level I Enforcement.\n(2)\tERCOT shall send written notice to the Market Participant\u2019s Authorized Representative and/or Credit Contact via email, advising the Market Participant of the action required under Level I Enforcement.\n16.11.6.2.2\tSecond Late Payment in Any Rolling 12-Month Period\n(1)\tFor the second Late Payment in any rolling 12-month period, ERCOT shall take Level II Enforcement action, as described in Section 16.11.6.2.6, Level II Enforcement.:\n(2)\tERCOT shall send written notice to the Market Participant\u2019s Authorized Representative and/or Credit Contact via email, advising the Market Participant of the action required under Level II Enforcement.\n16.11.6.2.3\tThird Late Payment in Any Rolling 12-Month Period\n(1)\tFor the third Late Payment in any rolling 12-month period, ERCOT shall take Level III Enforcement action, as described in Section 16.11.6.2.7, Level III Enforcement.\n(2)\tERCOT shall send written notice to the Market Participant\u2019s Authorized Representative and/or Credit Contact via email, advising the Market Participant of the action required under Level III Enforcement, and informing the Market Participant that a fourth Late Payment in any rolling 12-month period shall result in ERCOT taking action under Section 16.11.6.1.6, Revocation of a Market Participant\u2019s Rights and Termination of Agreements.  \n16.11.6.2.4\tFourth Late Payment in Any Rolling 12-Month Period\n(1)\tFor the fourth Late Payment resulting from a Payment Breach in any rolling 12-month period, ERCOT shall take action under Section 16.11.6.1.6, Revocation of a Market Participant\u2019s Rights and Termination of Agreements.\n16.11.6.2.5\tLevel I Enforcement\n(1)\tUnder Level I Enforcement, ERCOT shall notify the Market Participant to comply with one of the following requirements:\n(a)\tIf the Market Participant has not provided Financial Security, the Market Participant shall now provide Financial Security, within two Bank Business Days, in an amount at or above 110% of the amount of the Market Participant\u2019s TPE;

Digital Certificates expire after one year.\n(2)\tA User Security Administrator (USA) is responsible for managing the Market Participant\u2019s access to non-public ERCOT computer systems through Digital Certificates.  A USA may also be responsible for managing the Market Participant\u2019s access to the online Resource Integration and Ongoing Operations (\u201cRIOO\u201d) system, which does not require a Digital Certificate.  Each Market Participant that will receive Digital Certificate(s) must, as part of the application for registration with ERCOT, designate an individual employee or authorized agent as its USA, and optionally, a backup USA.  If a Market Participant has designated a backup USA and the primary USA fails to perform, or is unable to perform, the functions required of a USA, then the backup USA shall perform any and all functions required of the primary USA.  The Market Participant is responsible for revising its USA list as the need arises.  The Market Participant\u2019s USA is responsible for registering all Market Participant\u2019s Digital Certificate holders (\u201cCertificate Holders\u201d) and administering the use of Digital Certificates on behalf of the Market Participant.  ERCOT Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (ECEII) posted on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure or Certified Area may be accessed only by those individuals that are issued ECEII-eligible Digital Certificates.  Each Market Participant that will receive Digital Certificates and  having more than one ERCOT functional registration must designate a USA for each registration (which may be the same employee or authorized agent) and shall manage each registration separately for the purposes of this Section.  Once the Market Participant completes registration requirements, ERCOT shall send the USA a copy of the Digital Certificate user guide. \n(3)\tOnly Market Participants registered with ERCOT as either a Municipally Owned Utility (MOU) or an Electric Cooperative (EC), and as a Distribution Service Provider (DSP) and/or Load Serving Entity (LSE), may be eligible to opt out of designating a USA and receiving Digital Certificates if the Market Participant demonstrates to ERCOT\u2019s satisfaction that it does not need a Digital Certificate to perform its obligations under the ERCOT Protocols, market guides, or other applicable rules. \n(4) \tAn eligible Market Participant that wishes to opt out of designating a USA and receiving Digital Certificates shall submit a request form, found on the ERCOT website, confirming its desire to opt out subject to ERCOT\u2019s review and approval.  ERCOT will notify the requesting Market Participant of its approval or disapproval of the request within 14 Business Days.  ERCOT may subsequently revoke, at its sole discretion, Market Participant\u2019s election to opt out if the Market Participant\u2019s lack of a Digital Certificate causes administrative burdens or reliability concerns.  ERCOT will send notice of revocation to the Market Participant who will have ten Business Days to fill out a Notice of Change of Information (NCI) form (Section 23, Form E, Notice of Change of Information) and submit it to ERCOT.  Once the NCI is submitted, the request for a Digital Certificate will be subject to the same requirements applicable to the processing of an initial request by a new Market Participant. \n(5)\tMarket Participants that have received approval from ERCOT to opt out of designating a USA and receiving Digital Certificates are not excused from obligations under the ERCOT Protocols, other than the obligations required in this Section 16.12 regarding Digital Certificates.  Market Participants who opt out shall still be required to submit the Digital Certificate Audit Attestation (DCAA) required by paragraph (2) of Section 16.12.3, Market Participant Audits of User Security Administrators and Digital Certificates, for the portion of the year, if any, during which they had a USA and Digital Certificate(s).\n(6)\tA Market Participant that has been granted approval by ERCOT to opt out of designating a USA and receiving Digital Certificates will not have access to information that would ordinarily be retrievable with a Digital Certificate.  A Market Participant that has been granted approval by ERCOT to opt out of designating a USA and receiving Digital Certificates may, at any time, cancel its opt-out status by submitting an NCI form (Section 23, Form E).\n16.12.1\tUSA Responsibilities and Qualifications for Digital Certificate Holders\n(1)\tThe USA and the Market Participant are responsible for the following:\n(a)\tRequesting Digital Certificates for authorized Certificate Holders (either persons or programmatic interfaces) that the USA has qualified through an appropriate screening process requiring confirmation that the Certificate Holder is an employee or authorized agent (including third parties) of the Market Participant.  A Certificate Holder (including the USA) must be qualified as set forth below.  The Market Participant shall be liable for ensuring that each of its Certificate Holder(s) meets the requirements of (i) \u2013 (v) below.\n(i)\tFor any employee or authorized agent receiving a Digital Certificate, the Market Participant shall confirm that the employee or authorized agent satisfies reasonable background review sufficient for employment or contract with the Market Participant so as to reasonably limit threat(s) to ERCOT\u2019s market or computer systems.  The Market Participant may not request that Digital Certificates be issued to any employee or authorized agent that it determines, after reasonable background review, poses a threat to ERCOT\u2019s market or computer systems.  \n(ii)\tThe Certificate Holder is aware of the rules and restrictions relating to the use of Digital Certificates.  \n(iii)\tThe Certificate Holder is eligible to review and receive technology and software under applicable export control laws and regulations.  ERCOT shall post links to such laws and regulations on the ERCOT website. \n(iv)\tThe Market Participant has conducted a reasonable review of the Certificate Holder and has confirmed that the Certificate Holder is not on any U.S. terrorist threat lists such as the Consolidated Screening List or the Federal Bureau of Investigation Most Wanted Terrorists List.  ERCOT will post links to relevant lists on the ERCOT website.  \n(v)\tThe Certificate Holder does not violate the conditions of use specified by the software vendor that provides the Digital Certificates for the Market Participant\u2019s use and provided to the Certificate Holder.  ERCOT will post links to relevant conditions of use on the ERCOT website.\n(b)\tRequesting revocation of Digital Certificates.  The Market Participant or USA shall request revocation of Digital Certificates by proceeding with the ERCOT Digital Certificate revocation process as described in the Digital Certificate User Guide.  The Market Participant or USA shall request revocation of a Digital Certificate under any of the following conditions:\n(i)\tAs soon as possible but no later than three Business Days after:\n(A)\tA Certificate Holder ceases employment with the Market Participant; or\n(B)\tThe Market Participant becomes aware that a Certificate Holder is changing job functions (pursuant to a reasonable process for identifying when job function changes occur) so that the Certificate Holder no longer needs the Digital Certificate; \n(ii)\tAs soon as possible, but no later than five Business Days, after the Market Participant becomes aware (pursuant to a reasonable process for identifying violations) that the Certificate Holder has violated any of the following conditions of use of a Digital Certificate: \n(A)\tViolating the requirements if any of paragraph (1)(a)(i) \u2013 (v) above;\n(B)\tUsing the Digital Certificate for any unauthorized purpose; or \n(C)\tAllowing any person other than the Certificate Holder to use the Digital Certificate. \n(c)\tManaging the level of access for each Certificate Holder by assigning and maintaining Digital Certificate roles for each authorized user in accordance with the process set forth in ERCOT\u2019s Digital Certificate user guide.\n(d)\tRequesting annual renewal of Digital Certificates.\t\n(e)\tIf needed, issuing Digital Certificates for use by electronic systems not limited to servers. \n\tMaintaining the integrity of the administration of Digital Certificates through consistent, sound and reasonable business practices. \n16.12.2\tRequirements for Use of Digital Certificates\n(1)\tUse of Digital Certificates must comply with the following:\n(a)\tA Digital Certificate shall be used by only one individual and may not be shared.

Multiple Digital Certificates may be installed and managed on a single computer.  ERCOT shall include instructions on how to manage multiple Digital Certificates in the Digital Certificate user guide.\n(b)\tA Digital Certificate may not be traded or sold.\n(c)\tElectronic equipment on which the Digital Certificate resides must be physically and electronically secured in a reasonable manner to prevent improper use of the Digital Certificate.\n(d)\tThe Market Participant is wholly responsible for any use of Digital Certificates issued by its USA.\n16.12.3\tMarket Participant Audits of User Security Administrators and Digital Certificates\n(1)\tDuring September of each year, each Market Participant that has been issued any Digital Certificates shall generate a list of its registered USA and Certificate Holders.  The Market Participant, through its USA or another authorized third party, shall perform an audit by reviewing the list and noting any inconsistencies or instances of non-compliance (including, for example, any Certificate Holder that may have changed job functions and no longer requires the Digital Certificate).  If the Market Participant or its USA or the authorized third party identifies discrepancies, the USA shall use the process for managing Digital Certificates as included in ERCOT\u2019s Digital Certificate user guide to rectify the discrepancy. The audit must, at a minimum confirm that:\n(a)\tThe Market Participant and each listed USA and Certificate Holder meet the applicable requirements of paragraph (1)(a) of Section 16.12.1, USA Responsibilities and Qualifications for Digital Certificate Holders, and are not subject to any of the conditions that would require revocation as described in paragraph (1)(b) of Section 16.12.1;  \n(b)\tEach listed USA and Certificate Holder is currently employed by or is an authorized agent contracted with the Market Participant; \n(c)\tThe Market Participant has verified that the listed USA is authorized to be the USA; \n(d)\tEach Certificate Holder is authorized to retain and use the Digital Certificate; and\n(e)\tEach listed Certificate Holder needs the Digital Certificate to perform his or her job functions.\n(2)\tBy October 1 of each year, a Market Participant shall submit to ERCOT a DCAA (as provided for in Section 23, Form L, Digital Certificate Audit Attestation) from an individual who: (a) is an officer, executive, or employee of the Market Participant or of an Affiliate of the Market Participant; and (b) has authority to bind the Market Participant.  The attestation shall certify that: \n(a)\tThe Market Participant has complied with the requirements of the audit;\n(b)\tThe Market Participant has verified that all assigned Digital Certificates belong to Certificate Holders authorized by the Market Participant\u2019s USA.  If the Certificate Holders no longer meet the criteria in paragraph (1)(a) of Section 16.12.1, the USA shall inform ERCOT as described in paragraph (1)(b) of Section 16.12.1 and note the findings in the response; and\n(c)\tThe USA and all Certificate Holders have been qualified through a reasonable screening process and background review required by paragraphs (1)(a)(i)-(v) of Section 16.12.1. \n(3)\tIf a Market Participant cannot comply with the October 1 deadline at the time this Section first applies to the Market Participant, the Market Participant shall request an extension of the deadline by providing ERCOT a written explanation of why it cannot meet the deadline.  The explanation must include a plan and timeline for compliance not to exceed six months from the original deadline.  ERCOT shall review that extension request and notify the Market Participant if the request is approved or denied.  ERCOT may approve no more than one extension request per Market Participant.  \n(4)\tBy December 1 of each year, ERCOT shall acknowledge receipt of each DCAA audit received and indicate whether any required information is missing from the DCAA.\n16.12.4\tERCOT Audit - Consequences of Non-compliance\n(1)\tERCOT, or its designee, shall review the DCAA submitted under Section 16.12.3, Market Participant Audits of User Security Administrators and Digital Certificates, and may audit the Market Participant for compliance with the provisions of this Section 16.12, User Security Administrator and Digital Certificates. The Market Participant shall cooperate fully with ERCOT in such audits.  \n(2)\tOn or about December 15 of each year, ERCOT shall report to the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) all Market Participants failing to properly perform and/or submit complete DCAA(s) as described in Section 16.12.3 or non-compliance with Section 16.12.3.  \n(3)\tERCOT, after providing notice to the Market Participant and PUCT Staff, may disqualify the Market Participant\u2019s USA and/or revoke any or all Digital Certificates assigned to the Market Participant if:\n(a)\tThe Market Participant does not properly and timely perform the audit; \n(b)\tERCOT discovers non-compliance; or \n(c)\tThe Market Participant does not timely request revocation of its Digital Certificates for unauthorized Certificate Holders. \n(4)\tERCOT\u2019s decision to disqualify a Market Participant\u2019s USA or revoke a Market Participant\u2019s Digital Certificates as described above is subject to the following:\n(a) \tA Market Participant\u2019s Digital Certificates may not be revoked unless the Market Participant is given a reasonable opportunity to work with ERCOT to resolve the reason for revocation;\n(b) \tA Market Participant\u2019s USA may not be disqualified unless it is given a reasonable opportunity to authorize a new USA and assign new Digital Certificates as necessary to prevent disruption of the Market Participant\u2019s business; and\n(c) \tA Market Participant may dispute ERCOT\u2019s decision to disqualify the Market Participant\u2019s USA and/or revoke its Digital Certificates through the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Procedure in accordance with Section 20, Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedure, and may appeal the result of the ADR process to the PUCT as provided in Section 20. \n16.13\tRegistration of Emergency Response Service Resources\n(1)\tAn Emergency Response Service (ERS) Resource shall be deemed to have registered with ERCOT when its duly authorized Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) submits an offer on behalf of the Resource in accordance with Section 3.14.3.1, Emergency Response Service Procurement.\n16.14\tTermination of Access Privileges to Restricted Computer Systems and Control Systems\n(1)\tAll Market Participants and ERCOT are required to have processes in place to terminate access privileges, as soon as practicable, to Restricted Systems for any employee, consultant, or contractor, upon termination of employment or where access is no longer required. \n(2)\t\u201cRestricted Systems\u201d include computer or control systems that are essential to the operation of Restricted Facilities.  \n(3)\t\u201cRestricted Facilities\u201d include Facilities and assets that support the reliable operation of the bulk ERCOT System (100 kV and above), such as but not limited to:\n(a)\tGeneration Resources;

ERCOT may determine, in its sole discretion, whether the Entity\u2019s purpose qualifies for registration.\n(3)\tContinued status as an IMRE is contingent upon compliance with all applicable requirements in these Protocols.  ERCOT may suspend an IMRE\u2019s rights as a Market Participant when ERCOT reasonably determines that it is an appropriate remedy for the Entity\u2019s failure to satisfy any applicable requirement.\n16.16\tAdditional Counter-Party Qualification Requirements \n16.16.1\tCounter-Party Criteria\n(1)\tIn order to participate in the ERCOT Real-Time, Day-Ahead and Congestion Revenue Right (CRR) markets, in addition to satisfying any other eligibility requirements set forth in the ERCOT Protocols, each Counter-Party must satisfy, and at all times remain in compliance with, the following requirements: \n(a)\tExpertise in Markets.

ERCOT may extend the period for providing the certificate on a case-by-case basis.\n(3)\tFor new entry Counter-Parties, the certificate must be received by ERCOT prior to participation in any ERCOT markets.\n(4)\tA Counter-Party shall notify ERCOT within one day if it has experienced a material adverse change that would make its most recent annual certificate inaccurate. \n16.16.3\tVerification of Risk Management Framework \n(1)\tERCOT will periodically perform or cause to be performed procedures to assess the risk management framework of Counter-Parties, including its implementation.  \n(2)\tERCOT may retain a third party either to assess the sufficiency of the Counter-Party\u2019s risk management framework or to provide guidance and advice as to what constitutes appropriate content with respect to generally accepted risk management practices in their respective markets, commensurate and proportional in sophistication, scope and frequency to the volume of transactions and the nature and extent of risk taken by the Counter-Party.  \n(3)\tERCOT shall, identify the nature and scope of generally accepted risk management practices in their respective markets by which Counter-Party risk management frameworks will be assessed.  Key elements will include:\n(a)\tThe risk management framework is documented in a risk policy addressing market and credit risks that has been approved by a Counter-Party\u2019s risk management function which includes appropriate corporate persons or bodies that are independent of the Counter-Party\u2019s trading functions, such as a risk management committee, a designated risk officer, participant Counter-Party\u2019s board or board committee, or, if applicable, a board or committee of the Counter-Party\u2019s parent company.\n(b)\tA Counter-Party maintains an organizational structure with clearly defined roles and responsibilities that clearly segregate trading and risk control functions. \n(c)\tThere is clarity of authority specifying the transactions into which traders are allowed to enter.\n(d)\tA Counter-Party ensures that traders have adequate training and/or experience relative to their delegations of authority in systems and the markets in which they transact.\n(e)\tAs appropriate, a Counter-Party has risk limits in place to control risk exposures.\n(f)\tA Counter-Party has reporting in place to ensure risks are adequately communicated throughout the organization.\n(g)\tA Counter-Party has processes in place for independent confirmation of executed transactions.\n(h)\tA Counter-Party performs a periodic valuation or mark-to-market of risk positions, as appropriate.\n(4)\tThe ERCOT Board may approve minimum standards under an Other Binding Document. \n(5)\tUpon notice of being selected for verification, a Counter-Party will make available or submit to ERCOT, or a third party acting on ERCOT\u2019s behalf, such documentation as is necessary to provide evidence of the sufficiency and implementation of its risk management framework.  Such information may include, but not be limited to, documents of the following nature:  risk policies, organizational charts, Delegations of Authority, training records, risk limit structure, reporting frameworks, and relevant procedures, all in a level of detail acceptable to ERCOT.  Along with such documentation, a Counter-Party will provide a written explanation to ERCOT or its agent of how its risk management framework conforms to the risk management standards noted above.  Requested information and documents must be made available for review by ERCOT, or a third party acting on ERCOT\u2019s behalf, 30 days after Notice of the request.  ERCOT will provide Counter-Party Notice of inadequate documentation and will give Counter-Party ten Business Days to correct the inadequacy.  At ERCOT\u2019s sole discretion, these deadlines may be extended on a case-by-case basis.\n(6)\tIf necessary, Counter-Parties will support the verification process by, among other things, making appropriate personnel available for interviews, permitting on-site observation of credit and risk management processes and procedures, and providing written responses to written inquiries on a timely basis.  A Counter-Party may request that ERCOT or a third party performing verification on ERCOT\u2019s behalf perform the review on-site at the Counter-Party\u2019s location.  Any resulting additional expenses will in this case be the sole responsibility of the Counter-Party making the request.   \n(7)\tERCOT will perform procedures to verify the risk management framework at least annually for any Counter-Party if that Counter-Party or its parent:\n(a)\tHas had one or more late payments or represents a Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) or CRR Account Holder that has short-paid Settlement Invoices in the year preceding the date of the annual certificate; and\n(b)\tHas had exposure in CRR Obligations in the ERCOT CRR market during the year preceding the date of the annual certificate. \n(i)\tNotwithstanding the above, ERCOT will perform risk management framework verification procedures on other Counter-Parties at its sole discretion. \n(8)\tUpon completion of its review, ERCOT will notify the Counter-Party whether or not any material deficiencies were noted.  If material deficiencies exist, ERCOT may, in its sole discretion, establish in consultation with the Counter-Party, a remediation plan for any deficiencies.  The remediation period allowed for specific deficiencies should be consistent with the severity of those deficiencies and may have incremental deadlines.  The total remediation period will not exceed 90 days, unless extended, at ERCOT\u2019s sole discretion, on a case-by-case basis.    \n(9)\tRisk management deficiencies remaining beyond the ERCOT-defined remediation periods constitute a material breach under the Counter-Party\u2019s Standard Form Market Participant Agreement as provided for in Section 22, Attachment A, Standard Form Market Participant Agreement.  Upon a material breach, ERCOT may, in addition to any other rights or remedies ERCOT has under any agreement, these Protocols or at common law, suspend any or all future activities in the ERCOT market, pending remediation of deficiencies.  An action by ERCOT to suspend activities in the ERCOT market is subject to the provisions of Section 20, Alternative Dispute Resolution Process.  \n(10)\tParticipation in ERCOT markets is contingent on verification by ERCOT, or by a third party acting on ERCOT\u2019s behalf, that the proposed measures have been implemented.  \n(11)\tIf a Counter-Party provides evidence that its risk management framework has been deemed sufficient for transacting in another Regional Transmission Operator/Independent System Operator market in the United States, ERCOT may elect to forego verification processes.\n(12)\tIn conjunction with providing its annual certificate, if a Counter-Party certifies that there has been no material change in its risk management capabilities since the framework was last verified, ERCOT may elect to forego verification.  ERCOT may not forego verification more than once in any 24-month period.\n16.17\tExemption for Qualified Scheduling Entities Participating Only in Emergency Response Service\n(1)\tA Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) that is not also registered as a Congestion Revenue Rights (CRR) Account Holder, that does not participate in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) or Real-Time Market (RTM), that represents only Emergency Response Service (ERS) Resources, and whose Total Potential Exposure (TPE) (as calculated in Section 16.11.4.1, Determination of Total Potential Exposure for a Counter-Party) is zero may request designation as an ERS-only QSE.  \n(2)\tA QSE must submit a written request for designation as an ERS-only QSE at least five Business Days before the desired effective date of the designation.  \n(3)\tUpon determining that the QSE has addressed all financial risk to ERCOT\u2019s satisfaction, ERCOT shall designate the QSE as an ERS-only QSE, and shall notify the QSE of that designation in writing.\n(4)\tExcept as provided in paragraph (5) below, an ERS-only QSE is exempt from the following requirements: \n(a)\tThe requirement to maintain sufficient collateral under Sections 16.11.1, ERCOT Creditworthiness Requirements for Counter-Parties, and 16.11.5, Monitoring of a Counter-Party\u2019s Creditworthiness and Credit Exposure by ERCOT;\n(b)\tThe requirement to submit financial statements and any notice of material changes under paragraph (1) of Section 16.11.5; and\n(c)\tAll requirements under Section 16.16, Additional Counter-Party Qualification Requirements.\n(5)\tIf ERCOT posts an RTM True-Up Statement or RTM Resettlement Statement providing for a resettlement of any ERS Time Period, and as a result of that resettlement alone, ERCOT determines that an ERS-only QSE has a positive TPE as calculated in Section 16.11.4.1, ERCOT will require that QSE to comply with Section 16.11.5, excluding paragraph (1), until its TPE again equals zero.  If the QSE fails to pay when due any payment or Financial Security obligation owed to ERCOT, ERCOT may terminate the QSE\u2019s ERS-only status.\n(6)\tERCOT shall ensure that its systems prevent participation by ERS-only QSEs in the DAM and RTM.\n(7)\tA QSE must request termination of its ERS-only status in writing.  Termination of ERS-only status will be effective only upon ERCOT\u2019s written confirmation that the QSE has satisfied all creditworthiness requirements applicable to QSEs.\n(8)\tNothing in this Section affects an ERS-only QSE\u2019s obligation under paragraph (6) of Section 16.2.1, Criteria for Qualification as a Qualified Scheduling Entity, to provide ERCOT notice of any material change that could adversely affect the reliability or safety of the ERCOT System.  Additionally, ERCOT may at any time require any ERS-only QSE to demonstrate that its risk management policies and practices are sufficient to ensure that it will be capable of meeting its ERS performance requirements during any ERS Standard Contract Term for which it has submitted an offer or for which it is committed to provide ERS.\n[NPRR857:  Insert Section 16.18 below upon system implementation and satisfying the following conditions:  (1) Southern Cross provides ERCOT with funds to cover the entire estimated cost of the project; and (2) Southern Cross has signed an interconnection agreement with a TSP and the TSP gives ERCOT written notice that Southern Cross has provided it with:  (a) Notice to proceed with the construction of the interconnection; and (b) The financial security required to fund the interconnection facilities; and renumber accordingly:] \n16.18\tRegistration of a Direct Current Tie Operator\n(1)\tEach Entity that operates a Direct Current Tie (DC Tie) shall register as a Direct Current Tie Operator (DCTO) with ERCOT.  To register as a DCTO, an Entity must execute a Standard Form Market Participant Agreement (using the form provided in Section 22, Attachment A, Standard Form Market Participant Agreement), designate a DCTO Authorized Representative and contacts, confirm that it is either registered with ERCOT as a Transmission Service Provider (TSP) that is subject to a Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT)-approved code of conduct or is subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-approved standards of conduct, and be capable of performing the functions of a DCTO, as applicable, as described in these Protocols.\n16.18\tCybersecurity Incident Notification\n(1)\tEach Market Participant shall designate and maintain a Cybersecurity Contact for communications with ERCOT with respect to Cybersecurity Incidents.  Registered Market Participants shall use the Notice of Change of Information form, as provided for in Section 23, Form E, Notice of Change of Information, to designate a Cybersecurity Contact, and maintain updated Cybersecurity Contact information.\n(2)\tAs soon as practicable upon determination of a Cybersecurity Incident on a Market Participant\u2019s computer network or system that interfaces with an ERCOT computer network or system, the Market Participant shall notify ERCOT. \n(3)\tFor purposes of this section, in the event a Market Participant delegates authority to an agent, the Market Participant shall ensure that the agent is obligated to notify the Market Participant, as soon as practicable, upon the agent\u2019s discovery of a Cybersecurity Incident on the agent\u2019s computer network or system that interfaces with an ERCOT computer network or system. \n(4)\tA Market Participant shall notify ERCOT, as soon as practicable, upon the agent\u2019s notification to the Market Participant of a Cybersecurity Incident on the agent\u2019s computer network or system that interfaces with an ERCOT computer network or system for the purpose of transacting with ERCOT on behalf of the Market Participant.  If a Market Participant\u2019s agent is also registered with ERCOT as a Market Participant, only the agent is required to report a Cybersecurity Incident on its computer network or system that interfaces with an ERCOT computer network or system to ERCOT.  The failure of an agent to notify the Market Participant of a Cybersecurity Incident shall not constitute a violation of this section if the Market Participant can demonstrate that a reporting mandate exists in a contract between the Market Participant and its agent.\n(5)\tIn order to notify ERCOT of a Cybersecurity Incident, Market Participants shall submit a Notice of Cybersecurity Incident (Section 23, Form O, Notice of Cybersecurity Incident) to NCSI@ercot.com.  If, as a result of the Cybersecurity Incident, a Market Participant is unable to securely send the Notice of Cybersecurity Incident to ERCOT, the Market Participant shall call the ERCOT HelpDesk at (512) 248-6800 and/or its Client Service Representative to request a secure means for sending the Notice of Cybersecurity Incident to ERCOT.\n(a)\tA Market Participant may designate a temporary cybersecurity contact for a particular Cybersecurity Incident by providing contact information for such individual in the Notice of Cybersecurity Incident form submitted to ERCOT. Should a Market Participant designate a temporary cybersecurity contact in its Notice of Cybersecurity Incident, ERCOT will direct communications concerning that particular Cybersecurity Incident to the temporary cybersecurity contact.\n(b)\tFollowing initial notification, Market Participant shall provide ERCOT with updated information concerning the Cybersecurity Incident as it becomes available, and upon ERCOT\u2019s request, until ERCOT provides notice to Market Participant that information regarding the Cybersecurity Incident is no longer needed.  To the extent practicable, the Notice of Cybersecurity Incident form shall be used to provide ERCOT with updated information.\n(6)\tIn the event ERCOT determines that a Cybersecurity Incident may materially impact computer networks or systems of ERCOT and/or Market Participants, ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice to all Market Participants with general information concerning the Cybersecurity Incident.  ERCOT may utilize the information contained in a Notice of Cybersecurity Incident, except that in no event shall the Market Notice contain information identifiable to a specific Market Participant or ERCOT Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (ECEII).\n16.19\tDesignation of Transmission Operators \n(1)\tEach Transmission Service Provider (TSP) shall either register as a Transmission Operator (TO) or designate one or more other Transmission and/or Distribution Service Providers (TDSPs) as its TO for each Transmission Facility owned by the TSP.  Each DSP shall either register as a TO or designate another TDSP as its TO.  A TDSP shall designate another Entity as its TO only with the written consent of that other Entity.  \n(2)\tA TO shall have full authority to act on behalf of the designating TDSP in the performance of all TO responsibilities provided in the ERCOT Protocols or Other Binding Documents, including effectuating any Load-shed that may be necessary during any Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) event, Under-Frequency Load Shed (UFLS) event, or Under-Voltage Load Shed (UVLS) event.  \n(3)\tTo qualify for designation as a TO, a TDSP shall be connected to the ERCOT Wide Area Network (WAN) and maintain 24-hour, seven-day-per-week operations and Hotline communications with ERCOT.  A TO has a responsibility to answer each TO Hotline call.\n(4)\tA TSP shall enter a TO designation for each Transmission Facility it owns in the Network Operations Model.  Any designation or change to that designation shall be submitted to ERCOT within the time required for submitting physical changes to the Network Operations Model specified in paragraph (3) of Section 3.10.1, Time Line for Network Operations Model Changes.  Any TSP designated as a TO for another TSP\u2019s facilities may unilaterally reject or resign from that designation by providing written notice to the designating TSP and the TSP shall promptly update the TO designation in the Network Operations Model for the affected Transmission Facility.  \n(5)\tERCOT shall post a Transmission Operator Designation Form on the ERCOT website.  A Distribution Service Provider (DSP) may designate a TO or make any change to its designation, including revoking a TO designation, by properly completing the Transmission Operator Designation Form and submitting it via email to ERCOT with a copy provided to the TDSP designated as TO.  Any such change shall be submitted to ERCOT at least 30 days before the change becomes effective.  The designation of a TO shall not be effective unless the Transmission Operator Designation Form has been signed by an officer or other Authorized Representative of the designating DSP and the TDSP designated as TO.  \n(6)\tA TO for a DSP may unilaterally resign from a designation as TO by submitting a properly completed Transmission Operator Designation Form to ERCOT reflecting the TO\u2019s resignation of its TO status at least 30 days before the resignation becomes effective.

This Section details how Load Profiling will be implemented in ERCOT when ERCOT does not receive 15-minute Settlement Interval consumption data and enables the accounting of energy usage in the market Settlement process.\n18.2\tMethodology\n(1)\tA Load Profiling Methodology is the fundamental basis on which Load Profiles are created.  The implementation of a Load Profiling Methodology may require statistical Sampling, engineering methods, econometric modeling, or other approaches.  All Load Profiles shall conform to the ERCOT-defined Settlement Interval length.\n(2) \tERCOT has developed Load Profiles for: \n(a)\tNon-interval metered Loads;\n(b)\tNon-Metered Loads; and\n(c)        Interval Data Recorders (IDRs) including:\n(i) \tAdvanced Meters; and        \n(ii) \tIDR Meters.\n(3)\tThe following Load Profiling Methodologies are used:\nType of Load\tLoad Profiling Methodology\nNon-interval metered\tAdjusted Static Models\nNon-interval metered with Distributed Generation (DG) \tAdjusted Static Models and engineering estimates\nNon-metered\tEngineering estimates\n18.2.1\tGuidelines for Development of Load Profiles\n(1)\tIn developing Load Profiles, ERCOT shall strive to achieve an optimal combination of the following:\n(a)\tGive no unfair advantage to any Entity;\n(b)\tMaximize usability by minimizing the total number of Load Profiles without compromising accuracy and cost effectiveness;\n(c)\tMinimize the Load Profiles\u2019 contribution to Unaccounted For Energy (UFE) over all Settlement Intervals, paying particular attention to higher cost periods;\n(d)\tReflect reasonably homogenous groups, with respect to Load shape and likely supply costs;\n(e)\tDevelop Load Profiles that are distinctly different;\n(f)\tDevelop Load Profiles for areas with incomplete Load data utilizing data from other sources, taking into account similarities and differences in Load;\n(g)\tAccommodate development of unique rate classes;\n(h)\tUse the most accurate Load research data available; and\n(i)\tDevelop Load Profiles based on readily identifiable parameters that are not subject to frequent change.\n18.2.2\tLoad Profiles for Non-Interval Metered Loads\n18.2.2.1\tLoad Profiles for Non-Interval Metered Loads Without Distributed Generation\n(1)\tLoad Profiles for non-interval metered Loads are created using statistical models developed from appropriate Load research sample data.  These models are referred to as adjusted static.  These model equations relate daily Settlement Interval Load patterns to relevant weather descriptors such as maximum and minimum dry-bulb temperature and humidity.  Other daily characteristics such as day-of-the-week and sunrise/sunset times are also employed.\n18.2.2.2\tLoad Profiles for Non-Interval Metered Loads With Distributed Generation\n(1)\tLoad Profiles for non-interval metered Loads that utilize DG (e.g., PhotoVoltaic (PV) or wind) will be created using a hybrid approach.  At least a portion of the Load Profile will be based on Adjusted Static Models, while engineering estimates and/or generation models may be integrated as well or otherwise utilized.\n18.2.3\tLoad Profiles for Non-Metered Loads\n(1)\tLoad Profiles for Non-Metered Loads, e.g. streetlights, traffic signals, security lighting, billboards, and parking lots are created using engineering estimates based on known criteria, such as hours of operation, with appropriate variation in sunrise/sunset times.  Transmission Service Providers (TSPs) and/or Distribution Service Providers (DSPs) are responsible for providing monthly consumption (kWh) for non-metered Electric Service Identifiers (ESI IDs).\n18.2.4\tDefault Load Profiles for Interval Data Recorders\n(1)\tDefault Load Profiles for IDRs will only be used when no historic Customer-specific interval data is available for Settlements.  The Adjusted Static Model methodology will be used to create these Load Profiles.\n(2)\tFor details on the method to estimate IDR data for Settlement purposes, refer to Section 11, Data Acquisition and Aggregation.\n18.2.5\tIdentification of Weather Zones and Load Profile Types\n(1)\tERCOT, in coordination with the appropriate Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) subcommittee, will identify Weather Zones and Load Profile Types based on an analysis of Load data, weather data, and sunrise/sunset data.\n18.2.6\tDaily Profile Creation Process\n(1)\tERCOT will maintain Load Profile Models to create profiles for the target Settlement day (backcast) and three days following the current day (forecast).  ERCOT will automatically collect actual weather conditions and weather forecasts to enable the creation of the Load Profiles.  ERCOT will maintain sunrise/sunset information for creating Load Profiles that require these parameters.\n18.2.7\tMaintenance of the Load Profile Models\n(1)\tUpon request from the appropriate TAC subcommittee, ERCOT shall review the validity and accuracy of the Load Profile Models.  ERCOT shall make the necessary recommendation to alleviate any situations whereby Load Profiles are no longer representative.\n18.2.8\tAdjustments and Changes to Load Profile Development\n(1)\tAny changes to the Load Profiling Methodology, existing Load Profiles, and/or creation of new Load Profiles shall be in accordance with Load Profiling Guide Section 2.4, Load Profiling Guide Revision Procedure\n(2)\tSection 9.18, Profile Development Cost Recovery Fee for a Non-ERCOT Sponsored Load Profile Segment, describes the process for compensating the originator of a Load Profile Segment change request by Retail Electric Providers (REPs) wishing to subscribe to the Load Profile Segment.\n(3)\tERCOT shall give at least 150 days\u2019 Notice to all Market Participants prior to market implementation of any change to the Load Profiling Methodology, existing Load Profiles, or when any additional Load Profiles are developed.  This Notice shall include a Load Profile change implementation timeline, which specifies dates on which key events during the Load Profile change process will take place.  Upon any change in Load Profile Types, TSPs and/or DSPs shall send any revised Load Profile ID assignments required by the change to the registration system within the implementation timeline.  After the new Load Profile(s) becomes available, changes to Load Profile Types will be effective on the next meter read date for each ESI ID.\n(4)\tIf one or more Load Profiles require changes to reduce excessive UFE, as determined by the appropriate TAC subcommittee, TAC may provide a shorter Notice period and implementation date, than otherwise provided herein, for such required changes to Load Profiles.  If the Load Profiling Methodology requires changes to reduce excessive UFE, as determined by the appropriate TAC subcommittee, TAC may provide an expedited Notice period and implementation date.\n18.2.9\tERCOT Responsibilities in Support of Load Profiling\n(1)\tERCOT is responsible for the development and maintenance of Load Profiles used in the ERCOT market.  ERCOT shall follow the Load Profiling and Load research rules and procedures as specified in the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) rules.\n18.3\tPosting\n(1)\tERCOT will make available to Market Participants the following information in a timely manner, subject to confidentiality agreements, proprietary arrangements, and Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) rules.\n18.3.1\tMethodology Information\n(1)\tUpon request, ERCOT will provide a complete description of all supporting Load Profile Models, documentation and data used in preparation of Load Profiles, including:\n(a)\tThe historic Load data used to create the Load Profiles;\n(b)\tAverage interval accuracy of each Load Profile Model;\n(c)\tWeather information;\n(d)\tSunrise/sunset information; and\n(e)\tAny other data used for Load Profile development.\n18.3.2\tLoad Profiling Models\n(1)\tERCOT will make available the Load Profile Models used to produce the forecast and backcast profiles for the Settlement process.  The Load Profile Models shall be accessible via the ERCOT website in a downloadable format.\n18.3.3\tLoad Profiles\n(1)\tERCOT will publish Load Profile data from the Load Profile creation process, in accordance with Section 18.2.6, Daily Profile Creation Process, to the ERCOT website and through the common application program interface (API).  Load Profile data will be made available to Market Participants for a period of two years.\n(2)\tERCOT will post to the ERCOT website by 1000 Central Prevailing Time (CPT) each Business Day, forecasted Load Profiles for the three following days for each Load Profile Type and Weather Zone.  Backcast Load Profiles for each Load Profile Type and Weather Zone will be available by 1000 CPT of the second Business Day following the backcast day.  No data will be provided that will allow identification of individual Customers.\n18.4\tAssignment of Load Profile ID\n(1)\tEach Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID) is required to be associated with an appropriate Load Profile ID.  Upon request, ERCOT and the appropriate Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) subcommittee shall review the Load Profile ID assignment process, make recommendations for enhancements, and evaluate the integration of the validation and assignment processes.  This Section details the process of assigning a Load Profile ID to each ESI ID.\n18.4.1\tDevelopment of Load Profile ID Assignment Table\n(1)\tERCOT shall develop a cross-reference table of all Load Profile IDs used in the ERCOT market.  The table shall clearly state class relationship to Load Profile Type.  This information shall be made accessible on the ERCOT website.  The cross-reference information shall be compiled and expressed in clear, unambiguous language, and in a manner that will minimize Load Profile ID assignment disputes.\n18.4.2\tLoad Profile ID Assignment\n(1)\tAll Load Profile ID assignments shall conform with the valid combinations within the Load Profiling Guide Appendix D, Profile Decision Tree.\n(2)\tShould there be any change in Load Profile ID assignment to any ESI ID, it will be the responsibility of the Transmission Service Provider (TSP) and/or Distribution Service Provider (DSP) to submit those changes to ERCOT.\n(3)       Competitive Retailers (CRs) may dispute a Load Profile ID assignment through the process described in Load Profiling Guide Section 14, Load Profile ID Dispute Procedure.\n(4)       TSPs and/or DSPs shall change the assignment of a Load Profile ID based on a dispute outcome finding in favor of a CR.  If required to change an assignment, TSPs and/or DSPs must correct the assignment in their system and the ERCOT Customer registration system within three Business Days.\n18.4.3\tValidation of Load Profile Type and Weather Zone Assignments\n(1)\tIn this Section validation shall mean performing checks to ensure correct assignment of Load Profile Types and Weather Zones to ESI IDs.\n18.4.3.1\tValidation Process\n (1)\tValidation of Load Profile Type and Weather Zone assignments, at a minimum, will be performed as follows: \n(a)\tInitial Load Profile ID assignment for opt-in Entities; \n(b)\tWhen a change is made in the Load Profile Type or Weather Zone assignment; \n(c)\tOne time per year for the Business Load Profiles; and\n(d)\tAt least one time every three years for the Residential Load Profiles during the Load Profile validation process.\n(2)\tDetails of the validation process will be specified in the Load Profiling Guide Section 11, Validation of Load Profile ID.\n(3)\tAny Market Participant may request temporary changes to the process for validating Load Profile IDs to address unusual circumstances.  Such change requests shall be recommended by the appropriate TAC subcommittee and approved by TAC.  Change requests as a result of an extreme event such as a hurricane or ice storm may be approved directly by TAC.  Such requests, if approved by the TAC, shall be in effect only for the requested year.\n18.4.3.2\tCorrection Procedure\n(1)\tTSPs and/or DSPs are responsible for investigating each ESI ID identified by ERCOT or a Market Participant as having a potentially incorrect Load Profile ID assignment.  Market Participants may dispute an assignment of a Load Profile ID as described in Load Profiling Guide Section 14, Load Profile ID Dispute Procedure.\n18.4.4\tAssignment of Weather Zones to Electric Service Identifiers\n(1)\tTSPs and /or DSPs will assign each ESI ID to a Weather Zone, based on service address ZIP code.\n(2)\tERCOT will post to the ERCOT website a mapping of a Weather Zone to appropriate Customer registration element used in assigning Weather Zones.\n18.5\tAdditional Responsibilities\n(1)\tThis Section addresses responsibilities for Load Profiling not specified in other sections of the Protocols.\n18.5.1\tERCOT Responsibilities\n(1)\tERCOT will develop, administer, and maintain Load Profiles in accordance with these Protocols.  There may be extenuating circumstances including, but not limited to, prolonged widespread power outages that may necessitate ERCOT\u2019s discretion for adjusting non-Interval Data Recorder (IDR) backcasted Load Profiles.  If an event requires ERCOT to utilize this discretion, ERCOT shall send a Market Notice within three Business Days of making the adjustments and report its action(s) and reason(s) for doing so to the next meeting of the appropriate Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) subcommittee.\n(2)\tAny disputes related to the accuracy, appropriateness, or adjustment of Load Profiles shall be handled in accordance with Section 9.14, Settlement and Billing Dispute Process.\n18.5.2\tMarket Participant Responsibilities\n(1)\tMarket Participants shall use the appropriate TAC subcommittee as a forum for their input in the development and refinement of Load Profiles.\n(2)\tCompetitive Retailers (CRs) shall be responsible for reviewing any assignment of Load Profiles to Electric Service Identifiers (ESI IDs) they represent.\n18.6\tInstallation and Use of Interval Data Recorders\n18.6.1\tInterval Data Recorder Mandatory Installation Requirements\n(1)\tInterval Data Recorders (IDRs) are required and shall be installed and utilized for Settlement of Premises having either:\n(a)\tA peak Demand greater than 700 kW (or 700 kVA in CenterPoint Energy\u2019s service territory); or\n(b)\tService provided at transmission voltage (above 60 kV).\n(2)\tAll non-metered Loads such as street lighting, regardless of the aggregation level, shall not be required to install IDRs under the IDR Mandatory Installation Requirements.  These Loads shall be settled using Load Profiles.\n(3)\tMunicipally Owned Utilities (MOUs) and Electric Cooperatives (ECs) that opt-in to Customer Choice must install IDRs at all Premises subject to the IDR Mandatory Installation Requirements for metering prior to the effective date of their participation in the testing and integration requirements of ERCOT systems for Customer Choice.\n18.7\tTransition of Interval Data Recorder Meter to AMS Profile Type\n(1)\tAt a Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider\u2019s (TDSP\u2019s) discretion, or upon a Customer\u2019s request and TDSP\u2019s approval, a TDSP shall:",

The Texas SET Implementation Guides and Texas SET Change Control process documents shall be posted on the ERCOT website.  The Texas SET Implementation Guides shall serve as the standard for the applicable TX SETs among all Market Participants and ERCOT.\n(2)\tThis Section shall cover:\n(a)\tTransactions between Transmission and/or Distribution Service Providers (TDSPs) (refers to all TDSPs unless otherwise specified), Competitive Retailers (CRs) and ERCOT;\n(b)\tTechnical Advisory Committee (TAC) subcommittee and ERCOT responsibilities; and\n(c)\tTexas SET Change Control process.\n19.2\tMethodology\n(1)\tIn developing and maintaining the implementation guides, the appropriate Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) subcommittee shall:\n(a)\tDevelop standardized transactions, which support documented ERCOT market business requirements across all Market Participants and ERCOT;\n(b)\tDevelop Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions using American National Standards Institute Accredited Standards Committee X12 (ANSI ASC X12) standards;\n(c)\tDevelop Extensible Markup Language (XML) transactions as needed;\n(d)\tDevelop other spreadsheets, templates, comma separated value (CSV) files, etc. as needed;\n(e)\tFollow \u2018Best Practices\u2019 as identified in the overall technology market place related to development of Texas Standard Electronic Transactions (TX SETs); and\n(f)\tDevelop processes and procedures for the management of changes to TX SETs and the release of new versions of TX SETs.\n19.3\tTexas Standard Electronic Transaction Definitions\n19.3.1\tDefined Texas Standard Electronic Transactions\n(1)\tService Order Request (650_01)\nThis transaction set:\n(a)\tFrom the Competitive Retailer (CR) to the Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) via point to point protocol, is used to initiate the original service order request, cancel request, or change/update request.\n(b)\tFor every 650_01, Service Order Request, there will be a 650_02, Service Order Response. \n(2)\tService Order Response (650_02)\nThis transaction set:\n(a)\tFrom the TDSP to the CR via point to point protocol, is used to send a response to the CR\u2019s original 650_01, Service Order Request, that the transaction is complete, complete unexecutable, rejected, or requires a permit.\n(b)\tFor every 650_01 transaction, there will be a 650_02 transaction.\n(3)\tPlanned or Unplanned Outage Notification (650_04)\nThis transaction set:\n(a)\tFrom the TDSP to the CR via point to point protocol, is used to notify the CR of a suspension of delivery service or to cancel the suspension of delivery service.\n(b)\tFrom Municipally Owned Utility/Electric Cooperative (MOU/EC) TDSP to CR via point to point protocol, is used to notify the CR of disconnect/reconnect of delivery service for non-payment of wires charges, unless otherwise indicated in Retail Market Guide Section 8.1, Municipally Owned Utility and/or Electric Cooperative Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider Market.\n(4)\tPlanned or Unplanned Outage Response (650_05)\nThis transaction set is no longer valid as of Texas Standard Electronic Transaction (SET) 4.0.\n(5)\tTDSP Invoice (810_02)\nThis transaction set:\nFrom the TDSP to the CR via point to point protocol, is an invoice for wire charges as listed in each TDSP tariff (i.e., delivery charges, late payment charges, discretionary service charges, etc.).  The 810_02, TDSP Invoice, may be paired with an 867_03, Monthly or Final Usage, to trigger the Customer billing process.\n(6)\tMOU/EC Invoice (810_03)\nThis transaction set:\nFrom the CR to the MOU/EC TDSP via point to point protocol, is an invoice for monthly energy charges, discretionary, and service charges for the current billing period, unless otherwise indicated in Retail Market Guide Section 8.1.  The 810_03, MOU/EC Invoice, will be preceded by an 867_03, Monthly or Final Usage, to trigger the Customer billing process.\n(7)\tMaintain Customer Information Request (814_PC)\nThis transaction set:\n(a)\tFrom a CR to the TDSP via point to point protocol, is used to maintain the information needed by the TDSP to verify the CR\u2019s end use Customer\u2019s identity (i.e., name, address and contact phone number) for a particular point of delivery served by the CR.  A CR shall be required to provide TDSP with the information to contact the Customer and to continuously provide TDSP updates of changes in such information. \n(b)\tFrom the CR to the TDSP via point to point protocol, will be transmitted only after the CR has received the 867_04, Initial Meter Read, from the TDSP for that specific move in Customer.  Also, the CR will not transmit this transaction set and/or provide any updates to the TDSP after receiving the 867_03, Monthly or Final Usage, final meter read for that specific move out Customer.  \n(c)\tFrom a MOU/EC TDSP to CR via point to point protocol, is used to provide the CR with updated Customer information (name, address, membership ID, home phone number, etc.) for a particular point of delivery served by both the MOU/EC TDSP and the CR and to continuously provide CR updates of such information, unless otherwise indicated in Retail Market Guide Section 8.1.\n(8)\tMaintain Customer Information Response (814_PD)\nThis transaction set:\nFrom the TDSP to the CR via point to point protocol, or from the CR to MOU/EC TDSP via point to point protocol, unless otherwise indicated in Retail Market Guide Section 8.1, is used to respond to the 814_PC, Maintain Customer Information Request.\n(9)\tSwitch Request (814_01)\nThis transaction set:\nFrom a new CR to ERCOT, is used to begin the Customer enrollment process for a switch.\n(10)\tSwitch Reject Response (814_02)\nThis transaction set:\nFrom ERCOT to the new CR, is used by ERCOT to reject the 814_01, Switch Request, based on incomplete or invalid information.  This is a conditional transaction and will only be used as a negative response.

R. 25.503, Oversight of Wholesale Market Participants, is not required to follow the ADR procedure prior to seeking relief from the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) or other Governmental Authority.\n(2)\tOnly a Counter-Party may request ADR to seek correction of Settlement data and resettlement, except that:\n(a)\tA Market Participant that is not a Counter-Party may submit an ADR request seeking correction of Settlement data and resettlement on behalf of an affected Counter-Party upon providing ERCOT written documentation executed by the Authorized Representative of the Counter-Party designating the Market Participant as the Counter-Party\u2019s agent for purposes of submitting the ADR request; and\n(b)\tA Load Serving Entity (LSE), with its Counter-Party, or a Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) may submit an ADR request for correction of Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID) service history, usage information, and/or resettlement, as set forth in these Protocols and the Retail Market Guide.\n(3)\tNothing in this ADR procedure is intended to limit or restrict the right of a Market Participant to file a petition seeking direct relief from the PUCT or another Governmental Authority without first exhausting this ADR procedure where actual or threatened action by ERCOT or a Market Participant could cause irreparable harm and where such harm cannot be addressed within the time permitted under the ADR process.\n(4)\tExcept for the provisions of this Section 20.1, the ADR procedure may be modified by mutual agreement of the parties.\n(5)\tParties shall exercise good faith efforts to timely resolve disputes under Section 20.\n(6)\tNothing contained in Section 20 is intended to supersede any dispute resolution process mandated by applicable law or tariff.  Furthermore, this ADR procedure does not apply to any dispute concerning an agreement between Market Participants or the terms of any tariff.  To the extent any dispute not governed by Section 20 involves the interpretation of the ERCOT Protocols, an Other Binding Document, or an Agreement, that dispute may be submitted to ERCOT through the Protocol interpretation request process described in subsection (i) of P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.503.\n20.2\tDeadline for Initiating ADR Proceeding\n(1)\tThe following deadlines shall apply for the initiation of an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) proceeding:\n(a)\tFor any ADR proceeding invoked in connection with a Settlement and billing dispute submitted pursuant to Section 9.14, Settlement and Billing Disputes, the Market Participant must submit a complete written request for ADR no later than 45 days after the resolution date on which ERCOT denied the Market Participant\u2019s Settlement and billing dispute.\n(b)\tFor any ADR proceeding invoked in connection with the rejection or rescission (or a portion thereof) of a verifiable cost, or rejection of a verifiable cost appeal, the Market Participant must submit a complete written request for ADR no later than 45 days after either:\n(i)\tRejection or rescission (or a portion thereof) of a verifiable cost; or \n(ii)\tNotice from ERCOT that the appeal, in whole or in part, has been rejected. \n(c)\tFor any ADR proceeding invoked in connection with a disagreement arising from a Data Extract Variance process, the Market Participant must submit a complete written request for ADR no later than 45 days after issuance of the True-Up Statement for the applicable Operating Day.\n(d)\tFor any ADR proceeding invoked in connection with any other matter, the Market Participant must submit a complete written request for ADR no later than six months after the date on which information giving rise to the ADR request became available to the Market Participant.\n(2)\tIf the Market Participant requesting ADR does not submit a complete written request for ADR (as set forth in Section 20.4, Initiation of ADR Proceedings) within the time required by paragraph (1) above, the Market Participant waives any claim regarding the dispute.\n20.3\tExhaustion of Other Dispute Resolution Procedures\n(1)\tWhen a section of these Protocols, an Other Binding Document, or an Agreement sets forth a dispute resolution procedure, a Market Participant shall exhaust that procedure prior to initiating an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) proceeding, including but not limited to the following:\n(a)\tIf a Market Participant seeks resolution of a variance subject to the Data Extract Variance Process, the Market Participant must comply with that process prior to initiating an ADR proceeding, or the claim is waived.\n(b)\tIf a Counter-Party seeks correction of Settlement data and resettlement, except for resolution of a variance subject to the Data Extract Variance Process as described in paragraph (a) above, the Counter-Party must comply with the process set forth in Section 9.14, Settlement and Billing Dispute Process, prior to initiating an ADR proceeding, or the claim is waived.  \n20.4\tInitiation of ADR Proceedings\n(1)\tTo initiate an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) proceeding, a Market Participant shall complete and submit to the ERCOT Legal Department the designated form provided on the ERCOT website in the manner required by the form.\n(a)\tAll written requests shall include the following information:\n(i)\tThe name of the disputing Market Participant;\n(ii)\tA description of the relief sought;\n(iii)\tA detailed description of the grounds for the relief and the basis of each claim that must, at a minimum, identify which statute(s), rule(s), Protocol Section(s), Other Binding Document(s), Agreement(s) or other law(s) are alleged to have been violated;\n(iv)\tA list of all other parties that would be affected by the dispute; and\n(v)\tDesignation of a senior dispute representative.  \n(b)\tFor ADR proceedings for which the Market Participant seeks a monetary resolution, the Market Participant shall also include the following information:\n(i)\tOperating Day(s) involved in the dispute;\n(ii)\tSettlement dispute number (if applicable); and\n(iii)\tAmount of compensation requested.\n(2)\tThe date on which ERCOT receives the completed ADR written request shall be the ADR initiation date.\n20.5\tAlternative Dispute Resolution Process\n(1)\tNo later than seven days after the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) initiation date, ERCOT shall determine, and provide Notice to, all parties directly involved in the dispute.  Such Notice shall include the ADR file number and the designation of the ERCOT senior dispute representative.  \n(2)\tFor ADR proceedings that involve more than one Market Participant, each Market Participant other than the Market Participant that submitted the ADR request shall provide the name and contact information of a senior dispute representative no later than seven days after receipt of Notice from ERCOT pursuant to paragraph (1) above.  If a Market Participant does not provide this information within the time required, the Market Participant waives its right to participate in the ADR proceeding.\n(3)\tAny dispute subject to ADR as described in this Section shall be referred to a senior dispute representative of each of the parties to the dispute.  The senior dispute representative shall be an individual with authority to resolve the dispute (through delegation or otherwise).  A disputing party may change its senior dispute representative upon reasonable written notice to all parties though such redesignation shall not extend any of the ADR timelines.\n(4)\tThe parties to the dispute shall arrange a mutually convenient time and place for a meeting, with the initial ADR meeting taking place no later than 75 days after the ADR initiation date unless all parties agree to an extension of time.  If the party that submitted the request for ADR fails to make reasonable efforts to schedule and attend the initial ADR meeting within the time required (including any agreed-upon extension of time), ERCOT may, in its sole discretion, deny the dispute.\n(5)\tAfter the initial ADR meeting, ERCOT may approve or deny the dispute in whole or in part by issuing the disposition Market Notice described in paragraph (1) of Section 20.9, Resolution of Alternative Dispute Resolution Proceedings and Notification to Market Participants.  ERCOT must issue the Market Notice disposing of the ADR request no later than 30 days after the initial ADR meeting unless all parties agree in writing to an extension of time.\n(6)\tIf the senior dispute representatives cannot resolve the dispute by mutual agreement within 45 days after the initial senior dispute resolution meeting (unless all parties agree in writing to an extension of time), then, upon the agreement of all parties to the ADR, the dispute may be referred to mediation pursuant to Section 20.6, Mediation Procedures.\n(7)\tThe parties to the dispute may elect to waive ADR by written agreement, which will also complete the ADR proceeding. \n(8)\tThe following table summarizes the ADR process timelines:\nDeadline to submit ADR Request \nto ERCOT\tERCOT \nNotice of Receipt\t Other Market Participant\nContact Info \nto ERCOT1\t\tERCOT/ Market Participant\nInitial ADR meeting\tERCOT/ Market Participant\nresolution of ADR",

Except as specifically provided otherwise in the following sentence or in other sections of these Protocols, Sections 21.2, Submission of a Nodal Protocol Revision Request or System Change Request, through 21.8, Review of Guide Changes, apply to all NPRRs.  ERCOT Members, Market Participants, Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) Staff, the Reliability Monitor, the Independent Market Monitor (IMM), the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Regional Entity, ERCOT, and any other Entities are required to utilize the process described herein prior to requesting, through the PUCT or other Governmental Authority, that ERCOT make a change to these Protocols, except for good cause shown to the PUCT or other Governmental Authority.\n(2)\tA request that ERCOT change its computer systems that does not require a revision to the Protocols is called a System Change Request (SCR).  Except as specifically provided in other sections of these Protocols, Sections 21.2 through 21.7, Review of Project Prioritization and Annual Budget Process, apply to all SCRs.\n(3)\tThe \u201cnext regularly scheduled meeting\u201d of the Protocol Revision Subcommittee (PRS), the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), an assigned TAC subcommittee (as defined below), the ERCOT Board, or the PUCT, shall mean the next regularly scheduled meeting for which required notice can be timely given regarding the item(s) to be addressed, as specified in the appropriate PUCT, ERCOT Board, or committee procedures.\n(4)\tERCOT may make non-substantive corrections at any time during the processing of a particular NPRR.  Under certain circumstances, however, the Nodal Protocols can also be revised by ERCOT rather than using the NPRR process outlined in Section 21.4, Nodal Protocol Revision and System Change Procedure.\n(a)\tThis type of revision is referred to as an \u201cAdministrative NPRR\u201d or \u201cAdministrative Changes\u201d and shall consist of non-substantive corrections, such as typos (excluding grammatical changes), internal references (including table of contents), improper use of acronyms, and references to ERCOT Protocols, PUCT Substantive Rules, the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA), NERC regulations, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rules, etc.  Additionally, updates to Section 23, Forms, may also be processed as Administrative NPRRs.  \n(b)\tERCOT shall post such Administrative NPRRs to the ERCOT website and distribute the NPRR to PRS.  If no Entity submits comments to the Administrative NPRR within ten Business Days in accordance with paragraph (1) of Section 21.4.4, Protocol Revision Subcommittee Review and Action, the Administrative NPRR shall be subject to PUCT approval.  Following PUCT approval, ERCOT shall implement the Administrative NPRR according to paragraph (4) of Section 21.6, Nodal Protocol Revision Implementation.  If any Entity submits comments to the Administrative NPRR, then it shall be processed in accordance with the NPRR process outlined in Section 21.4.\n21.2\tSubmission of a Nodal Protocol Revision Request or System Change Request\n(1)\tThe following Entities may submit a Nodal Protocol Revision Request (NPRR) or System Change Request (SCR) (\u201cRevision Request\u201d):\n(a)\tAny Market Participant;\n(b)\tAny ERCOT Member;\n(c)\tPublic Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) Staff;\n(d)\tThe Reliability Monitor;\n(e)\tThe North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Regional Entity;\n(f)\tThe Independent Market Monitor (IMM);\n(g)\tERCOT; and\n(h)\tAny other Entity that meets the following qualifications:\n(i)\tResides (or represents residents) in Texas or operates in the Texas electricity market; and\n(ii)\tDemonstrates that Entity (or those it represents) is affected by the Customer Registration or Renewable Energy Credit (REC) Trading Program sections of these Protocols.\n21.3\tProtocol Revision Subcommittee\n(1)\tThe Protocol Revision Subcommittee (PRS) shall review and recommend action on formally submitted Nodal Protocol Revision Requests (NPRRs) and System Change Requests (SCRs) (\u201cRevision Requests\u201d) provided that:\n(a)\tPRS meetings are open to ERCOT, ERCOT Members, Market Participants, the Reliability Monitor, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Regional Entity, the Independent Market Monitor (IMM), and the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) Staff;\n(b)\tEach Market Segment is allowed to participate; and\n(c)\tEach Market Segment has equal voting power.\n(2)\tWhere additional expertise is needed, the PRS may refer a Revision Request to working groups or task forces that it creates or to existing Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) subcommittees, working groups or task forces for review and comment on the Revision Request.  Suggested modifications\u2014or alternative modifications if a consensus recommendation is not achieved by a non-voting working group or task force\u2014to the Revision Request should be submitted by the chair or the chair\u2019s designee on behalf of the subcommittee, working group or task force as comments on the Revision Request for consideration by PRS.  However, the PRS shall retain ultimate responsibility for the processing of all Revision Requests.\n(3)\tERCOT shall consult with the PRS chair to coordinate and establish the meeting schedule for the PRS.

ERCOT may provide information to the submitter that will correct the NPRR and render it complete.  An incomplete NPRR shall not receive further consideration until it is completed.  In order to pursue the NPRR, a submitter must submit a completed version of the NPRR.\n(4)\tIf a submitted NPRR is complete or upon completion of an NPRR, ERCOT shall post the NPRR on the ERCOT website and distribute to the Protocol Revision Subcommittee (PRS) within three Business Days.\n(5)\tFor any ERCOT-sponsored NPRR, ERCOT shall also post an initial Impact Analysis on the ERCOT website, and distribute it to PRS.  The initial Impact Analysis will provide PRS with guidance as to potential ERCOT computer systems, operations, or business functions that could be affected by the submitted NPRR.\n21.4.2\tReview and Posting of System Change Requests\n(1)\tSystem Change Requests (SCRs) shall be submitted electronically to ERCOT by completing the designated form provided on the ERCOT website.  Excluding ERCOT-sponsored SCRs, ERCOT shall provide an electronic return receipt response to the submitter upon receipt of the SCR.  \n(2)\tThe SCR shall include the following information:\n(a)\tDescription of desired additional system functionality or the additional information desired and reason for suggested change;\n(b)\tImpacts and benefits of the suggested change to ERCOT market structure, ERCOT operations and Market Participants, to the extent that submitter may know this information;\n(c)\tGeneral administrative information (organization, contact name, etc.); and\n(d)\tSummary of requested changes to ERCOT systems.\n(3)\tERCOT shall evaluate the SCR to determine whether the request should be submitted as an NPRR.  If ERCOT determines that the SCR should be submitted as an NPRR, ERCOT will notify the submitter within five Business Days of receipt, and the submitter shall withdraw its SCR and may submit an NPRR in its place.  If ERCOT deems it necessary for further review beyond the five Business Days, ERCOT shall notify the submitter.\n(4)\tERCOT shall evaluate the SCR for completeness and shall notify the submitter, within five Business Days, if the SCR is incomplete, including the reasons for such status.  ERCOT may provide information to the submitter that will correct the SCR and render it complete.  An incomplete SCR shall not receive further consideration until it is completed.  In order to pursue the SCR requested, the submitting Entity must submit a completed version of the SCR.\n(5)\tIf a submitted SCR is complete or upon completion of an SCR, ERCOT shall post the SCR on the ERCOT website and distribute to the PRS within three Business Days.\n(6)\tFor any ERCOT-sponsored SCR, ERCOT shall also post an initial Impact Analysis on the ERCOT website, and distribute it to PRS.

These point to point transactions may be Customer requested service orders and CR/TDSP invoicing and remittance.\n24.1\tMaintenance Service Order Request\n(1)\tTo initiate an original service order, cancel, or change (update) request, the Competitive Retailer (CR) sends maintenance related information to the Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) using the 650_01, Service Order Request.  The 650_01 transaction sent by the CR shall include a level of information such that the TDSP clearly understands the nature of the request and the work that it is being requested to perform.  The TDSP will respond within one Retail Business Day after completion, or attempted completion, of the requested action using the 650_02, Service Order Response, to notify the CR that the service order is either completed, unable to be completed, or rejected, or that a permit is required before the order can be completed.  There is a one-to-one relationship between the 650_01 and 650_02 transactions.\n24.1.1\tDisconnect/Reconnect\n(1)\tPublic Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) Substantive Rules and orders, along with TDSP tariffs, dictate the timeline for both disconnection for non-payment and reconnection after disconnection for non-payment.  For more information please refer to the Retail Market Guide Section 7.6, Disconnect and Reconnect for Non-Payment Process.\n24.1.2\tSuspension of Delivery Service \n(1)\tThe following transactions shall be used by a TDSP seeking to suspend delivery service for an Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID).\n24.1.2.1\tNotification\n(1)\tThe 650_04, Planned or Unplanned Outage Notification, is electronically transmitted by the TDSP to the CR to notify the CR of the ESI ID(s) and Service Address(es) affected by either a temporary or permanent suspension of service.  The situations under which a 650_04 transaction may be created and transmitted to the CR include:\n(a)\tAn outage has been scheduled by the TDSP for the Customer's Service Address for a specific date and time.  This type of suspension may be the result of scheduled tree trimming, electrical inspection, testing, maintenance, or changes/upgrades to network equipment.\n(b)\tAn outage has occurred at the Customer's Service Address, but it was not planned or previously scheduled.  Such a suspension is normally needed to remedy a dangerous electrical condition that exists at the Customer's address due to an event or activity such as a fire, meter tampering, or theft of service.\n(c)\tFor circumstances when a CR, the Customer, or authorized legal authority (county, city, fire, or police personnel) requests disconnection and meter removal because a structure has been destroyed or demolished, or the TDSP has found the meter removed by an unknown Entity, or has removed the meter for unsafe conditions, the TDSP will send a 650_04 transaction.  In events where the CR receives a 650_04 transaction indicating that service to the Premise has been permanently suspended by the TDSP for one of the reasons indicated above, the CR will send an 814_24, Move Out Request, to the TDSP within ten Retail Business Days.\n(d)\tJust like a suspension is scheduled or requested it can also be cancelled.  If the suspension request is cancelled for any reason, the TDSP will create a 650_04 transaction indicating that the suspension has been cancelled and send a 650_04 transaction to the CR for every ESI ID that would have been affected by the outage.\n(2)\tTo notify the CR of a suspension of delivery service, the TDSP sends Notice to the CR using the 650_04 transaction.  \n24.1.2.2\tCancellation\n(1)\tTo notify the CR of a cancellation of the Notification of suspension of delivery service, the TDSP sends Notice to the CR using the 650_04, Planned or Unplanned Outage, for each ESI ID that would otherwise have been affected by the outage.\n24.1.3\tSwitch Hold Indicator \n24.1.3.1\tTampering Switch Hold\n(1)\tA tampering switch hold is used when tampering has been determined to have occurred.  A switch hold will be placed on the ESI ID in accordance with P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.126, Adjustments Due to Non-Compliant Meters and Meter Tampering in Areas Where Customer Choice Has Been Introduced.  \n(2)\tTo remove a switch hold indicator, the CR sends the 650_01, Service Order Request, to the TDSP requesting the removal of the switch hold indicator.  The TDSP will respond with the 650_02, Service Order Response, to the CR acknowledging receipt of the service order request.  Confirmation that the service order request has been completed will be received through the 814_20, ESI ID Maintenance Request.\n24.1.3.2\tBill Payment Switch Hold\n(1)\tA bill payment switch hold is used when a Customer has entered into a payment agreement with their current CR.  A switch hold will be placed on the ESI ID in accordance with P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.480, Bill Payment and Adjustments.  \n(a)\tTo add a switch hold indicator, the CR sends the 650_01, Service Order Request, to the TDSP requesting the addition of the switch hold indicator.  The TDSP will respond with the 650_02, Service Order Response, to the CR acknowledging receipt of the service order request.  Confirmation that the service order request has been completed will be received through the 814_20, ESI ID Maintenance Request.  \n(b)\tTo remove a switch hold indicator, the CR sends the 650_01 to the TDSP requesting the removal of the switch hold indicator.  The TDSP will respond with the 650_02 response to the CR acknowledging receipt of the service order request.  Confirmation that the service order request has been completed will be received through the 814_20 transaction.\n24.2\tTransmission and/or Distribution Service Provider to Competitive Retailer Invoice \n(1)\tThe 810_02, TDSP Invoice, may include monthly delivery charges, discretionary service charges, service order charges, interest credit, and/or late payment charges for the current billing period.  Following a positive acknowledgement indicating the transaction passed American National Standards Institute Accredited Standards Committee (ANSI ASC) X12 validation, the Competitive Retailer (CR) shall have five Business Days to send a rejection response in accordance with the Texas Standard Electronic Transaction (TX  SET) Implementation Guides posted on the ERCOT website and Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) Substantive Rules.  If the CR has not received a response transaction to an enrollment or move in, the CR shall not reject the invoice, but will utilize an approved market process (MarkeTrak or dispute process) to resolve the issue.  Details of these processes may be found in the Retail Market Guide Section 7, Market Processes.  \n(2)\tOnly one 810_02 transaction may be sent for a single service period, however, any additional 810_02 transaction for the same Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID) may be sent for a late payment charge after the 35th calendar day for an unpaid 810_02 transaction or for interest credit.\n(3)\tThe 810_02 may be paired with an 867_03, Monthly or Final Usage, to trigger the Customer billing process.\n(4)\tThe Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) may cancel and replace (rebill) the original 810_02 transaction.  The values in the cancel transaction will be identical in amounts to what they were on the original invoice.  The replacement (rebilled) invoice now becomes the monthly invoice for that service period.\n(5)\tIf the 867_03 is cancelled after the TDSP has sent the 810_02 transaction, the TDSP will cancel the 810_02 transaction.  If the 810_02 transaction error is not related to consumption, the TDSP may cancel the 810_02 transaction and not the 867_03 transaction.\n24.3\tMonthly Remittance\n(1)\tTransmission and/or Distribution Service Providers (TDSPs) and Competitive Retailers (CR) shall use the following transactions to remit monthly payments.\n24.3.1\tCompetitive Retailer to Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider Monthly Remittance Advice\n(1)\tThis transaction set, from the CR to the TDSP, is used by the CR to notify the TDSP of payment details related to a specific invoice.  A CR must pass an 820_02, CR Remittance Advice, for every invoice (original, cancel, replacement) received, validated, and accepted by the CR even when a cancel and restatement of usage subsequently cancels the original invoice.\n(2)\tEach Market Participant is responsible for ensuring that the data provided in the 820_02 transaction is presented in a format that is consistent with market specifications prescribed in the Texas Standard Electronic Transaction (TX SET) Implementation Guide posted on the ERCOT website.\n24.3.1.1\tRemittance Advice Total Matches Payment Total\n(1)\tThe remittance advice must match the total payment.  The CR must ensure that the remittance advice and the payment instructions have the same (matching) trace/reference numbers.  A one-to-one correlation must be maintained between payments and remittance advices.  It is acceptable for one payment and one remittance advice to include many invoices.  It is not acceptable for several payments to reference one remittance advice.  Every payment trace/reference number sent via the bank must match a remittance advice trace/reference number sent to the TDSP.  The trace/reference number must be unique for each associated payment and remittance advice.\n24.3.1.2\tNegative Remittance Advice\n(1)\tA negative remittance advice is not allowed in the Texas retail market.  If the adjustments are larger than the payments (creating a negative remittance advice), payments must be held until the CR can submit a net positive remittance advice as a credit against the overpayment.  It is not necessary for a CR to hold an adjustment amount until the CR has accumulated sufficient invoices to result in a complete offset of the overpayment.  Instead the CR may use the adjustment amount by taking a partial credit on another Invoice.

These point to point transactions may be Customer requested service orders and CR/TDSP invoicing and remittance.\n24.1\tMaintenance Service Order Request\n(1)\tTo initiate an original service order, cancel, or change (update) request, the Competitive Retailer (CR) sends maintenance related information to the Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) using the 650_01, Service Order Request.  The 650_01 transaction sent by the CR shall include a level of information such that the TDSP clearly understands the nature of the request and the work that it is being requested to perform.  The TDSP will respond within one Retail Business Day after completion, or attempted completion, of the requested action using the 650_02, Service Order Response, to notify the CR that the service order is either completed, unable to be completed, or rejected, or that a permit is required before the order can be completed.  There is a one-to-one relationship between the 650_01 and 650_02 transactions.\n24.1.1\tDisconnect/Reconnect\n(1)\tPublic Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) Substantive Rules and orders, along with TDSP tariffs, dictate the timeline for both disconnection for non-payment and reconnection after disconnection for non-payment.  For more information please refer to the Retail Market Guide Section 7.6, Disconnect and Reconnect for Non-Payment Process.\n24.1.2\tSuspension of Delivery Service \n(1)\tThe following transactions shall be used by a TDSP seeking to suspend delivery service for an Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID).\n24.1.2.1\tNotification\n(1)\tThe 650_04, Planned or Unplanned Outage Notification, is electronically transmitted by the TDSP to the CR to notify the CR of the ESI ID(s) and Service Address(es) affected by either a temporary or permanent suspension of service.  The situations under which a 650_04 transaction may be created and transmitted to the CR include:\n(a)\tAn outage has been scheduled by the TDSP for the Customer's Service Address for a specific date and time.  This type of suspension may be the result of scheduled tree trimming, electrical inspection, testing, maintenance, or changes/upgrades to network equipment.\n(b)\tAn outage has occurred at the Customer's Service Address, but it was not planned or previously scheduled.  Such a suspension is normally needed to remedy a dangerous electrical condition that exists at the Customer's address due to an event or activity such as a fire, meter tampering, or theft of service.\n(c)\tFor circumstances when a CR, the Customer, or authorized legal authority (county, city, fire, or police personnel) requests disconnection and meter removal because a structure has been destroyed or demolished, or the TDSP has found the meter removed by an unknown Entity, or has removed the meter for unsafe conditions, the TDSP will send a 650_04 transaction.  In events where the CR receives a 650_04 transaction indicating that service to the Premise has been permanently suspended by the TDSP for one of the reasons indicated above, the CR will send an 814_24, Move Out Request, to the TDSP within ten Retail Business Days.\n(d)\tJust like a suspension is scheduled or requested it can also be cancelled.  If the suspension request is cancelled for any reason, the TDSP will create a 650_04 transaction indicating that the suspension has been cancelled and send a 650_04 transaction to the CR for every ESI ID that would have been affected by the outage.\n(2)\tTo notify the CR of a suspension of delivery service, the TDSP sends Notice to the CR using the 650_04 transaction.  \n24.1.2.2\tCancellation\n(1)\tTo notify the CR of a cancellation of the Notification of suspension of delivery service, the TDSP sends Notice to the CR using the 650_04, Planned or Unplanned Outage, for each ESI ID that would otherwise have been affected by the outage.\n24.1.3\tSwitch Hold Indicator \n24.1.3.1\tTampering Switch Hold\n(1)\tA tampering switch hold is used when tampering has been determined to have occurred.  A switch hold will be placed on the ESI ID in accordance with P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.126, Adjustments Due to Non-Compliant Meters and Meter Tampering in Areas Where Customer Choice Has Been Introduced.  \n(2)\tTo remove a switch hold indicator, the CR sends the 650_01, Service Order Request, to the TDSP requesting the removal of the switch hold indicator.  The TDSP will respond with the 650_02, Service Order Response, to the CR acknowledging receipt of the service order request.  Confirmation that the service order request has been completed will be received through the 814_20, ESI ID Maintenance Request.\n24.1.3.2\tBill Payment Switch Hold\n(1)\tA bill payment switch hold is used when a Customer has entered into a payment agreement with their current CR.  A switch hold will be placed on the ESI ID in accordance with P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.480, Bill Payment and Adjustments.  \n(a)\tTo add a switch hold indicator, the CR sends the 650_01, Service Order Request, to the TDSP requesting the addition of the switch hold indicator.  The TDSP will respond with the 650_02, Service Order Response, to the CR acknowledging receipt of the service order request.  Confirmation that the service order request has been completed will be received through the 814_20, ESI ID Maintenance Request.  \n(b)\tTo remove a switch hold indicator, the CR sends the 650_01 to the TDSP requesting the removal of the switch hold indicator.  The TDSP will respond with the 650_02 response to the CR acknowledging receipt of the service order request.  Confirmation that the service order request has been completed will be received through the 814_20 transaction.\n24.2\tTransmission and/or Distribution Service Provider to Competitive Retailer Invoice \n(1)\tThe 810_02, TDSP Invoice, may include monthly delivery charges, discretionary service charges, service order charges, interest credit, and/or late payment charges for the current billing period.  Following a positive acknowledgement indicating the transaction passed American National Standards Institute Accredited Standards Committee (ANSI ASC) X12 validation, the Competitive Retailer (CR) shall have five Business Days to send a rejection response in accordance with the Texas Standard Electronic Transaction (TX  SET) Implementation Guides posted on the ERCOT website and Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) Substantive Rules.  If the CR has not received a response transaction to an enrollment or move in, the CR shall not reject the invoice, but will utilize an approved market process (MarkeTrak or dispute process) to resolve the issue.  Details of these processes may be found in the Retail Market Guide Section 7, Market Processes.  \n(2)\tOnly one 810_02 transaction may be sent for a single service period, however, any additional 810_02 transaction for the same Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID) may be sent for a late payment charge after the 35th calendar day for an unpaid 810_02 transaction or for interest credit.\n(3)\tThe 810_02 may be paired with an 867_03, Monthly or Final Usage, to trigger the Customer billing process.\n(4)\tThe Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) may cancel and replace (rebill) the original 810_02 transaction.  The values in the cancel transaction will be identical in amounts to what they were on the original invoice.  The replacement (rebilled) invoice now becomes the monthly invoice for that service period.\n(5)\tIf the 867_03 is cancelled after the TDSP has sent the 810_02 transaction, the TDSP will cancel the 810_02 transaction.  If the 810_02 transaction error is not related to consumption, the TDSP may cancel the 810_02 transaction and not the 867_03 transaction.\n24.3\tMonthly Remittance\n(1)\tTransmission and/or Distribution Service Providers (TDSPs) and Competitive Retailers (CR) shall use the following transactions to remit monthly payments.\n24.3.1\tCompetitive Retailer to Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider Monthly Remittance Advice\n(1)\tThis transaction set, from the CR to the TDSP, is used by the CR to notify the TDSP of payment details related to a specific invoice.  A CR must pass an 820_02, CR Remittance Advice, for every invoice (original, cancel, replacement) received, validated, and accepted by the CR even when a cancel and restatement of usage subsequently cancels the original invoice.\n(2)\tEach Market Participant is responsible for ensuring that the data provided in the 820_02 transaction is presented in a format that is consistent with market specifications prescribed in the Texas Standard Electronic Transaction (TX SET) Implementation Guide posted on the ERCOT website.\n24.3.1.1\tRemittance Advice Total Matches Payment Total\n(1)\tThe remittance advice must match the total payment.  The CR must ensure that the remittance advice and the payment instructions have the same (matching) trace/reference numbers.  A one-to-one correlation must be maintained between payments and remittance advices.  It is acceptable for one payment and one remittance advice to include many invoices.  It is not acceptable for several payments to reference one remittance advice.  Every payment trace/reference number sent via the bank must match a remittance advice trace/reference number sent to the TDSP.  The trace/reference number must be unique for each associated payment and remittance advice.\n24.3.1.2\tNegative Remittance Advice\n(1)\tA negative remittance advice is not allowed in the Texas retail market.

If the fifth Bank Business Day is not a Business Day, then the payment is due by 1700 on the next Bank Business Day after the fifth Bank Business Day that is also a Business Day. \n(2)\tAll Securitization Default Charge Invoices due, with funds owed by an Invoice Recipient, must be paid to ERCOT in U.S. Dollars (USDs) by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) in immediately available or good funds (i.e., not subject to reversal) on or before the payment due date.  EFTs must be with U.S. banks only.\n(3)\tSecuritization Default Charge Invoices are distinct from other Invoices issued by ERCOT and must be paid by an EFT that is separate from any other Invoice.  An Invoice Recipient may not net amounts owing on a Securitization Default Charge Invoice with any other funds due to or from ERCOT. \n(4)\tPayments for Securitization Default Charges must be made to the account listed on the Invoice.  If payment is not made to the correct account, the payment will be rejected. Failure to remit funds to the correct account may result in a Payment Breach.  The payment remark must include the Invoice number.\n26.3.1.2\tInsufficient Payments by Invoice Recipients for Securitization Default Charge Invoices \n(1)\tIf an Invoice Recipient owing funds does not pay its Securitization Default Charge Invoice in full (short-pay) by the payment due date and time set forth in Section 26.3.1.1, Invoice Recipient Payment to ERCOT for Securitization Default Charge Invoices, ERCOT shall follow the procedure set forth below:\n(a)\tERCOT shall draw on any available Securitization Default Charge escrow deposits by the Invoice Recipient. \n(b)\tIf available Securitization Default Charge escrow deposits are insufficient to cover the short-paid amount, ERCOT will utilize Financial Security held with respect to other ERCOT market activities as determined in Section 16.11.4, Determination and Monitoring of Counter-Party Credit Exposure.  ERCOT may not utilize Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposits to cover short-pays of Securitization Default Charges.\n(c)\tIn the event that an Invoice Recipient short-pays:\n(i)\tBoth a Securitization Default Charge Invoice and a Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoice, or;\n(ii)\tOne or both of the above securitization Invoices as well as any other ERCOT Invoice,\nand it is necessary to utilize Financial Security held with respect to other ERCOT market activities, funds drawn from Financial Security will be allocated first to cover short-pays of Invoices for non-securitization activity.  Any remaining Financial Security will be allocated pro rata on the basis of unpaid Invoice amounts to Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoices and Securitization Default Charge Invoices.\n(d)\tRegardless of whether ERCOT\u2019s draw on available Securitization Default Charge escrow deposits or other Financial Security under paragraphs (a) through (c) above is sufficient to cover the amount owed by a Market Participant for a Securitization Default Charge Invoice, a Market Participant\u2019s failure to pay the Invoice by the payment due date and time will still be deemed a Payment Breach under Section 16.11.6, Payment Breach and Late Payments by Market Participants.  \n(e)\tIf an amount owed to ERCOT for a Securitization Default Charge Invoice cannot be fully recovered from a short-paying Market Participant by drawing upon available Securitization Default Charge escrow deposits, available Financial Security held with respect to other ERCOT market activities, or taking other action against the Market Participant to recover the amount owed, the remaining short payment amount will be taken into consideration in ERCOT\u2019s next evaluation of the Total Securitization Default Charge Monthly Amount performed pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 26.2, Securitization Default Charges, that occurs after the short payment. \n(f)\tAny action taken by under this Section does not relieve or otherwise excuse the short paying Market Participant of its obligation to fully pay all outstanding financial obligations to ERCOT, including is obligation to fully pay all Securitization Default Charge Invoices.\n26.4\tSecuritization Default Charge Supporting Data Reporting\n(1)\tOn a monthly basis, ERCOT shall post the following information on the Market Information System (MIS) Certified Area:\n(a)\tSecuritization Default Charge Maximum MWh Activity (SDCMMA); \n(b)\tSecuritization Default Charge Maximum MWh Activity Total (SDCMMATOT); \n(c)\tSecuritization Default Charge Maximum MWh Activity Ratio Share (SDCMMARS); and \n(d)\tCounter-Party level components of the SDCMMA calculation, as defined in paragraph (2) of Section 26.2, Securitization Default Charges. \n(2)\tERCOT shall post a report containing Initial Settlement data as such data becomes available.  The report shall be updated with Final Settlement data as such data becomes available.\n26.5\tSecuritization Default Charge Escrow Deposit Requirements\n26.5.1 \tSecuritization Default Charge Escrow\n\tThe term \u201cSecuritization Default Charge escrow deposit\u201d means the amount required to be deposited with ERCOT in the form of cash or an unconditional, irrevocable letter of credit to be held in escrow for a Market Participant\u2019s obligation to pay Securitization Default Charges.\n\tAlthough ERCOT is the servicer for the assessment and collection of Securitization Default Charges, by providing escrow deposits pursuant to this Section each Counter-Party grants the Texas Electric Market Stabilization Funding M LLC (TEMSFM) a secured interest in Securitization Default Charge escrow deposits to secure its obligation to pay the same. \n\tThe security interest of TEMSFM is perfected upon a Counter-Party\u2019s deposit of cash or a letter of credit with ERCOT pursuant to this Section. \n26.5.2 \tERCOT Securitization Default Charge Credit Requirements for Counter-Parties  \n\tA Counter-Party must, at all times, maintain its Securitization Default Charge escrow deposit at or above the amount of its Securitization Default Charge Credit Exposure (SDCCE).  Each Counter-Party shall maintain any required Securitization Default Charge escrow deposit in a form acceptable to ERCOT in its sole discretion pursuant to Section 26.5.3, Means of Satisfying Securitization Default Charge Credit Requirements. \n\tIf at any time a Counter-Party does not meet ERCOT\u2019s SDCCE  requirements, then the Counter-Party will be considered to be in Payment Breach and ERCOT may suspend the Counter-Party\u2019s rights under these Protocols until it meets the SDCCE requirements.  \n\tERCOT\u2019s failure to suspend a Counter-Party\u2019s rights on any particular occasion does not prevent ERCOT from suspending those rights on any subsequent occasion, including a Congestion Revenue Right (CRR) Account Holder\u2019s ability to bid on future CRRs or a Qualified Scheduling Entity\u2019s (QSE\u2019s) ability to bid in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM). \n26.5.3\tMeans of Satisfying Securitization Default Charge Credit Requirements\n(1)\tIf a Counter-Party is required to provide a Securitization Default Charge escrow deposit, then it may do so through one or both of the following means:\n(a)\tThe Counter-Party may give an unconditional, irrevocable letter of credit naming TEMSFM as the beneficiary.  ERCOT or the TEMSFM may reject the letter of credit if the issuer is unacceptable to ERCOT or TEMSFM or if the conditions under which ERCOT or TEMSFM may draw against the letter of credit are unacceptable to ERCOT or TEMSFM. \n(b)\tAll letters of credit must be drawn on a US domestic bank or a domestic office of a foreign bank, and must meet the requirements in Section 16.11.3, Alternative Means of Satisfying ERCOT Creditworthiness Requirements. \n(c)\tLetters of credit held as Securitization Default Charge escrow deposits are subject to letter of credit issuer limits as specified in paragraph (1) of Section 16.11.3.\n(d)\tThe Counter-Party may deposit cash with TEMSFM through ERCOT with the understanding that ERCOT may draw part or all of the deposited cash to satisfy any overdue payments owed by the Counter-Party to ERCOT for Securitization Default Charges.  The cash deposits may bear interest payable directly to the Counter-Party, but any such arrangements may not restrict ERCOT\u2019s immediate access to the cash.  \n(i)\tInterest on cash deposited pursuant to this Section will be calculated based on Counter-Party average cash deposit balance.  Interest is not paid on a cash deposit balance held by TEMSFM where, in accordance with paragraph (4) of Section 16.11.7, Release of Market Participant\u2019s Financial Security Requirement, the Counter-Party\u2019s Standard Form Market Participant Agreement has been terminated and ERCOT has determined that no obligations for Securitization Default Charges remain owing or will become due and payable.\n(ii)\tOnce per year, ERCOT will return interest earned on a Counter-Party\u2019s cash deposits pursuant to this Section to the Counter-Party.\n(2)\tSecuritization Default Charge escrow deposits are held solely for the purpose of collateralizing SDCCE and shall not be used for any other purpose.  They are independent of and in addition to any other Financial Security obligations of the Counter-Party arising under Section 16.11, Financial Security for Counter-Parties, or Section 27, Securitization Uplift Charges. \n(3)\tFunds provided for Securitization Default Charge escrow deposits must be made to the account designated for Securitization Default Charge escrow deposits.  If a payment is not made to the correct account, ERCOT is not responsible for transferring the funds to the correct escrow deposit account.  Failure to remit funds to the correct account by the date and time required will result in a Late Payment and/or Payment Breach.\n(4)\tA Counter-Party with excess cash held with respect to one or more Securitization Default Charge escrow deposit requirements may request ERCOT to return some or all of the excess cash to the Counter-Party. \n(5)\tSecuritization Default Charge escrow deposits will not be used to pay periodic Securitization Default Charge Invoices unless there is an insufficient payment by the Invoice Recipient, in accordance with Section 26.3.1.2, Insufficient Payments by Invoice Recipients for Securitization Default Charge Invoices.\n(6)\tSecuritization Default Charge escrow deposits in excess of the SDCCE requirement shall not be used to cover insufficient payments of Settlement Invoices for ERCOT market activities under Section 9.19, Partial Payments by Invoice Recipients, or requests for additional Financial Security made in accordance with paragraph (6) of Section 16.11.5, Monitoring of a Counter-Party\u2019s Creditworthiness and Credit Exposure by ERCOT.  Further, Securitization Default Charge escrow deposits in excess of the SDCCE shall not be used to cover insufficient payments of Invoices or escrow deposit requirements under Section 27.\n26.5.4\tDetermination of Securitization Default Charge Credit Exposure for a Counter-Party\n(1)\tFor each Counter-Party, ERCOT shall calculate the SDCCE as follows:\nSDCCE cp  =   SDCMMARS cp, rm  *  \u2211_(fmd=1 )^nfmd\u2592(TSDCMA fmd)\nThe above variables are defined as follows:\nVariable\tUnit\tDescription\nSDCCE cp\t$\tSecuritization Default Charge Credit Exposure \u2013 Estimated credit exposure for each Counter-Party related to Securitization Default Charges.\nSDCMMARS cp, rm\tNone\tSecuritization Default Charge Maximum MWh Activity Ratio Share \u2013 The Counter-Party\u2019s pro rata share of Securitization Default Charge Maximum MWh Activity in the most recent available reference month rm based on Initial Settlements.\nTSDCMA\t$\tTotal Securitization Default Charge Monthly Amount \u2013 The amount ERCOT determines must be collected for the month in order to timely repay the Securitization Default Balance.\ncp\tnone\tA registered Counter-Party.\nrm\tnone\tReference Month \u2013 most recent available operating month \nfmd\tNone\tForward Month \u2013 a month from Securitization Default Charge forward months\nnfmd\tNone\tNumber of forward months \u2013 total number of forward months Securitization Default Charge is extrapolated\nThe above parameters are defined as follows:\nParameter\tUnit\tCurrent Value\nnfmd\tMonths\t4\n26.5.5\tMonitoring of a Counter-Party\u2019s Securitization Default Charge Credit Exposure by ERCOT\n(1)\tPursuant to Section 16.11.5, Monitoring of a Counter-Party\u2019s Creditworthiness and Credit Exposure by ERCOT, ERCOT shall monitor the credit exposure of each Counter-Party, including SDCCE.  \n(2)\tA Counter-Party is responsible at all times for maintaining Securitization Default Charge escrow deposits in an amount equal to or greater than that Counter-Party\u2019s SDCCE. \n(3)\tERCOT shall promptly notify each Counter-Party of the need to increase its Securitization Default Charge escrow deposit and allow the Counter-Party time, as provided in paragraph (5) below, to provide additional Securitization Default Charge escrow deposits to maintain compliance with this Section. \n(4)\tERCOT may suspend a Counter-Party when that Counter-Party\u2019s SDCCE, as defined in Section 26.5.4, Determination of Securitization Default Charge Credit Exposure for a Counter-Party, exceeds 100% of its Securitization Default Charge escrow deposit.  Any failure by ERCOT to send a Notice as set forth in this Section does not relieve the Counter-Party from the obligation to maintain appropriate Securitization Default Charge escrow deposits in amounts equal to or greater than that Counter-Party\u2019s SDCCE. \n(5)\tTo the extent that a Counter-Party fails to maintain Securitization Default Charge escrow deposit in amounts equal to or greater than its SDCCE, each as defined in Section 26.5.4: \n(a)\tERCOT shall promptly notify the Counter-Party of the amount by which its Securitization Default Charge escrow deposit must be increased and allow it: \n(i)\tUntil 1500 on the second Bank Business Day from the date on which ERCOT delivered the notice to increase its Securitization Default Charge escrow deposit if ERCOT delivered its Notice before 1500; or \n(ii)\tUntil 1700 on the second Bank Business Day from the date on which ERCOT delivered notification to increase its Securitization Default Charge escrow deposit if ERCOT delivered its notice after 1500 but prior to 1700.  \n(b)\tIf the Counter-Party does not increase its Securitization Default Charge escrow deposit to the required amount by the specified time, ERCOT may utilize Financial Security held with respect to other ERCOT market activities as determined under Section 16.11.4, Determination and Monitoring of Counter-Party Credit Exposure, up to the amount of the Securitization Default Charge escrow deposit shortfall. \n(c)\tIn the event that a Counter-Party is required to increase both its Securitization Default Charge escrow deposit and its Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposit, and ERCOT utilizes the Counter-Party\u2019s Financial Security, available Financial Security funds will be allocated on a pro rata basis to Securitization Uplift Charge and Securitization Default Charge escrow deposit requirements.\n(d)\tERCOT shall notify the QSE\u2019s Authorized Representative(s) and Credit Contact if it has not received the required security by 1530 on the Bank Business Day on which the security was due; however, failure to notify the Counter-Party\u2019s representatives or credit contacts that the required security was not received does not prevent ERCOT from exercising any of its other rights under this Section.\n(e)\tERCOT is not required to make any payment to a Counter-Party unless and until the Counter-Party increases its Securitization Default Charge escrow deposit to an amount equal to or greater than that Counter-Party\u2019s SDCCE.  The payments that ERCOT may not make to a Counter-Party include Invoice receipts, CRR revenues, CRR credits, reimbursements for short payments, and any other reimbursements or credits under any other agreement between the Market Participant and ERCOT.  ERCOT may retain all such amounts until the Counter-Party has fully discharged all payment obligations owed to ERCOT under the Agreement, other agreements, and these Protocols. \n(6)\tIf a Counter-Party increases its Securitization Default Charge escrow deposit as required by ERCOT by the deadline in paragraph (5)(a) above, then ERCOT shall release any payments held, providing the Counter-Party has no other payment deficiencies with respect to any other activity under these Protocols.\n26.5.6\tPayment Breach and Late Payments by Market Participants\n(1)\tIn the event of a Payment Breach or Late Payment by a Market Participant with respect to Securitization Default Charge Invoices or required Securitization Default Charge escrow deposits, all remedies specified in Section 16.11.6, Payment Breach and Late Payments by Market Participants, are applicable.\n26.5.7\tRelease of Market Participant\u2019s Securitization Default Charge Escrow Deposit Requirement\n(1)\tERCOT shall continue to retain all Securitization Default Charge escrow deposits to cover, if necessary, potential future obligations for Securitization Default Charges. \n(2)\tUpon ERCOT\u2019s sole determination that all potential Securitization Default Charge Invoices have been paid, ERCOT shall return or release any remaining Securitization Default Charge escrow deposits to a terminated Market Participant.",

A REP is responsible for maintaining current records of transmission-voltage Customers that are Securitization Uplift Charge Opt-Out Entities.  \n(2)\tERCOT, in its discretion, may seek information from a REP or Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) regarding a Securitization Uplift Charge Opt-Out Entity that is a transmission-voltage Customer of a REP if ERCOT has reason to believe that there has been a change of transmission-voltage Customer at an Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID) associated with the Securitization Uplift Charge Opt-Out Entity.  ERCOT may seek relief from the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) if ERCOT has reason to believe that there has been a change that disqualifies an ESI ID or the transmission-voltage Customer from continued treatment as a Securitization Uplift Charge Opt-Out Entity.\n(3)\tIf a Securitization Uplift Charge Opt-Out Entity is an Electric Cooperative (EC), Municipally Owned Utility (MOU), or river authority, but is not registered with ERCOT as a Load Serving Entity (LSE), and registers with ERCOT as an LSE or changes its LSE, then ERCOT may, as part of the LSE registration process, request that the Market Participant notify ERCOT of the Market Participant\u2019s status as a Securitization Uplift Charge Opt-Out Entity.  The failure of an EC, MOU, or river authority to notify ERCOT of its Securitization Uplift Charge Opt-Out Entity status in the LSE registration process will not impact the Market Participant\u2019s status as a Securitization Uplift Charge Opt-Out Entity.\n(4)\tA Securitization Uplift Charge Opt-Out Entity that is a REP must notify ERCOT within five Business Days of filing an application to amend its REP certification status or option type with the PUCT.\n(5)\tA Securitization Uplift Charge Opt-Out Entity that is a REP must notify ERCOT within five Business Days of the REP becoming the Competitive Retailer (CR) of Record for a Customer that is not an affiliate of the REP or that does not have the same corporate parent of the REP.\n(6)\tSubject to paragraph (2) above, if a transmission-voltage Customer of a REP is a Securitization Uplift Charge Opt-Out Entity, the only ESI IDs associated with the transmission-voltage Customer that will be included in the Adjusted Metered Load (AML) adjustments for Securitization Uplift Charge Opt-Out Entities made under Section 27.3 are the specific ESI IDs included in opt-out notifications filed by the opt-out deadline in PUCT Project No. 52364, Proceeding for Eligible Entities to File an Opt Out Pursuant to PURA \u00a7 39.653(d) and for Load-Serving Entities to File Documentation of Exposure to Costs Pursuant to the Debt Obligation Order in Docket No. 52322.  \n27.2.1\tReturn of Securitization Proceeds \n(1)\tIf an LSE is required under PURA \u00a7 39.664 or the Debt Obligation Order in Docket No. 52322 to return securitization proceeds, then the LSE must remit the proceeds to its Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE), and the QSE shall remit those funds to ERCOT within two Business Days of the QSE receiving the funds from the LSE.

If the second Bank Business Day is not a Business Day, the payment is due by 1700 on the next Bank Business Day after the second Bank Business Day that is also a Business Day.\n(2)\tAll Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoices due, with funds owed by an Invoice Recipient, must be paid to ERCOT in U.S. Dollars (USDs) by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) in immediately available or good funds (i.e., not subject to reversal) on or before the payment due date.  EFTs must be with U.S. banks only.\n(3)\tSecuritization Uplift Charge Initial Invoices are distinct from other Invoices issued by ERCOT and must be paid by an EFT that is separate from any other Invoice. An Invoice Recipient may not net amounts owing on a Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoice with any other funds due to or from ERCOT.\n(4)\tPayments for Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoices must be made to the account listed on the Invoice.  If payment is not made to the correct account, the payment will be rejected.  Failure to remit funds to the correct account may result in a Late Payment and Payment Breach.  The payment remarks must include the Invoice number.\n27.4.4\tInsufficient Payments by Invoice Recipients for Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoices\n(1)\tIf at least one Invoice Recipient owing funds does not pay its Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoice in full (short-pay) by the payment due date and time set forth in Section 27.4.1, Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoices, ERCOT shall follow the procedure set forth below: \n(a)\tERCOT shall draw on any available Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposit of the short-paying Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoice Recipient. \n(b)\tIf available Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposits are insufficient to cover the short-pay amount, ERCOT may utilize Financial Security held with respect to other ERCOT market activities as determined under Section 16.11.4, Determination and Monitoring of Counter-Party Credit Exposure.  ERCOT may not utilize Securitization Default Charge escrow deposits to cover short-pays of Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoices. \n(c)\tIn the event that an Invoice Recipient short-pays: \n(i)\tBoth a Securitization Default Charge Invoice and a Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoice; or \n(ii)\tOne or both of the above securitization Invoices as well as any other ERCOT Invoice,\nand it is necessary to utilize Financial Security held with respect to other ERCOT market activities, funds drawn from Financial Security will be allocated first to cover short-pays of Invoices for non-securitization activity.  Any remaining Financial Security will be allocated pro rata on the basis of unpaid Invoice amounts to Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoices and Securitization Default Charge Invoices.\n(d)\tRegardless of whether ERCOT\u2019s draw on an available Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposits or other Financial Security under paragraphs (a) through (c) above is sufficient to cover the amount owed by a Market Participant for an Initial Invoice for Securitization Uplift Charges, a Market Participant\u2019s failure to pay the Initial Invoice by the payment due date and time will still be deemed a Late Payment and Payment Breach under Section 16.11.6, Payment Breach and Late Payments by Market Participants.  \n(e)\tIf an amount owed to ERCOT for an Initial Invoice for Securitization Uplift Charges cannot be fully recovered from a short-paying Market Participant by drawing upon available Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposits or taking other action against the Market Participant to recover the amount owed, the remaining short payment amount will be taken into consideration in ERCOT\u2019s next evaluation of the Securitization Uplift Charge Daily Amount performed pursuant to paragraph (2) of Section 27.3, Securitization Uplift Charge, that occurs after the short payment. \n(f)\tAny action taken by ERCOT under this Section does not relieve or otherwise excuse the short-paying Market Participant of its obligation to fully pay all outstanding financial obligations to ERCOT, including its obligation to fully pay all Initial Invoices for Securitization Uplift Charges.\n27.4.5\tPayment Process for Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoices\n(1)\tPayments for Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoices are due on a Business Day and Bank Business Day basis as detailed below.\n27.4.5.1\tInvoice Recipient Payment to ERCOT for Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoices\n(1)\tThe payment due date and time for the Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoice, with funds owed by an Invoice Recipient, is 1700 on the second Bank Business Day after the Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoice date, unless the second Bank Business Day is not a Business Day.  If the second Bank Business Day is not a Business Day, the payment is due by 1700 on the next Bank Business Day after the second Bank Business Day that is also a Business Day.\n(2)\tAll Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoices due, with funds owed by an Invoice Recipient, must be paid to ERCOT in USDs by EFT in immediately available or good funds (i.e., not subject to reversal) on or before the payment due date.  EFTs must be with U.S. banks only.\n(3)\tThe Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoices are distinct from other Invoices issued by ERCOT.  An Invoice Recipient may not net amounts owing on a Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoice with any other funds due to or from ERCOT.\n(4)\tPayments for Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoices must be made to the account listed on the Invoice.  The payment remarks must include the Invoice number. If payment is not made to the correct account, the payment will be rejected.  Failure to remit funds to the correct account may result in a Late Payment and Payment Breach. \n27.4.5.2\tERCOT Payment to Invoice Recipients for Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoices\n(1)\tSubject to the availability of funds as discussed in paragraph (2) below, ERCOT must pay Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoices with funds owed to an Invoice Recipient by 1700 on the next Bank Business Day after payments are due for that Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoice under Section 27.4.5, Payment Process for Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoices, subject to ERCOT\u2019s right to withhold payments for any reason set forth in these Protocols or as a matter of law, unless that next Bank Business Day is not a Business Day.  If that next Bank Business Day is not a Business Day, the payment is due on the next Bank Business Day thereafter that is also a Business Day. \n(2)\tERCOT shall give irrevocable instructions to the ERCOT financial institution to remit to each Invoice Recipient for same day value the amounts determined by ERCOT to be available for payment to that Invoice Recipient under Section 27.4.6, Insufficient Payments by Invoice Recipients for Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoices. \n27.4.6\tInsufficient Payments by Invoice Recipients for Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoices\n(1)\tIf at least one Invoice Recipient owing funds does not pay its Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoice in full (short-pay), ERCOT shall follow the procedure set forth below:\n(a)\tERCOT shall make every reasonable attempt to collect payment from each short-paying Invoice Recipient before any payments owed by ERCOT for that Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoice are due to be paid to applicable Invoice Recipient(s). \n(b)\tERCOT shall draw on any available Financial Security, other than Securitization Default Charge escrow deposits or Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposits, pledged to ERCOT by the short-paying Invoice Recipient.  \n(c)\tRegardless of whether ERCOT\u2019s draw on available Financial Security under paragraph (b) above is sufficient to cover the amount owed by a Market Participant for a Securitization Uplift Charges, a Market Participant\u2019s failure to pay the Invoice by the payment due date and time will still be deemed a Payment Breach under Section 16.11.6, Payment Breach and Late Payments by Market Participants.\n(d)\tERCOT shall offset or recoup any amounts owed, or to be owed, by ERCOT for a Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoice to a short-paying Invoice Recipient, and ERCOT shall apply the amount offset or recouped to cover payment shortfalls by that Invoice Recipient for Invoices other than Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoices and Securitization Default Charge Invoices.\n(e)\tIf, after taking the actions set forth in the paragraphs above, and subject to paragraph (f) below, ERCOT still does not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts that it owes to Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoice Recipients in full, ERCOT shall reduce payments to all Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoice Recipients owed monies from ERCOT.  The reductions shall be based on a pro rata basis of monies owed to each Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoice Recipient, to the extent necessary to clear ERCOT\u2019s accounts on the payment due date to achieve revenue neutrality for ERCOT as to Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoices.  ERCOT shall provide to all Market Participants payment details on all short payments and subsequent reimbursements of short pays.  Details must include the identity of each short-paying Invoice Recipient and the dollar amount attributable to that Invoice Recipient, broken down by Invoice numbers.  In addition, ERCOT shall provide the aggregate total of all amounts due to all Invoice Recipients before applying the amount not paid on the Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoice.\n(f)\tFor a short-paying Market Participant whose Standard Form Market Participant Agreement has been terminated, if, after taking the actions set forth in the paragraphs (a) through (d) above, ERCOT still does not have sufficient funds to pay amounts owed to Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoice Recipients in full, ERCOT will draw on any Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposit amounts remaining after all Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoices for the short-paying Market Participant have been paid in full, in order to recover remaining unpaid Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoice amounts.  \n27.4.7\tEnforcing the Financial Security of a Short-Paying Reallocation Invoice Recipient\n(1)\tERCOT shall make reasonable efforts to enforce the Financial Security of the short-paying Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoice Recipient (pursuant to Section 16.11.6, Payment Breach and Late Payments by Market Participants) to the extent necessary to cover the short-pay.  A short-paying Invoice Recipient shall restore the level of its Financial Security as required under Section 27.5.2, ERCOT Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoice Credit Requirements for Counter-Parties.\n27.5\tSecuritization Uplift Charge Initial Invoice Escrow Deposit Requirements\n27.5.1\tSecuritization Uplift Charge Initial Invoice Escrow Deposits\n(1)\tThe term \u201cSecuritization Uplift Charge escrow deposit\u201d means the amount required to be deposited with ERCOT in the form of cash or an unconditional, irrevocable letter of credit to be held in escrow for a Market Participant\u2019s obligation to pay Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoices.\n(2)\tAlthough ERCOT is the servicer for the assessment and collection of Securitization Uplift Charges, by providing escrow deposits pursuant to this Section each Counter-Party grants the Texas Electric Market Stabilization Funding N LLC (TEMSFN) a secured interest in Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposits to secure its obligation to pay the same. \n(3)\tThe secured interest of TEMSFN is perfected upon a Counter-Party\u2019s deposit of cash or a letter of credit pursuant to this Section.\n27.5.2\tERCOT Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoice Credit Requirements for Counter-Parties\n(1)\tA Counter-Party must, at all times, maintain its Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposit at or above the amount of its Load-Allocated Securitization Uplift Charge Credit Exposure (LASUCCE), as determined pursuant to Section 27.5.4, Determination of Securitization Uplift Charge Credit Exposure for a Counter-Party.  Each Counter-Party shall maintain any required Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposit in a form acceptable to ERCOT in its sole discretion pursuant to Section 27.5.3, Means of Satisfying Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoice Credit Requirements, below.  \n(2)\tIf at any time the Counter-Party does not meet ERCOT\u2019s LASUCCE requirements, then the Counter-Party will be considered to be in Payment Breach and ERCOT may suspend the Counter-Party\u2019s rights and/or take other action authorized under these Protocols until the Counter-Party meets the LASUCCE requirements.\n(3)\tERCOT\u2019s failure to suspend a Counter-Party\u2019s rights on any particular occasion does not prevent ERCOT from suspending those rights on any subsequent occasion, including a Congestion Revenue Right (CRR) Account Holder\u2019s ability to bid on future CRRs or a Qualified Scheduling Entity\u2019s (QSE\u2019s) ability to bid in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM). \n27.5.3\tMeans of Satisfying Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoice Credit Requirements\n(1)\tIf a Counter-Party is required to provide a Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposit, then it may do so through one or both of the following means:\n(a)\tThe Counter-Party may give an unconditional, irrevocable letter of credit naming TEMSFN as the beneficiary.  ERCOT or the TEMSFN may reject the letter of credit if the issuer is unacceptable to ERCOT or the TEMSFN or if the conditions under which ERCOT or TEMSFN may draw against the letter of credit are unacceptable to ERCOT or TEMSFN.\n(b)\tAll letters of credit must be drawn on a U.S. domestic bank or a domestic office of a foreign bank, and must meet the requirements in Section 16.11.3, Alternative Means of Satisfying ERCOT Creditworthiness Requirements. \n(c)\tLetters of credit held as Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposits are subject to letter of credit issuer limits as specified in paragraph (1) of Section 16.11.3.\n(d)\tThe Counter-Party may deposit cash with TEMSFN through ERCOT with the understanding that ERCOT may draw part or all of the deposited cash to satisfy any overdue payments owed by the Counter-Party to ERCOT for Securitization Uplift Charges.  The cash deposits may bear interest payable directly to the Counter-Party, but any such arrangements may not restrict ERCOT\u2019s immediate access to the cash.  \n(i)\tInterest on cash deposited pursuant to this Section will be calculated based on Counter-Party average cash deposit balances.  Interest is not paid on cash deposit balances held by TEMSFN where, in accordance with paragraph (4) of Section 16.11.7, Release of Market Participant\u2019s Financial Security Requirement, the Counter-Party\u2019s Standard Form Market Participant Agreement has been terminated and ERCOT has determined that no obligations for Securitization Uplift Charges remain owing or will become due and payable.\n(ii)\tOnce per year, ERCOT will return interest earned on a Counter-Party\u2019s cash deposits pursuant to this Section to the Counter-Party.\n(2)\tSecuritization Uplift Charge escrow deposits are held solely for the purpose of collateralizing Securitization Uplift Charge Credit Exposure and shall not be used for any other purpose.  They are independent of and in addition to any other Financial Security obligations of the Counter-Party arising under Section 16.11, Financial Security for Counter-Parties, or Section 26, Securitization Default Charges. \n(3)\tFunds provided for Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposits must be made to the account designated for Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposits.  If a payment is not made to the correct account, ERCOT is not responsible for transferring the funds to the correct escrow deposit account.  Failure to remit funds to the correct account by the date and time required will result in a Late Payment and/or Payment Breach.\n(4)\tA Counter-Party with excess cash with respect to Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposit requirements may request ERCOT to return some or all of the excess cash to the Counter-Party.\n(5)\tSecuritization Uplift Charge escrow deposits will not be used to pay periodic Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoices unless there is an insufficient payment by the Invoice Recipient, in accordance with Section 27.4.4, Insufficient Payments by Invoice Recipients for Securitization Uplift Charge Initial Invoices.\n(6)\tCash collateral posted in accordance with Section 16.11.3 may be used to pay Securitization Uplift Charge Reallocation Invoices.\n(7)\tSecuritization Uplift Charge escrow deposits in excess of the Securitization Uplift Charge Credit Exposure requirement shall not be used to cover insufficient payments of Settlement Invoices for:\n(a)\tERCOT market activities under Section 9.19, Partial Payments by Invoice Recipients;\n(b)\tRequests for additional Financial Security made in accordance with paragraph (6) of Section 16.11.5, Monitoring of a Counter-Party\u2019s Creditworthiness and Credit Exposure by ERCOT;\n(c)\tInsufficient payments of Securitization Default Charge Invoices under Section 26.3.1.2, Insufficient Payments by Invoice Recipients for Securitization Default Charge Invoices; or\n(d)\tRequests for Securitization Default Charge Escrow Deposits under Section 26.5, Securitization Default Charge Escrow Deposit Requirements.\n27.5.4\tDetermination of Securitization Uplift Charge Credit Exposure for a Counter-Party\n(1)\tFor each Counter-Party, ERCOT shall calculate the Securitization

Counter-Party\u2019s Creditworthiness and Credit Exposure by ERCOT, ERCOT shall monitor the credit exposure of each Counter-Party, including Securitization Uplift Charge Credit Exposure.  \n(2)\tA Counter-Party is responsible at all times for maintaining Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposits in an amount equal to or greater than that Counter-Party\u2019s Securitization Uplift Charge Credit Exposure. \n(3)\tERCOT shall promptly notify each Counter-Party of the need to increase its Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposit and allow the Counter-Party time, as provided in paragraph (5) below, to provide additional Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposits to maintain compliance with this Section. \n(4)\tERCOT may suspend a Counter-Party when that Counter-Party\u2019s LASUCCE, as defined in Section 27.5.4, Determination of Securitization Uplift Charge Credit Exposure for a Counter-Party, equals or exceeds 100% of its Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposit.  Any failure by ERCOT to send a Notice as set forth in this Section does not relieve the Counter-Party from the obligation to maintain appropriate Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposits in amounts equal to or greater than that Counter-Party\u2019s LASUCFME. \n(5)\tTo the extent that a Counter-Party fails to maintain Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposits in amounts equal to or greater than its LASUCCE, as defined in Section 27.5.4:\n(a)\tERCOT shall promptly notify the Counter-Party of the amount by which its Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposit must be increased and allow it: \n(i)\tUntil 1500 on the second Bank Business Day from the date on which ERCOT delivered the Notice to increase its Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposit if ERCOT delivered its Notice before 1500; or \n(ii)\tUntil 1700 on the second Bank Business Day from the date on which ERCOT delivered Notification to increase its Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposit if ERCOT delivered its Notice after 1500 but prior to 1700.  \n(b)\tIf the Counter-Party does not increase its Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposit to the required amount by the specified time, ERCOT may utilize Financial Security held with respect to other ERCOT market activities as determined under Section 16.11.4, Determination and Monitoring of Counter-Party Credit Exposure, up to the amount of the Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposit shortfall. \n(c)\tIn the event that a Counter-Party is required to increase both its Securitization Default Charge escrow deposit and its Securitzation Uplift Charge escrow deposit, and ERCOT utilizes the Counter-Party\u2019s Financial Security, available Financial Security funds will be allocated on a pro rata basis to Securitization Uplift Charge and Securitization Default Charge escrow deposit requirements.\n(d)\tERCOT shall notify the QSE\u2019s Authorized Representative(s) and Credit Contact if it has not received the required security by 1530 on the Bank Business Day on which the security was due; however, failure to notify the Counter-Party\u2019s representatives or credit contacts that the required security was not received does not prevent ERCOT from exercising any of its other rights under this Section.\n(e)\tERCOT is not required to make any payment to that Counter-Party unless and until the Counter-Party increases its Securitization Uplift Charge escrow deposit to an amount equal to or greater than that Counter-Party\u2019s LASUCCE.

The portion of the monthly network management fee for ERCOT\u2019s work will not exceed $450 per month.\nERCOT Load Resource Registration and Generator Interconnection or Modification fees\tNA\t$500 for registration of a new Load Resource. \nIf a Resource Entity seeks to increase the MW size of an existing Load Resource by more than 20% or change the Load Resource\u2019s registration between non-Controllable Load Resource and Controllable Load Resource, it will incur a registration fee of $500.\nThe term \u201cgenerator,\u201d as used in this fee schedule relating to interconnection fees and Full Interconnection Study (FIS) Application fees, includes Generation Resources, Energy Storage Resources (ESRs), and Settlement Only Generators (SOGs) but, as reflected below, Settlement Only Distribution Generators (SODGs) will incur a different fee amount than transmission connected SOGs.  The following fee amounts apply for the registration of a new generator:  \n$2,300 for SODGs; \n$8,000 for generators that are less than 10 MW (other than SODGs); and\n$14,000 for generators that are 10 MW or greater.\nIf a Resource Entity for an existing SODG seeks to change its registration to a Distribution Generation Resource (DGR) it will incur a registration fee of $8,000.\nIf a Resource Entity seeks to make a modification that is covered by paragraph (1)(c) of Planning Guide Section 5.2.1, Applicability, to an existing generator it will incur a registration fee in association with the modification request.  If, at the time the modification is submitted, the cumulative MW amount of the modification and any other modifications that have been submitted for that generator within the last 12 months amount to less than 10 MW, the registration fee will be $2,300.  If, at the time the modification is submitted, the cumulative MW amount of the modification and any other modifications that have been submitted for that generator within the last 12 months amount to 10 MW or greater, the registration fee will be $14,000.\nFull Interconnection Study (FIS) Application fee\tNA\t$3,000 for an FIS Application relating to a new generator.\n$2,700 for an FIS Application relating to modification of an existing generator.\nQualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) Application fee\t9.16.2\t$500 per Entity\nSubordinate QSE (Sub-QSE) Application fee\t9.16.2\t$500 per Sub-QSE\nCompetitive Retailer (CR) Application fee\t9.16.2\t$500 per Entity\nCongestion Revenue Right (CRR) Account Holder Application fee\t9.16.2\t$500 per Entity\nIndependent Market Information System Registered Entity (IMRE) fee\t9.16.2\t$500 per Entity\nResource Entity Application fee\t9.16.2\t$500 per Entity\n\nTransmission and/or Distribution Service Providers (TDSPs)\t9.16.2\t$500 per Entity\n\nCounter-Party Background Check fee\t9.16.2\t$350 per Principal\nWeatherization Inspection fees\tNA\n\nResource Entities with Generation Resources or ESRs and Transmission Service Providers (TSPs) shall pay fees to ERCOT for costs related to weatherization inspections conducted pursuant to 16 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) \u00a7 25.55, Weather Emergency Preparedness, as provided below.     \nTSPs shall pay an inspection fee of $4,500 for each of their substations or switching stations that are inspected.\nEach Resource Entity to which this Section applies, other than those that own or control Generation Resources and ESRs that are federally owned, shall pay an inspection fee calculated as the Semiannual Generation Resource Inspection Costs * (Resource Entity MW Capacity/Aggregate MW Capacity).  ERCOT will perform this calculation twice per calendar year and gather the necessary MW capacity data for that six-month period on one of the last 15 Business Days at the end of the period.  Terms used in this formula are defined as follows: \nSemiannual Generation Resource Inspection Costs for purposes of this Section equals the sum of outside services costs, ERCOT internal costs, and overhead costs related to weatherization inspections, less inspection fees that will be invoiced to TSPs and Resource Entities with Generation Resources and ESRs that are federally owned, for that six-month period.  \nResource Entity MW Capacity for purposes of this Section equals the total MW capacity (using real power rating) associated with a Resource Entity with Generation Resources or ESRs.  \nAggregate MW Capacity for purposes of this Section equals the total MW capacity (using real power rating) of all the Resource Entities, other than Generation Resources and ESRs that are federally owned.  \nResource Entities with Generation Resources and ESRs that are federally owned shall pay an inspection fee of $4,500 for each of the Resources that are inspected.\nERCOT will issue Invoices semiannually in the months of January and July for the preceding six-month period to the Resource Entities and TSPs that owe inspection fees.  Payment of the fee will be due within 30 days of the Invoice date and late payments will incur 18% annual interest.  Entities that fail to pay their Invoice on time will be publicly reported in a filing with the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT).  Further payment terms and instructions will be included on the Invoice.\nVoluminous Copy fee\tNA\t$0.15 per page in excess of 50 pages\nActual Costs associated with Information Requests \tNA\tERCOT will provide an estimate to the requestor of any vendor or third-party costs ERCOT deems appropriate to fulfill the information request.  If the requestor approves the cost estimate, the requestor must pay all such costs as instructed by ERCOT before the information will be delivered to the requestor. \nERCOT Labor Costs for Information Requests\tNA\t$15 per hour of ERCOT time.\nIf ERCOT determines that a request will involve a substantial burden on ERCOT employee or contractor time to fulfill the request, ERCOT will provide an estimate to the requestor of the anticipated labor costs.  If the requestor approves the cost estimate, the requestor must pay all such labor costs as instructed by ERCOT before the information will be delivered to the requestor.\nERCOT Training fees for courses that award Continuing Education Hours (CEHs) \tNA\t$25 per North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) CEH.  \nExamples of such trainings include, without limitation, the Operator Training Seminar and Black Start Training.\nCybersecurity Monitor fee for Non-ERCOT Utilities that participate in the Texas Cybersecurity Monitor Program\tNA\tThe Cybersecurity Monitor fee amount varies from year to year.
