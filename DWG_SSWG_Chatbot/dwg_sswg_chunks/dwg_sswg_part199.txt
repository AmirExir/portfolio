cles and then a step change back to nominal voltage).  The facility should inject reactive current during the fault.  Following the fault the facility should return to a stable operating point with full real power output.  Any oscillations should be well damped.

3.1.5.7 Small Frequency Disturbance Test (all facilities)
Apply a 0.3 Hz step increase, and in a separate simulation, a 0.3 Hz step decrease of system frequency from nominal frequency (60Hz).  The governor or frequency controller should lower or raise the real power dispatch according to the droop and deadband characteristic.  A frequency response is required for all Generation Resources and Energy Storage Resources (ESRs) assuming there is sufficient headroom to respond to frequency changes.  The real power should initially be dispatched at 80% of maximum for this test. Tests for ESRs should also be run for a condition at 80% of maximum charging capability.  Since Intermittent Renewable Resources (IRRs) typically operate in a
